machine-learning nanodegree program my name is luis serrano and i'm a course developer here at Udacity but before I work here I was working on machine learning at Google for a few years I was using machine learning algorithms to generate video recommendations at YouTube machine learning is widely used for many cool things such as image and voice recognition spam detection fraud detection stock market teaching a computer how to play chess and of course self-driving cars so it may sound like something so useful must be pretty complicated but I'm here to show you that machine learning is actually pretty easy and most importantly a lot of fun so first off what is machine learning well we have the world and in the world we have humans and we have computers and one of the main differences between humans and computers is that humans learn from past experiences whereas computers need to be told what to do the interview programmed and now the question is can we get computers to learn from experience too and the answer is yes we can and that is precisely what machine learning is teaching computers to learn to perform tasks from past experiences of course for computers past experiences are just recorded as data so together we're going to look at a few examples in which we can teach the computer to learn from previous data and most importantly I'm going to show you that machine learning is actually pretty easy and nothing to fear","1RonLycEJ34":"okay so we'll start an example we are the App Store or Google Play and our goal is to recommend apps to users so to each user we're going to try to recommend them the app they are most likely to download so here we have a table of data that we're going to use to make the rules and the table contains six people and for each one of these six people we have recorded their gender and their age and the app they downloaded so for example the first person is a 15 year old female and she downloaded Pokemon go so here's a quiz between gender and age which one seems more decisive for predicting what app will the users download submit your answer below","h8zH47iFhCo":"well let's first look at gender if we split them by gender then the females downloaded Pokemon go and what's up and the male's downloaded Pokemon go and snapchat so there's not much of a split there but if you look at age we realize that everybody under 20 year old download Pokemon go and everybody who is 20 or older didn't this is a nice split so the feature the best splits the data is age therefore if you said age that is correct so what we'll do is we add a question here the question is are you younger than 20 if you are then we'll recommend Pokemon go to you if not then we'll see if you're 20 or older then we look at the gender it seems that if you are a female then you download it what's up and if you're a male you download it snapchat so we had another question here which is are you female or male if you're a female then we recommend you what's up and if you're a male then we recommend you snapchat what we end up here is with a decision tree the decisions are given by the questions we asked and this decision tree was built with this data and now whenever we have a new user we can put them through this decision tree and recommend them whatever app the tree suggests to recommend if it's a person under 20 we recommend them Pokemon go if it's a person who is 20 or older then we check the gender if it's a female then we recommend her what's up and if it's a male then we recommend him snapchat obviously there won't always be a tree that perfectly fits our data but in this class we're gonna learn an algorithm which will help us find the best fitting tree to a table of data","jsLkVYXmr3E":"okay now we're going to look at another example we are going to build an email spam detection classifier and how do we do it we do it by looking at previous data the previous data is a hundred emails that we've already looked at out of these 100 emails we have manually flagged 25 of them as spam and 75 of them as non spam now let's try to think of features that a spam email may be likely to display and analyze these features one feature could be for example containing the word cheap it seems reasonable to think that an email that contains the word cheap is likely to be spam so let's analyze this claim we look for the word cheap in all this 100 emails and find that 20 out of the 25 spam ones and 5 out of the 75 non-spam ones contain the word so we forget about the rest of the emails and focus only on the ones that contain the word cheap okay so time for a quiz here is the question based on our data if an email contains the word cheap what is the probability of this email being spam is it 40 percent 60 percent or 80 percent submit your answer below","YKN-fjuZ1VU":"so we can see that out of the 25 emails with the word cheap to any of them are spam while five of them are not this forms an 80\/20 split so the correct answer is 80% if you said 80 you are correct so from analyzing this data we can conclude a rule the rule says if an email contains the word cheap then the probability of that email being spam is 80% we then associate this feature with the probability 80% and we will use it to flag future messages as spam or not spam we can also look at other features and try to find their associated probability let's say we look at emails containing a spelling mistake and realize that the probability of an email containing a spelling mistake being spam is 70% and let's say we look at emails that are missing a title and the probability of those being spam is 95% and we can keep going finding different features that will predict if an email is spam or not so now when future emails come we can combine these features to guess if they are spam or not this algorithm is known as the naive Bayes algorithm","BEC0uH1fuGU":"okay so before we continue with other algorithms let's do a little aside let's say we found ourselves on tougher mountain mount ararat and our goal is to get to the bottom of the mountain so what strategy can we use well we can do it step by step we look around us in all the possible directions we can go and find out which direction will get us to descend the most in this case it's this direction over here so we take one step in that direction and then we restart the process we look around us and seeing which directions we descend the most and take a step at that direction and we continue this process until we descend the mountain this algorithm is called gradient descent and we'll be using extensively in machine learning you can think of the mountain as a problem you want to solve and the bottom of the mountain as the solution and our process to solve the problem is to take tiny steps in the correct direction that will get us to the solution","sf51L0RN6zc":"so let's say we're studying the housing market and our task is to predict the price of a house given its size so we have a small house that cost $70,000 and a big house that costs one hundred and sixty thousand dollars we'd like to estimate the price of this medium-sized house over here so how do we do it well first we put them in a grid where the x-axis represents the size of the house and square feet and the y-axis represents the price of the house and to help us out we have collected some previous data in the form of these blue dots these are other houses that we've looked at and we've recorded their prices with respect to their size and here we can see the small house is priced at $70,000 and the big one at a hundred and sixty thousand dollars now it's time for a small quiz what do you think is the best estimate for the price of the medium house given this data would it be eighty thousand dollars one hundred and twenty thousand dollars or one hundred and ninety thousand dollars submit your answer below","L5QBqYDNJn0":"well to help us out we can see that these points kind of form a line and we can draw the line that best fits this data now on this line we can see that our best guess for the price of the house is this point here over the line which corresponds to a hundred and twenty thousand dollars so if you said one hundred and twenty thousand dollars that is correct this method is known as linear regression you can think of linear regression as a painter who will look at your data and draw the best fitting line through it now you may be asking how do we find this line so let's try a small example let's try to fit the best line that fits through these three points over here obviously best line is subjective but we'll find some line that works well since we're pretending to be a computer we can't really eyeball the line so we're going to start by drawing a random line and seeing how bad this line is in order to see how bad this line is we calculate the error so we're going to look at the lengths of the distances from the line to the three points and we're gonna say that the error of this line is the sum of those three lengths now what we're going to do is to move this line around and see if we can reduce the error so let's say we move it in this direction and we calculate the error again it's given by these yellow distances we add them up and realize that we've just increased the error so that's not good let's try moving in the other direction then we move it and again calculate the error it's given by the sum of the green distances and we see that the error is smaller so we say let's take that step if we continue doing this procedure several times will always be decreasing the error and we'll finally arrive to a good solution in the form of this line this general procedure to minimize the error is known as gradient descent in real life since we don't want to deal with negative distances what we do is instead of finding the distances from the line to points we actually have their squares this procedure is called least squares so we're back here on the summit of Mount Everest and we're trying to descend to the bottom now in this context the higher we are the larger error is so descending means reducing the error now what do we do well we look at our surroundings and try to figure out which way can we descend more that's the equivalent of jiggling the line around and looking for the movement that reduces the error the most so for example here this seems to be the direction that makes us descend the most so we take a step in that direction that is the equivalent of moving the line one step in the direction that decreases the error the most in a way we're moving the line closer to the three points so now we've reduced our error and got closer to the bottom of the mountain then we can start the procedure again looking at our surroundings and deciding in what direction we descend the most or equivalently in what direction we get closer to the points then we start the procedure again and again looking at our surroundings and deciding in what direction we descend the most or equivalently in what direction we get closer to the points what we just did was reducing the error until we find its minimum value which gives us the best line fit","wQXKdeVHTmc":"now let's say we're the admissions office at a university and we're trying to figure out which students to admit we're going to admit them or reject them based on two pieces of information and entrance tests we provide them and their grades from school so for example here we have student 1 with scores of 9 in the test and 8 in the grades and that student got accepted we also have student 2 with scores of 3 in the test and 4 in the grades and that student did not get accepted and then a new student comes in student 3 this person has scores 7 and 6 and the question is should we accept them or not so to decide this let's first put them in a grid where the x-axis represents the score on the test and the y-axis represents the grades here we can see that student 1 would lie over here on the point with coordinates 9 8 and student 2 would lie over here in the points with coordinates 3 and 4 so in order to see if we should accept or reject student 3 we'll try to find a trend in the data for this we look at previous data in the form of all students we've already accepted or rejected it turns out that the previous data looks like this the green dots represent students that we've previously accepted and the red dots represent students that we've previously rejected okay so time for a quiz based on this previous data do we think student 3 gets accepted yes or no submit your answer below","JuAJd9Qvs6U":"to answer this question let's look closely at the data it seems that the red and green dots are nicely separated by a line here's the line and we can see that most points over it are green whereas most points under it are red with some exceptions so that line is going to be our model and from now on every time we get a new student we check their scores and plot them in this graph if they end up over the line we predict that they'll get accepted and if they end up below the line we predict that they'll get rejected so since student 3 ends up here at the point with coordinates 7 and 6 which is over the line we conclude that the student gets accepted so if you said yes that's the correct answer this method is known as logistic regression and now the question is how do we find this line the best cuts the data so let's look at a simple example how do we draw the line the best separates the green points from the red points well again a computer can't really eyeball the line so we can start by drawing a random line like this one and now given this line let's randomly say that we label the region over the line is green and the region under the line is red so just like with linear regression will first try to see how bad this first line is a simple measure of how bad the line is is just a number of errors that is the number of misclassified points this line misclassified two points one red and one green so we'll say it has two errors and again like with linear regression what we'll do is move the line around trying to minimize the number of errors using gradient descent so if we move the line a bit in this direction we can see that we start correctly classifying one of the points bringing down the number of errors to one and if we move it even more we correct classify the other one of the points bringing down the number of errors to zero in reality in order to properly use the gradient descent method it turns out that the number of errors is not need to minimize but instead something that captures a number of errors called a log loss function let's actually study that in more detail so here are six points again with four of them correctly classified to red and two green and two of them incorrectly classified one red and one green the error function will assign a large penalty to the two incorrectly classified points and small penalties to the four correctly classified points we'll actually learn the formula for the error function in the class now we obtain the error function by adding all the errors from the corresponding points here we obtain a large number since that two misclassified points add a lot to the error function now the idea is to jiggle a line around to minimize this error so if we move the line in this direction we can see that some errors decrease and some slightly increase but in general when we consider the sum the sum gets smaller since we've correctly classified the two points that were misclassified before so the point of this process is to find the best line fit by minimizing the error function and how do we minimize the error function again with great in descent so once more here we are at the summit of Mount Everest we're quite high up because our error is large here you can see how the height is the sum of the green and red areas so we explore around to see what direction brings us down the most or equivalently what direction can we move the line in order to reduce the error the most and we decide to take a step in that direction so now we're misclassifying only one of the points we can see how that decreases our error function bringing us down the mountain and we do it again we take a step in the direction that reduces the error of the most now we're at the bottom of the mountain since we reduce the error to its minimum possible value","Fwnjx0s_AIw":"okay so let's dive in a bit deeper into the art of splitting data into two we look at these six points and there seem to be many lines that split them for example there's this blue one and there is this yellow one so here's a question which of these two lines do we think cuts the data better the yellow one or the blue one submit your answer below","JrUtTwfnsfM":"well if we look at the blue line it seems like it's close to failing it's too close to two of the points if we were to perturbative and minimally it would miss classify one or more points the yellow line though seems to be nicely spaced and as far as it can from all the points so it seems like the best line is the yellow line therefore if you said the yellow line we agree and now the question is how do we find this yellow line well before finding the yellow line let's actually find a measure that tells us that the yellow line is better so the first observation is that these points far away from the boundary didn't matter much to our decision so let's forget about them and only consider the points close to the boundary actually we'll really have to focus is the distances from the points to the two lines and what tells us that the yellow line is better while the yellow line is better because somehow it's farther from the points than the blue line so we can just look at these four distances and notice that the smallest of those four distances is our measure of how close the line is to the points this means that what we have to consider then is the minimum of the four distances that's our measure of how close the line is to the points will call this measure the distance so we conclude that the yellow line is better because the minimum of all these distances is larger for the yellow line than for the blue line so this is the function we need to work with the minimum of the four distances and our goal is to make that minimum as large as possible in other words we need to maximize the distance and how do we maximize this distance you guessed it with gradient descent there are also other methods we can use which we will learn during the class this method is called a support vector machine the word support comes from the fact that the points close to the boundary are called a support","xFu1_2K2D2U":"okay so let's look more carefully at this model for accepting rejecting students let's say we have a student for who got nine in the test but one on their grades that student gets accepted according to our model since they are over here on top of the line but that seems wrong since the student got very low grades shouldn't get accepted so maybe it's too simplistic to think that this data can be separated by just a line right maybe the real data should look more like this where these students who got a load test score or low grades still do not get accepted so it seems that a line won't cut it anymore what's the next thing after a line maybe a circle a circle could work maybe two lines that could work too let's go with that let's go with two lines and how do we find these two lines again we can do it using gradient descent to minimize the similar log loss function as before this is called a neural network now the question is why is this called a neural network well let's say we're working in a very slow computer which can only do one thing at a time so it's not easy to just ask is this point in the area bounded by these two lines we have to split it into separate questions the first question is is the point over the blue line let's answer that question based on the four black points in the graph we can see that for these four points the answers are yes yes no and no the second question is is the point over the orange line and we can see that for the four points the answers are no yes no and yes now the third question we'll just take the answers from the previous two and combine them so the third question is are the answers two questions one and two both yes and we can see that for these four points the answers are no yes no and yes so they are all no except for the one that is in the green area now let's graph each question as a small note the first question is is the point over the blue line we have a node with the area and to input notes the test score and the grades for example we have a student where the test score is one and the grades are eight the note plots the point and checks if the point is on top of a black line and returns the answer yes or no the second question is similar we input tests and grades and the corresponding node will plot the point and return a yes or no depending on the point being on top of the orange line or not now the third question are the answers to questions one and two both yes we'll just take as inputs the answers to the two previous questions are returning yes the two answers are yes and a no otherwise this is known in logic as the end operator now this is where the magic happens if we join the notes for these three questions then we get a neural network and if we clean it up a bit we have the following the first column is where we input tests and grades and the second column is where we check at the point with coordinates corresponding to the test and the grades is on top of each one of the lines and the third layer in which we look at the answers from the previous layer and join them with the and operator so this is how our neural network will look now you may be thinking something's a little suspicious here the first two nodes look like they take values and check if the corresponding point is on top or below a certain line whereas the third node just takes yes or no and returns yes or no is it possible to see the third node that's one of the first two and the answer is yes so let's look at the and operator in more detail let's actually make a little table of what goes in and what goes out so when the and operator if we input a yes and yes we get it yes if we input a yes and a no we get a no if we input a no and a yes we're gonna know and finally if we input a no and a no we get a no now we can think of it yes as a one and then no as a zero in that case our table turns into this other one and now look at this operator in which we enter values 0 and 1 and check at the corresponding point with those coordinates it's over or below the line if we look at the points with coordinates 1 1 we get that this point is over the line on the green or positive region so we get a 1 now if we look at the points with coordinates 1 0 we see that it's under the line on the red or negative region so we get a 0 similarly for the point with coordinates 0 1 this point is under the line so we get a 0 and finally the point with coordinates 0 0 is under the line 2 so the answer is 0 again so this is how our final neural network looks on the Left we have what's called the input layer where in this case we're inputting the test scores and the grades here we have a case where the test score is 1 and the grades are 8 then this goes through a middle layer called the hidden layer which will help us with our computations so in here we consider the 1 and the 8 go become the point with coordinates 1 comma 8 on the two graphs in the next layer in the top node the point 1 comma 8 is on the green or positive region so the top node and made say yes in the bottom node the point 1 comma 8 is on the red or negative region so the bottom node emits an O now we remember that a yes is represented by a 1 and an O is represented by a 0 now the next layer called the output layer takes the values coming out of the middle layer namely the 1 and the 0 and it locates the point with coordinates 1 comma 0 this point is in the red or a negative region of the final node so the output here is a no does the neural network has received as inputs the values test equals 1 and grades equals 8 and it has output it and know this is a simple neural network but you can see how adding more notes in the middle or even more layers of notes can help us map more complex areas in the plane or even in three dimensions or higher dimensional spaces neural networks are a very powerful machine learning algorithm used in most state of the art projects such as recognition voice recognition playing chess and Sal driving cars and we call it a neural network because these nodes resemble neurons in the brain a neuron will take us input the output of other neurons in the form of nervous impulses and decide to fire nervous impulse or not in our case the neuron takes us input the output of other neurons in the form of numbers and decides to return a one or a zero","x0JqH6-Dhvw":"okay now we're gonna learn another very powerful method to split points in the plane so let's say we have these four points arranged like this and we want to split them it seems again that a line won't do the job since they're already over the line and the red ones are on the sides so we need to think outside the box one way to think out of the box is to use a curve like this to split them another one is to actually think outside the plane and think of the points as lying in three-dimensional space here are the four points over the plane we add an extra axis the z axis for the third dimension and if we can find a way to lift the two green points then we'd be able to separate them with a plane so what seems like the better solution to think within the plane and separate the points with a curve or to think of the points in space and separate them with a plane well it turns out that these two are actually the same method don't worry if it seems confusing we'll see it in more detail later this method is called a kernel trick and it's very well used in support vector machines okay so let's study one of them in more detail let's study the curve trick first let's start by putting coordinates on the points so this one is 0 3 this one is 1 2 this one is 2 1 and this one is 3 0 and what we need is a way to separate the green points from the red points so if the points coordinates are X comma Y maybe we need an equation on the variables x and y that gives us large values for the green points and small values for the red points or vice versa so which of the following equations could come to our rescue the sum of the two coordinates X plus y the product of the coordinates X Y or the first coordinate square X squared submit your answer below","dRFd6HaAXys":"this is not an easy question so let's actually make a table with the values of these equations on each of the four points here we have the four points on the top row and now each of the other rows will be one of the functions here's X plus y we fill in the first row as follows zero plus three equals three one plus two eagles three two plus one equals three and three plus zero equals three so we see that X plus y or the sum of the two coordinates is three for each one of the points for the second row we see that their products are zero times three equals zero for the first one one times two equals 2 for the second two times one equals two for the third and three times zero equals zero for the fourth and for the last one x squared we see that zero squared equals zero 1 squared equals 1 2 squared equals 4 and 3 squared equals 9 so let's think which of these equations separates the green and the red points we look at the sum X plus y and that gives us 3 at every value so it doesn't really separate them if we look at x squared so the first coordinate squared we get 0 and 9 for the red values and 1 & 4 for the green values this one also doesn't separate them since the red values are small and large 0 & 9 and the green values are in between 1 & 4 so we look at the product X Y and that gives us 0 for the red values and 2 for the green ones so it seems that this one does the job aright since it's a function that gives us one value for the red point and another value from the green points then it's a function that can tell red and green apart so if you said X Y that is correct that is the magic equation we'll use so let's see here we have our four points with coordinates X comma Y and the product of their coordinates x times y so for the red points X comma Y we have that the product X Y is 0 and for the Green Point X comma Y we have that the product X Y is 2 and what separates a 0 and a 2 well a 1 so the equation X y equals 1 will separate them and what is X y equals 1 it's the same as y equals 1 over X and the graph for y equals 1 over X is precisely this hyperbola over here that is the curve we want it ok now let's look at what happens in three dimensions and we recall that our magic equation which will separate the points is x times y so we have our points with coordinates 0 3 1 2 2 1 and 3 0 and here we have a copy of the plane with an extra axis the axis Z for height so let's add this magic equation x times y 2 our coordinates in other words let's consider the map from 2 dimensions to three dimensions which takes the point in the plane with coordinates X comma Y to the point in space with coordinates X comma Y comma x times y this map sends to point zero 3 to the point 0 3 0 the point 1 2 to the point 1 2 to the point 2 1 to the point 2 1 2 and the point 3 0 to the point 3 0 0 so in a different way it still separates the points since its sense the green points up by 2 and it leaves the red points underneath now what could separate this points well a plane could do it this is the way to visualize the kernel trick in three dimensions","ecREasTrKu4":"so you can think of logistic regression as a ninja who will look at your data and cut it in half based on the labels and we can think of a support vector machine as a slightly bigger ninja who will carefully look at the points in the boundary and make the cut based on those and in the same fashion we can think of a neural network as a team of ninjas who will look at your data and cut it into regions based on the labels and we can think of the kernel trick as another ninja who is slightly confused trying to split some apples and oranges suddenly she comes up with a great idea the idea consists of moving the apples up and the oranges down and then successfully cutting a line through between them now here's an exercise for you how would you solve the XOR problem that is which of the algorithms we learned would you use to separate these four points there's more than one solution give it a try","pv_i08zjpQw":"okay so let's say you have a chain of pizza parlors and we want to put three of them in this see we make a study and realize that the people who eat pizza the most live in these locations so we've decided that we'd like to put three pizza parlors and we need to know where are the optimal places to put them well it seems that the houses are nicely split into three groups the red the blue and the yellow so it would make sense to put one pizza parlor in each of the three groups but a computer doesn't know how to do this it can just eyeball the three groups we need an algorithm to do it so here's an algorithm that'll do it let's start by choosing three random locations for the pizza parlors so they are here where the stars are now it would make sense to say each house should go to the pizza parlor that is the closest to it in that case the yellow houses go to the yellow pizza parlor the blue houses go to the blue pizza parlor and the red houses go to the red pizza parlor but now look at how far the yellow houses are from the yellow pizza parlor it would make sense to move the yellow pizza parlor to the very center of its clientele and the same thing for the blue bits of parlor and the red pizza parlor so let's do that let's move each pizza parlor to the center of its clientele but now what happens look at these blue houses they are now much closer to the yellow pizza parlor than to the blue one so it would make sense for them to go to the yellow parlor instead let's go ahead and color them yellow same with these red houses over here they're closer to the blue pizza parlor now so let's color them blue and now again it would make sense to move each pizza parlor to the center of its clientele and again look at this red houses here they're closer to the blue pizza parlor than to the red one so let's go ahead and color them blue and again let's send every pizza parlor to the center of its clientele and now we have an optimal solution iterating this process took us from a random solution to the ideal one where we have one Pete a parlour at the center of each of the clusters of houses where the clients live this algorithm is called k-means clustering k-means clustering is useful when we have an idea of how many clusters we want to end up with now I'll leave you with a question what if we don't know how many clusters we want to end up with","1PldDT8AwMA":"here is a way to group the houses which doesn't require us to specify the number of clusters beforehand let's say the houses are arranged like this it would make sense to say the following if two houses are closed that they should be served by the same pizza parlor so going by this philosophy let's try to group the houses let's look at which houses are the closest to each other it's these two over here so we grouped those two now which are the next two closest houses it's these two over here so we grouped them the next two closest houses are these two so we grouped them and we keep going the next two closest houses are here and now something funny happens because one house is already grouped what we do is we join the clusters containing each of the houses the next two closest are here so we join the respective groups when the next two are here so we joined our groups and now the next two closest houses are these two over here but that's already too far so let's stop there what we did here is we pick the distance to begin with and said whenever the two closest houses are these distance apart we'll stop the algorithm that will control how far we want the clusters to be apart this algorithm is known as hierarchical clustering so we can see that hierarchical clustering is useful when we may not know the number of clusters but we have an idea about how far we want them to be","hJEuaOUu2yA":"congratulations together we've learned many of the main algorithms used in machine learning

absolutely our projects will get you to analyze existing data to solve real-life problems I look forward to answering these and many more questions and learning together in Udacity machine learning nanodegree program"},"manual_text":{"bYeteZQrUcE":"Hi. Welcome to Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Program. My name is Luis Serrano. I'm a course developer here at Udacity. But before I work here, I was working on machine learning at Google for a few years. I was using machine learning algorithm to generate video recommendations at YouTube. Machine learning is widely used for many cool things such as image and voice recognition, spam detection, fraud detection, stock market, teaching a computer how to play chess, and of course, self-driving cars. So, it may sound like something so useful, must be pretty complicated. But I'm here to show you that machine learning is actually pretty easy. And most importantly, a lot of fun. So, first stop. What is machine learning? Well, we have the world, and in the world, we have humans and we have computers. And one of the main differences between humans and computers is that humans learn from past experiences whereas computers need to be told what to do, then to be programmed. And now, the question is, can we get computers to learn from experience, too? And the answer is yes, we can. And that is precisely what machine learning is. Teaching computers to learn to perform tasks from past experiences. Of course, for computers, past experiences are just recorded as data. So, together, we're going to look at few examples in which we can teach the computer to learn from previous data. And most importantly, I'm going to show you that machine learning is actually pretty easy, and nothing to fear.","1RonLycEJ34":"Okay, so we'll start with an example. We are the apps store or Google Play. And our goal is to\nrecommend apps to users. So to each user, we're going to try to recommend them the\napp they are most likely to download. So here we have a table of data that\nwe're going to use to make the rules. And the table contains six people. And for each one of these six people,\nwe have recorded their gender, and their age, and the app they downloaded. So for example, the first person\nis a 15 year old female, and she downloaded Pokemon Go. So here's a quiz. Between gender and age, which one seems more decisive for predicting\nwhat app will the users download? Submit your answer below.","h8zH47iFhCo":"Well, let's first look at gender. If we split them by gender, then\nthe females downloaded Pokemon Go and WhatsApp and the males downloaded\nPokemon Go and Snapchat. So, there's not much of a split there. But if we look at age, we realize that everybody under 20\nyear old downloaded Pokemon Go. And everybody who is 20 or older didn't. This is a nice split. So the feature that best\nsplits the data is age. Therefore, if you said age,\nthat is correct. So what we'll do is we\nadd a question here. The question is,\nare you younger than 20? If you are,\nthen we'll recommend Pokemon Go to you. If not, then we'll see. If you're 20 older,\nthen we'll look at the gender. It seems that if you are a female,\nthen you downloaded WhatsApp. And if you are a male,\nyou downloaded Snapchat. So we add another question here. Which is, are you female or male? If you're a female,\nthen we recommend you WhatsApp. And if you're a male,\nthen we recommend you Snapchat. What we end up here,\nis with a Decision Tree. The decisions are given by\nthe questions we asked. And this Decision Tree\nwas built with this data. And now, whenever we have a new user, we\ncan put them through this Decision Tree. And recommend them whatever app\nthe tree suggests to recommend. If it's a person under 20,\nwe recommend them Pokemon Go. If it's a person who is 20 or\nolder, then we check the gender. If it's a female,\nthen we recommend her WhatsApp. And if it's a male,\nthen we recommend him Snapchat. Obviously, there won't always be\na tree that perfectly fits our data. But in this class, we're going to\nlearn an algorithm which will help us find the best fitting\ntree to a table of data.","jsLkVYXmr3E":"Okay, now we're going to\nlook at another example. We are going to build an email\nspam detection classifier. And how do we do it? We do it by looking at previous data. The previous data is 100 emails\nthat we've already looked that. Out of these 100 emails, we have\nmanually flagged 25 of them as spam, and 75 of them as non-spam. Now let's try to think of features that\na spam email may be likely to display and analyze its features. One feature can be for\nexample containing the word cheap. It seems reasonable to think that\nan e-mail that contains the word cheap is likely to be spam. So, let's analyze this claim. We look for the word cheap in at least\n100 emails and find that 20 out of the 25 spam ones and five out of the 75\nnon-spam ones contained the word. So, we forget about\nthe rest of the emails and focus only on the ones that\ncontained the word cheap. Okay, so time for a quiz. Here is the question. Based on our data,\nif an email contains the word cheap, what is the probability\nof this email being spam? Is it 40%, 60%, or 80%? Submit your answer below.","YKN-fjuZ1VU":"So we can see that out of the 25\ne-mails with the word, cheap, 20 of them are spam,\nwhile 5 of them are not. This forms an 80, 20 split,\nso the correct answer is 80%. If you said 80, you were correct. So from analyzing this data,\nwe can conclude a rule. The rule says,\nif an e-mail contains the word, cheap, then the probability of that\ne-mail being spam is 80%. We then associate this feature\nwith the probability, 80%, and we will use it to flag future\nmessages as spam or not spam. We can also look at other features and try to find their\nassociated probability. Let's say we look at e-mails containing\na spelling mistake and realize that the probability of an e-mail containing\na spelling mistake being spam is 70%. And let's say we look at e-mails\nthat are missing a title, and the probability of those\nbeing spam is 95%. And we can keep going, finding different features that will\npredict if an e-mail is spam or not. So, now, when future e-mails come, we can combine these features to\nguess if they are spam or not. This algorithm is know as\nthe Naive Bayes Algorithm.","BEC0uH1fuGU":"Okay, so before we continue with other\nalgorithms, let's do a little aside. Let's say we found ourselves\non top of a mountain. Mount Errorest. And our goal is to get to\nthe bottom of the mountain. So what strategy can we use? Well, we can do it step by step. We look around dozen all the possible\ndirections we can go and find out which direction will\nget us to descend the most. In this case,\nit's this direction over here. So we take one step in that direction. And then we restart the process. We look around us, and see in which\ndirections we descend the most. And take a step in that direction. And we continue this process\nuntil we descend the mountain. This algorithm is called\ngradient descent, and we'll be using it extensively\nin machine learning. You can think of the mountain as\na problem you want to solve, and the bottom of the mountain\nas the solution. And our process to solve\nthe problem is to take tiny steps in the correct direction\nthat will get us to the solution.","sf51L0RN6zc":"So let's say we're studying the housing market, and our task is to predict the price of a house given its size. So we have a small house that costs $70,000 and a big house that costs $160,000. We'd like to estimate the price of this medium-sized house over here. So how do we do it? Well, first we put them in a grid where the x-axis represents the size of the house in square feet and the y-axis represents the price of the house. And to help us out, we have collected some previous data in the form of these blue dots. These are other houses that we've looked at and we've recorded their prices with respect to their size. In here, we can see that small house is priced at $70,000 and the big one at $160,000. Now, it's time for a small quiz. What do you think is the best estimate for the price of the medium house given this data? Would it be $80,000, $120,000, or $190,000? Submit your answer.","L5QBqYDNJn0":"Well, to help us out, we can see that these points can form a line. And we can draw the line that best fits these data. Now on this line, we can see that our best guess for the price of the house is this point here over the line, which corresponds to $120,000. So if you said $120,000, that is correct. This method is known as Linear Regression. You can think of linear regression as a painter, who will look at your data and draw the best fitting line through it. Now you may be asking, how do we find this line? So let's try a small example. Let's try to fit the best line that fits through these three points over here. Obviously best line is subjective, but we'll find some line that works well. Since we're pretending to be a computer, we can't really eyeball the line. So we're going to start by drawing a random line and seeing how bad this line is. In order to see how bad this line is, we calculate the error. So we're going to look at the length of the distances  from the line to the three points. And we're going to say that the error of this line  is the sum of those three lengths. Now what we're going to do is to move this line around and see if we can reduce the error. So, let's say we move in this direction. And we calculate the error again. It's given by these yellow distances. We add them up and realize that we've just increase the error, so that's not good. Let's try moving in the other direction then. We move it and again calculate the error. It's given by the sum of the green distances. And we see that the errors smaller, so we say, let's take that step. If we continue doing this procedure several times, we'll always be decreasing the error, and we'll finally arrived to a good solution in the form of this line. This general procedure to minimize the error, is known as Gradient Descent. In real life, since we don't want to deal with negative distance. What we do, is instead of finding the distances from the line to the points, we actually have their squares. This procedure is called Least Squares. So we're back here on the summit of Mount Errorest, and we're trying to descent to the bottom. Now in this context, the higher we are, the larger our error is. So descending means reducing the error. Now what do we do? Well, we look at our surroundings and try to figure out which way we can descend more. That's the equivalent of jiggling the line around and looking for the movement that reduces the error the most. So for example here, this seems to be the direction that makes it descend the most. So we take a step in that direction. That is the equivalent of moving the line one step in the direction that decreases the error the most. In a way, we're moving the line closer to the three points. So now we've reduced our error and got closer to the bottom of the mountain, then we can start the procedure again. Looking at our surroundings and deciding in what direction we descend the most. Or equivalently, in what direction we get closer to the points. Then we start the procedure again and again, looking at our surroundings and deciding in what direction we descend the most, or equivalently, in what direction we get closer to the points. What we just did, was reducing the error until we find its minimum value, which gives us the best line fit.","wQXKdeVHTmc":"Now let's say we're the admissions\noffice at a university, and we're trying to figure out\nwhich students to admit. We're going to admit them or reject\nthem based on two pieces of information, an entrance test we provide them,\nand their grades from school. So for example, here we have student\none with scores of nine in test and eight in the grades, and\nthat student got accepted. We also have student two with\nscores of three in the test and four in the grades and\nthat student did not get accepted. And then a new student comes in,\nstudent three. This person scores seven and six, and the question is should we accept them or\nnot? So to decide this, let's first put them\nin a grid where the x axis represents the score on the test and\nthe y axis represents the grades. Here we can see that student one\nwould lie over here on the point with coordinates nine, eight, and student two would lie over here in the\npoint with coordinates three and four. So in order to see if\nwe should accept or reject student three,\nwe'll try to find the trend in the data. For this we'll look at previous data in\nthe form of all students we've already accepted or rejected. It turns out that the previous\ndata looks like this. The green dots represent students\nthat was previously accepted and the red dots represent students\nthat was previously rejected. Okay, so time for a quiz. Based on this previous data do we\nthink student three gets accepted? Yes or no? Submit your answer below.","JuAJd9Qvs6U":"To answer this question let's\nlook closely at the data. It seems that the red and green dots\nare nicely separated by a line. Here is the line and we can see\nthat most points over it are green, whereas most points under it are red,\nwith some exceptions. So that line is going to be our model\nand from now on, every time we get a new student, we check their scores and\nplot them in this graph. If they end up over the line,\nwe predict that they'll get accepted. And if they end up below the line,\nwe predict that they'll get rejected. So, since student three ends up here and\nthe point with coordinate seven and six which is over the line, we conclude\nthat the string gets accepted. So, if you said yes,\nthat is the correct answer. This method is known as,\nLogistic Regression. And now the question is, how do we find\nthis line that best cuts the data? So let's look at a simple example,\nhow do we draw the line that best separates the green\npoints from the red points? Well again the computer can't\nreally eyeball the line. And so, we can start by drawing\na random line like this one. And now given this line, let's\nrandomly say that we label the region over the line as green and\nthe region under the line as red. So just with linear regression, we'll first try to see how\nbad this first line is. A simple measure of how bad the line is,\nis just the number of errors. That is,\nthe number of misclassified points. This line misclassified two points,\none red and one green. So we'll say, it has two errors. And again with linear regression. What we'll do is, move the line around\ntrying to minimize the number of errors, using gradient descent. So if we move the line\na bit in this direction, we can see that we start correctly\nclassifying one of the points, bringing down the number\nof errors to one. And if we move it even more,\nwe correctly classify the other one of the points, bringing down\nthe number of errors to zero. In reality, in order to properly\nuse the gradient descent method, it turns out the number of errors\nis not what we need to minimize. But instead, something that captures the number\nof errors called log loss function. Let's actually study\nthat in more detail. So here are our six points again with\nfour of them correctly classified, two red and two green and two of them incorrectly classified,\none red and one green. The error function will assign\na large penalty to the two incorrectly classified points and small penalty to\nthe four correctly classified points. We'll actually learn the formula for\nthe error function in the class. Now we obtain the error function\nby adding all the errors from the corresponding points,\nhere we obtain a large number since the two misclassified\npoints add a lot to the error function. Now the idea is to, jiggle the line\naround to minimize this error. So if we move the line\nin this direction, we can see that some errors decrease and\nsome slightly increase. But in general, when we consider the\nsum, the sum gets smaller since we've correctly classified the two points\nthat were misclassified before. So the point of this process is, to find the best line fit by\nminimizing the error function. And how do we minimize\nthe error function? Again, with gradient descent. So once more, here we are at\nthe summit of Mount Errorest, we're quite high up, because our\nerror is large, we're you can see, how the height is the sum\nof the green and red areas. So, we explore around to see what\ndirection brings us down the most or equivalently. What direction can we move the line in\norder to reduce the error the most? And we decide to take\na step in that direction. So now, we're misclassifying\nonly one of the points. We can see how that decreases our\nfunction, bringing us down the mountain. And we do it again, we take a step in the direction\nthat reduces the arrow the most. Now, we're at the bottom\nof the mountains, since we were reduced the error\ntwist minimum, possible value.","Fwnjx0s_AIw":"Okay, so let's dive in a bit deeper\ninto the art of splitting data into two. We look at these six points and there\nseem to be many lines that split them. For example, there's this blue one and\nthere is this yellow one. So here's a quiz. Which of these two lines do we\nthink cuts the data better? The yellow one or the blue one? Submit your answer below.","JrUtTwfnsfM":"Well if you look at the blue line,\nit seems like its close to failing. It's too close to two of the points. If we were to pertobate it minimally,\nit would misclassify one or more points. The yellow line though seems\nto be nicely spaced, and as far as it can from all the points. So it seems like the best\nline is the yellow line. Therefore, if you said the yellow line,\nwe agree. And now the question is,\nhow do we find this yellow line? Well before finding the yellow line, let's actually find a measure that tells\nus that the yellow line is better. So the first observation is that these\npoints far away from the boundary, didn't matter much to our decision. So let's forget about them, and only consider the points\nclose to the boundary. Actually, what we really have to focus\nis the distances from the points to the two lines. And what tells us that\nthe yellow line is better? Well the yellow line is better because\nsomehow it's farther from the points than the blue line. So we can just look at these four\ndistances and notice that the smallest of those four distances, is our measure\nof how close the line is to the points. This means that what we have to\nconsider then is the minimum of the four distances. That's our measure of how close\nthe line is to the points. We'll call this measure the distance. So we conclude that\nthe yellow line is better. Because the minimum for\nall these distances is larger for the yellow line, than for the blue line. So this is the function we need to work\nwith, the minimum of the four distances. And our goal is to make that\nminimum as large as possible. In other words,\nwe need to maximize the distance. And how do we maximize this distance? You guessed it, with gradient descent. There are also other methods we can use\nwhich we will learn during the class. This method is called\nsupport vector machine. The word support comes from the fact\nthat the points close to the boundary are called the support.","xFu1_2K2D2U":"Okay so let's look more\ncarefully at this model for accepting rejecting students. Let's say we have a student four\nwho got nine on the test but one on their grades. That student gets accepted\naccording to our model, since they are over here\non top of the line. But that seems wrong, since the student got very low\ngrades shouldn't get accepted. So, maybe it's too simplistic to think\nthat this data can be separated by just a line, right? Maybe the real data should look more\nlike this where these students who got a low test score or\nlow grades still did not get accepted. So it seems that a line\nwon't cut it anymore. What's the next thing after a line? Maybe a circle? A circle could work. Maybe two lines? That could work too. Let's go with that. let's go with two lines. And how do we find these two lines,\nagain we can do it using gradient descent to minimize a similar\nlog lost function as before. This is called a neural network, now the question is why is\nthis called a neural network. Well let's say we're working in\na very slow computer which can only do one thing at a time. So it's not easy to just ask, is this point in the area\nbounded by these two lines? We have to split it into\nseparate questions. The first question is,\nis the point over the blue line? Let's answer that question based on\nthe four black points in the graph. We can see that for this four points. The answers are Yes, Yes, No, and No. The second question is,\nis the point over the orange line? And we can see that for the four points\nthe answers are No, Yes, No, and Yes. Now, the third question will just take\nthe answers from the previous two, and combine them. So the third question is, are the\nanswers to questions 1 and 2, both yes? And we can see that for\nthese four points, the answers are no, yes, no, and yes. So they are all no, except for\nthe one that is in the green area. Now let's craft each\nquestion as a small note. The first question is,\nis the point over the blue line? We have a node with the area and\ntwo input nodes. The test score and the grades. For example we have a student\nwhere the test score is one and the grades at eight. The node plots the point and checks that\nthe point is on top of the black line. And returns the answer, yes or no. The second question is similar, we input\ntest grades and the corresponding node. We'll plot the point,\nand return a yes or a no depending on the point being\non top of the orange line or not. Now, the third question. Are the answers to questions one and\ntwo both yes? We'll just take as inputs the answers\nto the two previous questions, and return a yes if the two answers\nare yes and a no otherwise. This is known in logic as the and\noperator. Now, this is where the magic happens. If we join the nodes for these three\nquestions, then we get a neural network. And if we clean it up a bit,\nwe have the following. The first column is where\nwe input testing grades. And the second column is where we\nchecked that the point with coordinates corresponding to the test and the grades\nis on top of each one of the lines. And the third layer in which we look at\nthe answers from the previous layers and join them with the and operator. So this is how our neural\nnetwork will look. Now you may be thinking something's\na little suspicious here. The first two nos look\nlike they take values and check if the corresponding point\nis on top or below a certain line. Whereas the third node just takes yes or\nno and returns yes or no. Is it possible to see the third\nnode as one of the first two? And the answer is yes. So let's look at the and\noperator in more detail. Let's actually make a little table\nof what goes in, and what goes out. So with the and operator if we put\na yes and a yes, we get a yes. If we input a yes and a no, we get a no. If we input a no and a yes, we get a no. And finally if we input a no and\na no, we get a no. Now, we can think of a yes as a one and\na no as a zero. In that case,\nour table turns into this other one. And now, look at this operator in which\nwe enter value zero and one and check if the corresponding point with those\ncoordinates is over or above the line. If we look at the points for\ncoordinates (1,1), we get that this point is over the line on the green or\npositive region, so we get a one. Now if we look at the points\nwith coordinates (1,0), we see that it's under the line\non the red or negative region. So we get a 0. Similarly for\nthe point with coordinates (0, 1), this point is under the line,\nso we get a 0. And finally, the point with coordinate\n(0, 0) is under the line too. So the answer is 0 again. So this is how our final\nneural network looks. On the left, we have what's called\nthe input layer, where in this case, we're inputting the test scores and\nthe grades. Here we have a case where the test\nscore is 1 and the grades are 8. Then this goes through a middle layer, called the hidden layer, which will\nhelp us with our computations. So in here we can see that the 1 and\nthe 8 go become the point with coordinates 1,8 on the two\ngraphs in the next layer. In the top node the point (1,8) is\non the green or positive region so the top node emits a yes. In the bottom node the point (1,8)\nfrom the red or negative region, so the bottom node emits a no. Now we remember that a yes\nis represented by a 1 and a no is represented by a 0. Now the next layer,\ncalled the output layer, takes the values coming out of the\nmiddle layer, mainly the 1 and the 0. And it locates the point\nwith coordinates (1, 0). This point is in the red or\nnegative region of the final node, so the output here is a no. Does the neural network\nhas received this inputs, the values test equals 1, and grades\nequals 8, and it has outputted a no. This is a simple neural network, but\nyou can see how adding more nodes in the middle or even more layers of\nnodes can help us map more complex areas in the plane or even in three\ndimensions or higher dimensional spaces. Neural networks are a very powerful\nmachine learning algorithm used in most state of the art projects\nsuch as facial recognition, voice recognition, playing chess,\nand self-driving cars. And we call it a neural network\nbecause these nodes resemble neurons in the brain. And neurons will take as input, the\noutput of other neurons in the form of nervous impulses and\ndecide to fire a nervous impulse or not. In our case the neuron takes as input\nthe output of other neurons in the form of numbers. And decides to return a 1 or a 0. [BLANK_AUDIO]","x0JqH6-Dhvw":"Okay, now we're going to learn\nanother very powerful method to split points in the plane. So let's say we have thee four\npoints arranged like this and we want to split them. It seems again that\na line won't do the job since they're already over the line and\nthe red ones are on the sides. So we need to think outside the box. One way to think out of the box is to\nuse a curve like this to split them. Another one is to actually\nthink outside the plane. And think of the points as lying\nin three dimensional space. Here are the four points over the plane. We add an extra axis,\nthe z axis for the third dimension. And if we can find a way to\nlift the two green points, then we'd be able to\nseparate them with a plane. So what seems like the better solution,\nto think within the plane and separate the points with a curve? Or to think of the points in space,\nand separate them with a plane? Well, it turns out that these two\nare actually the same method. Don't worry if it seems confusing,\nwe'll see it in more detail later. This method is called the Kernel Trick,\nand it's very well used in\nsupport vector machines. Okay, so let's study one of them in more\ndetail, let's study the curve trick. First, let's start by putting\ncoordinates on the points. So this one is (0,3). This one is (1,2). This one is (2,1). And this one is (3,0). And what we need is a way to separate\nthe green points from the red points. So if the points coordinates are (x,y),\nmaybe we need an equation on the variables x and\ny that gives us large values for the green points and small values for\nthe red points, or vice versa. So which of the following equations\ncould come to our rescue? [BLANK_AUDIO] The sum of the two coordinates x + y,\nthe product of the coordinates, xy or the first coordinates squared,\nx squared. Submit your answer below.","dRFd6HaAXys":"This is not an easy question. So let's actually make a table\nwith the values of these equations on each of the four points. Here we have the four\npoints on the top row. And now, each of the other rows\nwill be one of the functions. Here's x + y. We fill in the first row as follows,\n0 plus 3 equals, 1 plus 2 equals 3, 2 plus 1 equals 3,\nand 3 plus 0 equals 3. So, we see that x + y, or the sum of the two coordinates is 3 for\neach one of the points. For the second row we see that\nthe products are 0 times 3 equals 0 for the first one. 1 times 2 equals 2 for the second. 2 times 1 equals 2 for the third, and\n3 times 0 equals 0 for the fourth. And for the last one x squared\nwe see that 0 squared equals 0, 1 squared equals 1, 2 squared equals 4,\nand 3 squared equals 9. So let's think, which of these equations\nseparates the green and the red points. We look at the sum x + y and\nthat gives us 3 at every value, so it doesn't really separates them. If we look at x squared, so the first\ncoordinates squared, we get 0 and 9 for the red values and 1 and\n4 for the green values. This one also doesn't separate them\nsince the red values are small and large 0 and 9 and\nthe green values are in between 1 and 4. So we look at the product xy and\nthat gives us 0 for the red values, and\n2 for the green ones. So, it seems that this one does a job,\nright? Since it\u2019s a function that gives\nus one value for the red point and another value from\nthe green points then, it\u2019s a function that can tell red and\ngreen apart. So, if you said xy, that is correct. That is the magic equation we'll use. So let's see, here we have our 4\npoints with coordinates x,y and a products of the coordinates xy. So for the, red points x, y,\nwe have that the product xy = 0. And for the green points, x, y,\nwe have that the product xy = 2. And what separates a 0 and a 2? Well, a 1, so\nthe equation xy = 1 will separate them. And what is xy = 1? It's the same as y = 1\/x,\nand the graph for y = 1\/x is precisely\nthis hyperbola over here. That is the curve we wanted. Okay, now let's look at what\nhappens in three dimensions. And we recall that our magic equation,\nwhich will separate the points is xy. So we have our points with coordinates\n(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), and (3, 0). And here we have a copy of the plane\nwith an extra axis, the axis z, for height. So let's add this magic equation,\nxy, to our coordinate. In other words, let's consider the map\nfrom two dimensions to three dimensions, which takes the point in the plane with\ncoordinates (x, y) to the point in space with coordinates( x, y, xy). This map says the point (0,\n3) to the point (0, 3, 0). The point (1, 2) to the point (1, 2, 2). The point (2, 1) to the point (2, 1, 2). And the point (3, 0),\nto the point (3, 0, 0). So in a different way, it still\nseparates the point since it sends the green points up by 2, and\nit leaves the red points underneath. Now what could separate these points? Well a plane could do it. This is the way to visualize\nthe kernel trick in three dimensions.","ecREasTrKu4":"So you can think of\nLogistic Regression as a ninja, who will look at your data and\ncut it in half, based on the labels. And we can think of a Support Vector\nMachine, as a slightly pickier ninja who will carefully look at\nthe points on the boundary and make the cut based on those. And in the same fashion, we can think of\na Neural Network as a team of ninjas, who will look at your data and\ncut it into regions based on the labels. And we can think of\nthe Kernel Trick as another ninja, who's slightly confused trying to\nsplit some apples and oranges. Suddenly, she comes\nup with a great idea, the idea consists of\nmoving the apples up and the oranges down and then successfully\ncutting a line through between them. Now here's an exercise for you. How would you solve the XOR problem? That is,\nwhich of the algorithms we learned would you use to separate\nthese four points? There's more than one solution. Give it a try.","pv_i08zjpQw":"Okay, so let's say we have\na chain of pizza parlors and want to put three of them in the city. We make a study and realize that the people who eat pizza\nthe most live in these locations. So we've decided that we'd like\nto put three pizza parlors and we need to know where\nare the optimal places to put them. Well it seems that the houses\nare nicely split into three groups. The red, the blue, and the yellow. So it would make sense to put one pizza\nparlor in each of the three groups. But a computer doesn't\nknow how to do this. It can't just eyeball the three groups,\nwe need an algorithm to do it. So here's an algorithm that'll do it. Let's start by choosing three random\nlocations for the pizza parlors. So they are here, where the stars are. Now it would make sense to say each\nhouse should go to the pizza parlor that is the closest to it. In that case, the yellow houses\ngo to the yellow pizza parlor. The blue houses go to\nthe blue pizza parlor. And the red houses go to\nthe red pizza parlor. But now, look at how far the yellow\nhouses are from the yellow pizza parlor. It would make sense to move the yellow\npizza parlor to the very center of its clientele. And the same thing for the blue pizza\nparlor and the red pizza parlor. So let's do that. Let's move each pizza parlor to\nthe center of its clientele. But now what happens,\nlook at these blue houses. They're now much closer to the yellow\npizza parlor then to the blue one. So it would make sense for\nthem to go to the yellow parlor instead. Let's go ahead and color them yellow. Same with these red houses over here. They're closer to the blue\npizza parlor now. So let's color them blue. And now again, it would make sense to move each pizza\nparlor to the center of its clientele. And again, look at this red houses here, they're closer to the blue pizza\nparlor than to the red one. So let's go ahead and color them blue. And again, let's send every pizza\nparlor to the center of its clientele. And now we have an optimal solution. Iterating this process took\nus from a random solution to the ideal one where we have\none pizza parlor at the center of each of the clusters of houses\nwhere the clients live. This algorithm is called\nK-Means Clustering. K-Means Clustering is useful when we\nhave an idea of how many clusters we want to end up with. Now I'll leave you with a question. What if we don't know how many\nclusters we want to end up with?","1PldDT8AwMA":"Here's a way to group the houses which\ndoesn't require us to specify the number of clusters beforehand. Let's say the houses\nare arranged like this. It would make sense\nto say the following, if two houses are close they should\nbe served by the same pizza parlor. So going by this philosophy\nlet's try to group the houses. Let's look at which houses\nare the closest to each other. It's these two over here,\nso we group those two. Now, which are the next\ntwo closest houses? It's these two over here,\nso we group them. The next two closest houses are these\ntwo, so we group them and we keep going. The next two closest houses are here and now something funny happens because\none house is already grouped. What we do, is we join the clusters\ncontaining each of the houses. The next two clusters are here,\nso we join the respective groups. The next two are here,\nso we joined our groups. And now the next two closest\nhouses are these two over here. But that's already too far. So let's stop there. What we did here is we picked\na distance to begin with and said, whenever the two closest houses are this\ndistance apart we'll stop the algorithm. That will control how far we\nwant the clusters to be apart. This algorithm is known as\nhierarchical clustering. So we can see that hierarchical\nclustering is useful when we may not know\nthe number of clusters, but we have an idea about how\nfar we want them to be.","hJEuaOUu2yA":"Congratulations, together\nwe've learned many main algorithms used\nin machine learning.
