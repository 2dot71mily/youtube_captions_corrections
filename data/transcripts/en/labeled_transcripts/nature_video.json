courtesy of the event horizon telescope creating this image required more data than any other scientific experiment in history so how did they do it up until now most measurements of black holes were indirect like this time lapse of stars at the centre of our galaxy the stars seem to be orbiting around something something with a humongous gravitational pool scientists predicted that thing was a black hole astronomers have also seen massive Jets of matter emanating from the Centers of galaxies sometimes much larger than the galaxies themselves they predict that the only thing powerful enough to create them would be black holes the gravitational waves detected by Lyell in 2015 where the most direct and compelling evidence for black holes today but detecting gravitational waves is sort of like fearing black hole scientists still wanted to see it but how do you take a picture of a black object against the black background the answer backlighted matter should emit radiation as it heats up while circling the edge of a black hole the event horizon with a big enough telescope scientists should be able to use that radiation as a backdrop to see the silhouette of the black hole itself but it's tricky even though the black hole is gigantic and has galactic scale impacts it is so far away to get an image of high enough resolution scientists calculated they'd need a telescope the size of the earth which is obviously impossible enter the event horizon telescope which is not in fact one telescope but a network of eight observatories spread around the world from Hawaii to Antarctica each Observatory provides a tiny piece of the puzzle take repeated readings as the Earth spins and you can capture more angles from each telescope once you have enough pieces of the puzzle algorithms can fill in the gaps and build up the whole picture this process is called interferometry the observations used to create this image were made over a few nights in 2017 each night each Observatory gathered the same amount of data as the Large Hadron Collider does in a year and it has taken two years to piece it all together with this image we can see a black hole for the first time but it's much more than images it provides precise tests of reproductions of general relativity and what's more beyond the event horizon is a place where physics as we know it no longer works this is the first direct image ever taken of a black hole but coded in its pixels could be the answers to questions about the hole [Music]","QrnfIYFyFDY":"Stephen Hawking was one of the most influential scientists of his generation from black holes through Simpsons his impact on science and popular culture is hard to overestimate in this video we're going to look at just three publications that shaped his career number one the singularities of gravitational collapse and cosmology this paper was published in 1970 it was a time when physicists were still finding some of the implications of general relativity hard to swallow in particular the possibility of black holes and infinitely dense singularities Hawking and others had already shown that singularities should form at least in an abstract mathematical setting in fact in his PhD thesis Hawking had explored how the universe itself might have originated from a singularity at the beginning of time but in the 1970 paper Hawking worked with eminent physicist Roger Penrose and showed that general relativity even in the real world really does predict singularities number two black hole explosions as time went on Stephen Hawking's name would become inextricably linked with black holes this paper really was called black hole explosions with a question mark he has a knack for grabbing people's attention it describes what came to be known as Hawking radiation which many physicists regardless his most important legacy Hawking was trying to reconcile two seemingly incompatible theories one was general relativity which works well for describing the largest scales in the universe the other was quantum theory which describes the smallest scales  realized that if you believe both theories the event horizon or black holes should emit radiation he had shown that black holes are not actually black to this day physicists continue to argue over the implications of Hawking radiation and in particular about whether it raises information from the universe which would violate quantum theory and finally number three a brief history of time this is not a scientific paper but rather a popular science book and it is this book which would catapult Hawking from prominent scientists to probably the most famous scientist of his time it gave him a new platform as a science communicator a spokesperson and a cultural phenomenon ever since people around the world have been fascinated by his story his intellect and his tenacity many now know Stephen Hawking for his characteristics and Teddy points his appearances on television shows or his controversial opinions on a whole host of issues from a pie through to any life but behind the pop-culture icon there was a scientist whose legacy will endure and as Hawking himself once said I hope I will be remembered for my work on black holes and the origin of the universe not for things like appearing on The Simpsons you","gmIImZ8uiOs":"scientists think they've made the first measurements from the cosmic dawn the period in the universe's history when the first stars began to shine but how can scientists study something that happened more than thirteen and a half billion years ago well to understand that you need to start with hydrogen hydrogen is a cosmologists best friend they use it to study everything you see a quirk of hydrogen is that it can emit photons as it switches between states specifically photons with a wavelength at around 21 centimeters when astronomers point radio telescopes at the sky they see a mess of different radio waves but nestled in there is always that 21 centimeter line these emissions from hydrogen have helped scientists to map the universe it's how they discovered that we're sitting in a huge spiral-shaped galaxy the Milky Way but hydrogen isn't just useful for studying the universe today right after the Big Bang the universe was a dark soup of electrons and protons the particles soon clumped together as hydrogen and after hundreds of millions of years hydrogen collected into stars generating light cosmologists called this the cosmic dawn that primordial light is hard to see with a telescope because the tiny amounts of light made by the first stars would be extremely faint so scientists have taken a slightly different tack you see when that light was first created it changed everything including the hydrogen itself crucially making it able to absorb radiation at its favorite 21 centimeter line with this in mind rather than look for emission from hydrogen cosmologists have looked instead for its absorption they turned to the Cosmic Microwave Background the mass of radiation left over from the Big Bang in theory the moment light hit that early hydrogen it would have started absorbing this radiation and that should have left a blip in the CMB and that after decades of scouring for evidence from this time and two years of verification is what cosmologists have found but here's where it gets interesting the signal they found is not at 21 centimeters anymore because space itself is expanding that line has stretched over time which is handy for us because the amount of stretching the wavelength for light is it now tells us how long the light has traveled and so when those stars formed finally this allows scientists to put some dates to the beginning of the cosmic dawn but that is nor well the time the first stars formed seems about right the signal is way bigger than cosmologists predicted a lot more radiation was absorbed from this cosmic microwave background that makes sense given what we know so far about the early universe something doesn't add up and one tantalizing possibility is that we may be seeing the influence of dark matter now this is far from confirmed but if true it would give us a wealth of information about Dark Matters properties and where to look for it so this little blip could not only give us a snapshot of the first stars but it could be the key to unlocking one of the biggest mysteries in physics","jswSJznyvDI":"this hanging mass is made entirely of bees the swarm can hold itself together even when shaken about by the wind now a team of scientists have been finding out how about once a year colonies of honeybees leave their nests in swarms searching for a new home until they find a new site the bees rest in these temporary clusters the clusters often found in trees but this one is forming in a lab at Harvard in Massachusetts little do the bees know they're about to go for a ride the researchers built this shaking apparatus to investigate how the bee swarm reacts to movement when shaken from side to side shearing forces act on the colony with the bees at the top taking the brunt of it as they try to hold up everything beneath them the forces threaten to destabilize the whole colony so the bees do something clever they spread out the flatter shape changes the colonies center of mass and so it wobbles less reducing the pressure on the bees it makes sense imagine you're standing up and you find the ground shaking beneath you instinctively you'd crouch down same principle anyway what's particularly interesting here is that the forces at play are acting on the swarm as a whole but each bee can't see the shape of the swarm so how does it know where to go or what to do to find out researchers trapped the bees on the outside of the swarm as the colony shook they moved upwards to where the stress is greatest the researchers modeled this behavior and found that if all the bees follow the rule move towards the area of higher stress the colony flattens out increasing its stability and so decreasing the average stress on each bead great for the colony but individual bees are actively putting themselves under more stress to do it this kind of altruistic behave is not very common in nature except that is in use social insects like bees and ants which rely on altruism for survival what's more even though each individual bee doesn't necessarily know what's going on by simply moving towards an area of higher stress the colony as a whole acts intelligently this is called emergent intelligence and some scientists think that it's through a process like this that individual neurons firing in our brain can collectively come together to make well us talk about a hive mind","jOnxr9Ez_Kc":"to the human eye there appears to be a glowing three-dimensional butterfly moving around inside this black box in fact all it is is a tiny polystyrene bead that's really small yeah it's like a one millimeter to Namita with if suspended and we can move it so fast to create a 3d shape this is a volumetric display it's an image that exists in real 3d space and this latest development in the field is unique in that it uses sound waves not only to create the image but also to add audio and tactile sensations oh yeah you can feel it's like really Oh like it's kind of gentle buzzer breeze my name's Lizzie Gibney and I've come to the University of Sussex in the UK to see that display for myself the most surprising thing about it is that it doesn't look like a flat projection you can see that it's really floating there in three dimensions and in person the image doesn't flicker like it does on camera people don't believe it and then there's this magical moment where they can evolve that's real the display works by a process called acoustic levitation in the walls of this box arrays of speakers producing sound waves so by using the sound creating a standing wave and tiny bead the speaker's create areas of high pressure that can trap a polystyrene bead and suspend it in midair moving the bead around and shining a light on it creates a glowing moving dot move that door around fast enough and you can create shapes in the air what we've created is a Cousteau phoretic volumetric display so we basically use sound to trap a lightweight object in free space and we can update its position at very high update rates so fast that persistence of vision happens and you think it's a full object the team was inspired by research published last year from Brigham Young University the American group had successfully created a volumetric display by steering tiny particles of cellulose using laser light they were trapping a particle with lasers and doing something very similar and for us to be honest we were not even thinking that that could be a possibility you know what we looked at each other I think we can do that I know that's right the team at the University of Sussex has been working on using sound waves to move small objects or create sensations for a few years but the big challenge in creating a volumetric display was to get the beads moving fast enough that it appears as a single non moving image since the other image for human eyes the whole path for example I got if you want to create a circle this circle should be scanned in 100 milliseconds and that so the beads should be moved so fast you could create this path in 100 millisecond but I see that's part the end of it right so because we are updating at that speed we can also create audio and tactile feedback so the object is singing as it's moving because and at the same time if you bring your hand close to it you will get a sensation of touch the researchers can use the same waves of pressure that control the bead to create ripples in the air fluttering on a finger to give a tactile experience that's something that no other kind of volumetric display can do we create that focusing point to another place for tactile feedback so it's like a levitation tactile levitation cocktail so we can switch the quickly play so fast yes we you don't see it when you're watching you don't hear it it has to make you feel like you're getting closer to something something real like batting wings or something and by using the interactions between ultrasound waves the display can even produce audible sound at the moment the display can only create small simple shapes but if the team can get their beads moving even faster or can manipulate multiple beads they could create bigger and more complex images and the team hopes that this could be the start of 3d displays becoming part of everyday life the idea of just 3d content to be something that's there you go you use it whenever you need to use it you don't need to use it you don't or I need to be seeing that 3d content but also my notes or just check what time it is you know like blending the filter content in our real day-to-day life just in a seamless manner it's something that's very valuable this is literally our first step we've got a long way to go but the interesting bit is that the fundamentals that are underpinning this kind of displays they are strong they can really deliver all of this and I think that's very exciting you","6eiErYh_FeY":"artificial intelligence researchers that deepmind have mastered pong chess and go but some games are on another level the game of Starcraft 2 one of the most complicated video games ever created it is a real-time strategy game which means that you don't take turns you play and you have to play fast it was clear that Starcraft would be a great grand challenge for us to tackle using an artificial intelligence the techniques we love namely neural networks deep reinforcement learning and so on so forth my name is Oreo videos and I'm the lead researcher of the Alpha Star project alpha star is an artificial intelligence system that plays the game Starcraft 2 so the first element of StarCraft that's quite different is that you don't get to see what's happening on the other side of the board that it's what we call imperfect information and is a key challenge that neither in chess or NGO are present another key difference is that the pieces of chess or what we call units in StarCraft are created throughout the game right so you start with very very few units and what you're doing is deciding which pieces are you gonna invest in creating next and that's very important because at the same time you must counter pieces or units that the other player is thinking about without having perfect information the first step of alpha star is can you predict where a human is gonna pick what's the most likely mode so essentially alpha star is gathering information from the game where all its units are it's getting all these data into not a program but rather a mathematical entity that is called neural network that is able to then process all this information we never had coded what this processing means this was fully learned from first imitation learning trying to imitate human moves and later on self play through the alpha star League and after these processing many layers of computation of learned behavior at the there is essentially a single action that will be sent back to the game and so this action could be create a new unit create a worker send these worker to scout move the camera to this location and that's essentially what alpha star is every basically 20 milliseconds in the game and every action you see here is a result of computation using this neural network by January 2019 alpha star was able to beat two professional players under special test conditions but people wanted to see if it could reach the Grandmaster level beating the best players at the full game what's quite critical is that humans are very creative at playing this game so once we went online with this agent we faced all sorts of creative strategies that we could not possibly have ourselves designed so the very first game that we entered we were playing against obviously someone we don't know so it really was like a lot of adrenaline and a great moment to let people essentially experience what it is to play against such a strong AI alpha star progressed by playing against itself against a range of human players and crucially by playing against other AI agents we have this league of agents where all the agents are doing safe play in a manner that is perhaps a bit more advanced than what has been done before and there we did perhaps the most research advances in the last few months in which we discovered that it's not sufficient to have only one agent that its sole purpose is to beat itself and it's past versions of itself it's very important to add agents that find flaws in the main agents right so we call these agents exploiter agents and if you will it's kind of asking for a friend to beat your current strategy and maybe this strategy that is going to beat you is not a great strategy in isolation but it's certainly gonna help you become a better player and that core idea plus them some extra developments in imitation learning and reinforcement learning that we had in the project created an artificial intelligence agent that can play the game of starcraft 2 at a Grand Master level actually I used to play the game back the 90s I played quite seriously the first version of the game one of the sad things that happened is that I kind of waited too long to play against alpha star so the team was really are like Oriole you should play at some point I decided okay I'll play against the agent I played when it was just strong enough that there was no chance for me to win and I just basically lost the window for me to kind of defeat the agent sadly so victory not for me alpha star is broken into the top 200 players in Europe and Starcraft 2 playing the full version of the game with all three alien races we are here not trying to solve Starcraft we're trying to utilize a Starcraft for the purpose of advancing AI research but be applied to any domain that utilizes artificial intelligence in any of its components and enhance for instance its robustness its capabilities to do imitation learning from experts and other things that we deem super important and that Starcraft really let us test on one of the most complicated video games ever created success in the real world is a little more complicated computer games can readily provide the data points and AI needs to master a challenge but not every problem provides so much accurate feedback the integration of AI into everyday life will be a much longer battle you [Music]","-Fz3JlGABrs":"for decades people have been fascinated by creatures of the past what did they look like how did they move many theories have been developed for many species now researchers have turned their attention to an ancient creature called or Abati's which lived before the dinosaurs roamed the earth using cutting-edge techniques from computer modeling to robotics they think they've worked out how it moved bringing a fossil back to life [Music] or Abati's lived around 280 million years ago it was a time when vertebrates were still quite new to walking on land but its skeleton has been exquisitely preserved to work out how it might have moved researchers scanned the fossil in three dimensions and used this to construct a digital model of the or Abati's skeleton this model could then be animated sort of like a digital marionette the marionette helped them work out the range of motion for each joint telling them how far or Abati's could bend or stretch but it's unlikely that or Abati's wall using its full range of motion in every joint so they needed to narrow it down a bit one way to do that is to look at another fossil not of our bodies itself but of its tracks this fossil shows where an ore Abati's specimen placed its feet long ago as it rambled across the ground programming the skeleton marionette to walk inside the fossilized footsteps narrowed down its movement further but there are still many options for how an ore Abati's could have made the footprints to narrow it down more researchers turn to living animals the layout of or Abati's skeleton suggests it would have had a sprawling gait like modern-day lizards or salamanders so researchers used x-ray video to film for such creatures these data helped them identify four key parameters which define sprawling movement power balance precision and something called ground reactive force these four parameters were used as the basis for a dynamic simulation containing the skeleton marionette and the footprints as the weighting of these four traits is adjusted the simulation spits out graphs containing all the possible movement combinations which fit the bill then the researchers could pick through all the outputs to find the most likely options but there's still a catch computer simulations can't account for everything like the complexities of gravity there are so many variables that it's really hard to model them all in detail so researchers went one step further to validate their predictions in the real world they built a robot this scale sized robot was also modeled and added to the dynamic simulation bringing with it more physical constraints narrowing down the options and combining all of these different approaches they settled on an answer the researchers think the ORA Barty's moved with a relatively upright gait and had more advanced capabilities than expected for such an early land dweller and that hints at a different ecology a more mobile animal may have been more adept at picking through the landscape and perhaps be able to travel further from water than scientists had predicted the researchers hope that some of their methods could help reverse engineer the movement of other fossilized animals and they've made their model available for free

more flexible in a single large creature would be the same can be said of the micro swarm it's strong enough to manipulate small objects but flexible enough to fit through narrow spaces this technology may have medical applications perhaps delivering drugs around the body or acting as a contrast agent for x-rays or ultrasound scans but although this micro storm is pretty good at getting

researchers in the States who hoped that one day it could help in the fight against cancer [Music] to give you a sense of just how small this nano cage is let's start with a single grain of salt it's around 300 microns wide compare that to say a red blood cell that's it there now compare the red blood cell to something much smaller like this the HIV virus the silicon nano cage is a bit more than ten times smaller than that to make it researchers use a relatively simple technique first they need a template for that they use soap molecules when in solution the soap molecules form tiny balls called micelles the size of the micelles is precisely controlled by the researchers then they add a silica precursor to the mix gradually the negatively charged silica precursors are attracted to the positively charged micelle template over time they build up forming the structure the template could then be washed or burned out which would leave a perfect dodecahedral cage what's more this process happens without any intervention it's self assembling this is how the researchers think that the cages form but until recently they didn't even know they existed they're so small it's nearly impossible to snap a picture of them to get that glimpse of the nanocages researchers used cryo-electron microscopy they put their sample on a tiny disc and plunge it into liquid nitrogen flash freezing it then they can use an electron microscope to take a peak making images that look a bit like this they repeated the process over and over to gather nearly 20,000 images of the fuzzy looking cages all lying in slightly different positions at different angles and orientations now here's the clever bit a computer can analyze and average out all the different images of all the different orientations of the structure so feed them into a computer and an algorithm can reconstruct a 3d representation and what popped out was a perfect dodecahedron only 11 nanometers across studies have shown that ultra-small silica particles can easily and safely pass through the body being excreted in the urine rather than getting stuck in the liver which can cause side effects perhaps nanocages

so far many of these materials transform relatively slowly sometimes they need to be connected to a controller with wires or tubes or they have a limited range of movements now scientists have developed a flexible smart material that is remotely activated can move in multiple ways and can transform quickly changing its shape completely in less than a second this material can be 3d printed and scientists use magnets to change its shape the technique uses a soft silicon rubber embedded with tiny particles of iron a magnetic field is used to magnetize a substance creating a magnetic material that can be printed into any shape and the direction of the magnetic field can be changed during printing the result is a material with a non uniform polarity meaning each part of the structure can respond differently to a magnetic charge scientists added a red filter to film the movements the system is so precise that researchers can program a computer model to move in a certain way print it out and the same movement can be replicated exactly in the physical structure the team have already made shapes that can contract deform stop a ball catch a ball and even jump but there are countless more possibilities if it can be modeled it can be made because the magnetic field is applied remotely these materials can be used in small inaccessible places in medicine this could be

one of the most shocking talents in the animal kingdom literally used to sense an attack prey the electric eels ability to generate store and release jolts from within its body has fascinated scientists for centuries and now they're mimicking it on a quest to create a flexible bio battery which could power all kinds of futuristic tech to wear on our bodies and even inside our bodies to make an electric eel inspired battery the first thing to understand is how the Eels do it enter specialized cells called electrocytes these cells have membranes that allow certain charged ions to pass through leaving the cell in a neutral state when it's resting when the eel is ready to strike channels on one side of the cell open and positive ions rush in generating a current and zap it's curtains for the unsuspecting prey each electro site only produces around 150 millivolts but large eels can have thousands of them packed together like a battery using some clever nervous system timing they're able to activate them all simultaneously making for a hefty shock scientists based at the University of Freiburg in Switzerland took inspiration from this process to create an artificial electric organ they used blobs of hydrogel to mimic each part of the electro site yellow and green blobs act as the selectively permeable membranes red and blue blobs contain different levels of the ions just like the eel ions rush across these membranes to generate a current each group of four blobs can produce about the same voltage as an electric eels electro site also like the eel scientists wanted to stack their artificial cells up to increase the voltage but how do you do that one answer printing when laid on top of each other these two sheets laden with hydrogel blobs form one long line of repeating units enough to generate about a hundred volts now there's one more thing the eel fires all of its electro sites simultaneously to get maximum voltage and the scientists need to do the same to get that high voltage all of the gels need to contact at the same time the sheets made it faster but for truly simultaneous connections the researchers came up with another idea folding this allowed all the bio gel blobs to touch each other almost simultaneously the eel can recharge its battery by illogically within its body whereas right now the artificial battery needs to be connected up to a power source researchers want to use their battery to power things like contact lenses with integrated displays or biological sensors or even wearable tech so the hope is that their battery to will one day be recharged biologically after all if the eel can do it why can't we right you","ksQPYjLEKYk":"if you'd asked me 10 years ago when I started my lab that I'll be you know I have a one-kilometer tano and recording from I call it whole colony of bats I'll tell you you're nuts I'm studying the hippocampal formation set of brain areas that have to do with learning and memory and I'm studying close brain areas in somewhat unusual animal models in bass [Music] that's I think they are very cute the bats that we worked with the Egyptian fruit bats have these interesting behaviors if we try to utilize and that give advantages over the standard animal models which are mice and rats so for example if we want to add to ask questions about how 3d space we dimensional spaces representing the brain bats are flying mammals so obviously they're good choice for that we can also another advantage is that bats have two distal sensory systems vision and a colocation we can a trade-off these two senses and ask how the same spaces are presented under these two these two systems which are difficult to do in rats or mice we also have questions about how very large spaces are represented in the brain so we've built this long tunnel 200 meter long and we are building this year and even longer tunnel almost 1 kilometer long and we have bats flying there you know 100 120 times back and forth while we record neurons in their brain and we see you know very different representation in this enormous space [Music] so we implant these small electrodes in the bath that allow us to record the activity of single neurons in those brain areas and we have developed the small wireless sector physiology devices called neuro loggers that are really small and sit on top of the animal which allow us to record wirelessly in a bat as its flying around and then we can have them fly in a large flight room or in various learning large-scale spaces that we would have built and studied their representation of space we can also have that interacting and ask more social questions on the bat but I'm really interested in is the neural basis of natural behaviors you know neuroscience have traditionally focused on either of course anesthetized animals and was it don't behave at all or if they're you know doing behaviors they're doing highly controlled behaviors you know lever pressing or nose poking in some very you know 30 centimeter size box the big plus size of side of it is it is highly controlled so you can get very repeated very controlled experiment the minus side of it is it's very far removed from natural behavior from what the brain evolved to actually do outdoors and so I really believe in addition to having those highly controlled experiments we should ideally record the same neurons or at least from the same brain areas from an animal behavior in a more natural situation now that the technology allows it that we have technology for wireless sector physiology for recording for freely moving animals you know from Wireless optogenetics camera arrays with microphone with movement sensors also the devices were not available until few years

temperature from there and what happens in the tropics is rather than there being sort of a global warming and so you get the pattern but everything cranks up a bit you you end up with the maximum temperatures not really increasing very much but everywhere else catching up with those maximum temperatures and so you end up with sort of a vast moon when you move from a flatter sea surface temperature gradient encompassing the whole of the Pacific and the Indian Oceans to something happening more like today then actually you're seeing large changes in rainfall both both locally and elsewhere in the world so over the over East Africa for example and it has been suggested that those changes in rainfall over East Africa could have been an important factor in driving human evolution having found this this world in the past that's sort of a uniform thing that we don't really understand why it happened that would be sort of academic if if it were not for other factors that were important back then and so those other factors are the fact that we're looking at a warm world and with a carbon dioxide level similar to what we're breathing today and it was a very long situation - it was a steady state of that world and so in some respects that bears similarities to the future and and until we know the reason for the discrepancy between our explanations and the data I'm worried that we can't discount a possible future there has a vast pool of warm water covering the tropics and the nasty changes in the atmospheric circulation and rainfall changes that would go along with that but it could just be in some respects that we've that our image of the past is wrong that we've synthesized in this paper I'd like to think it's not but it could be that it's wrong or it could be that we're that by assuming it's a similar condition to the future world actually that's wrong and there's some critical factor that we haven't yet discovered and in general message is that we know enough to do something about what's what's going on we know we know that its greenhouse gases are causing a climate or a changing climate and we know that if we don't emit as many greenhouse gases we have a less changing climate and so from that standpoint yes there's an uncertainty on exactly what the temperature change would be but it doesn't change the fundamentals that that more greenhouse gases means or climate change and so we know enough to act on that now the major uncertainty in the century scale climate projections is how much greenhouse gases and other forcings humans are actually going to emit we're now developing sufficient science to be able to provide a probability forecast and say okay well if you if you're worried about a 1% exceedance then you need to build your flood protection this high there's that we're now exploiting that uncertainty to provide extra information you","F3oohJu3mJY":"[Music] it's been 150 years since the first edition of nature was published in 1869 in that time the science contained inside the journal has changed a lot but so has the front cover I'm Kelly Krause creative director of nature and I've come to the nature archives to discover some front covers from nature's long history and to see how the design of the magazine has changed over the years Wow right well we have all the nature right from the first issue on the 4th of November 1869 when I talked to the present-day so I'm interested in looking at the covers over time and how they've changed from being mostly advertisements on the cover to being very rich with imagery part of my job at nature is to design the cover each week but when the journal first started the front cover was completely different to anything we do today in fact for nearly 100 years the front page was just used for advertising you've got this which is more like announcement events then you'll get the instruments that come on the front this is one of my favorite covers from this era an advertisement for buying Rock and fossil collections and there's one here for a sunshine recorder it really shows how for a long time science was in many ways a hobby or a gentleman's pursuit looking through the archived volumes we eventually found some covers with actual science on them but not until the 1960s and even then it was still only text at that point it wasn't until a few years later that we started seeing figures and black-and-white photography it's so interesting that in this cover in 1967 the only hint content is this the text here this is a structure of Jupiter and then by 1974 we finally moved to actually visualizing the content as the main events on the cover finally as we flick through the books we started seeing not just black and white but full-color images filling the pages and they particularly appreciated the very of their time gradients that the popular so this is in the mid-80s when gradients are really just kind of starting in a gradients cutouts these covers were still being physically put together with tape sir before desktop publishing all of these designs had to be made on paper photos were cut out and pasted down-- ingredients were made by airbrushing with paint after being taped together the final cover was essentially photographed and the photograph sent to print by the 90s Nature had embraced desktop publishing doing most of the work on computers using software like Photoshop there's a lot more stuff you can do with an image once it's digital although some tweaks are a little more obvious in hindsight and this is a classic from the beginning of the desktop publishing era and this one is one of my particular favorites because it shows a bit of photoshop malfeasance this is in 1997 and this is Dolly the sheep and this cover is amazing because it really speaks volumes about the era in which it was made if you look closely dolly you'll see that this foot here it looks a bit strange and the reason is is because that's actually not Dolly's foot at all this was cut out in Photoshop and if you look at the original picture you'll see that it's Dolly's mother standing behind it became fashionable to do these sort of cutouts that were more intricate than can be done in pasted up so in this she has a foot that's not her own which is fantastic when I joined nature I was given the opportunity to refine the cover design for the modern digital era this meant aligning our print and web design but also as nature's first creative director making sure that all covers were evaluated for their artistic merit as well as the scientific value of the research they showed I started at Nature in 2011 so I'm just looking at some things from that era and they've landed on actually one of my favorite covers from the very beginning when I started which is looking at insect wings I remember the authors of the paper submitted about 20 different insects and this particular one caught my eye because it was so unusual I think it is a beautiful photograph but it also says a lot about the era you know it's still a Photoshop cutout but it's meant to look much more natural like it's in a studio it's meant to give you the sense that you're just looking at the object without any decoration really what they don't yet have here in the archives of course is our latest cover for nature is one hundred and fiftieth anniversary we've collaborated with a team of network scientists to produce a graphic representation of almost every paper in Nature has published since 1900 and I think it's pretty amazing having visited the archives and seen the bound volumes of these papers to then see them represented like this on the cover and this cover isn't just a static image we have also made a video to show the links between some of the most important papers in nature's history and an interactive experience so anyone can look through the model and navigate their own way between different points so this is much more than just a print cover I think it's a great way to mark our anniversary but perhaps in a hundred and fifty years some future creative director of nature will be here in the archives looking over our interactive cover and commenting on how it's very retro and representative of its time [Music]","Fv4UfH6bJ-A":"this is the head of the World Health Organization dr. Ted Rose a de nom de Asis earlier this year he deemed me on Twitter he said I should come to the DRC and see for myself how complicated Ebola was to control there a few months later I was flying to the eastern DRC one of the first things I noticed once I landed was the presence of tanks and soldiers there's been decades of conflict in the area and war and political instability are really at the root of why abullah has been so hard to contain this is a photo outside of an Ebola center there's soldiers stationed behind sandbags at the entrance the reason they're there is that this particular Ebola Center had already been attacked twice had been burnt to the ground but at the same time the presence of soldiers might be intimidating for some people and that's on top of the fact that a bola is a terrifying disease and then the response to Ebola is also strange and terrifying someone in this household was diagnosed with Ebola and now there is these a bola responders dressed in these weird white Tyvek suits who come in and just douse all of somebody's belongings in chlorine some people have even set up chairs to watch the whole scene but the care being offered to people is improving compared to previous outbreaks here's within Ana bullet treatment center and there's a plastic cube around a patient that allows family members to see in and patients to see out in addition this time there's not only intravenous fluids that are given to every patient but people are getting experimental Ebola drugs and two of those a bola drugs have now been proven to be up to 90% effective if people get them early and the other bright spot is that there's now an Ebola vaccine that's been widely deployed in this outbreak for the first time so you would think that this outbreak would be contained by now but it's not and there's a few reasons for that one of them is that it's difficult to know who is at high risk also vaccine teams can't vaccinate people who don't want to be vaccinated and people aren't getting experimental drugs if they don't go into a bullet centers what they'll do first is go to the places they're used to going so that could be a pasture it could be a traditional healer it could be a small pharmacy or a small clinic these sort of pharmacies are just all over the place there's hundreds of them you can see like a snake around a chalice that's sort of an insignia this is a photo inside of one of these health facilities this woman is feverish and rather than have her mix with all of the other patients that might show up there they've decided to put patients who have symptoms of Ebola in one area so that they're separated from others so in this room a mother's sitting by her child and the doctor thinks the child should perhaps go to an abolish treatment center but the mother doesn't want her child to go and if you can put yourself in the mother's shoes the Ebola centers about an hour away she'd have to be separated she can't hold her child you can't be there next to him this is the kind of mistrust or reluctance that comes from a place of love and concern and not conflict this is a photo of an Ebola checkpoint these are set up to contain the outbreak what happens is when people go past they have their temperature taken and if they have a fever they're not allowed to travel through a checkpoint and these checkpoints have been very helpful but at the same time they're not bulletproof people with Ebola have now traveled to Goma in North Kivu which is a very international City and they've now traveled 700 kilometers south what all of this comes down to is that dr. Ted Rose has a huge amount of work in front of him the world has completely ignored a humanitarian crisis in the DRC for a quarter century that crisis is why the Ebola outbreak has now killed more than 2,000 people and if we keep ignoring a bola - it's only going to help the virus spread [Music]","YNGBIC1zq8c":"this is let us all the first image I said no wow like you read about them in our scientific life we're looking this the mystery of nature that has never uncovered your answer so this is it with finally seen it scientists came up with this crazy idea in the 1930s and they never imagined that one day we would actually see a black hole it's so far only a few blurry splotches of light and yet they contain so much information about the physics of the universe I've been dreaming about this for 25 years when I fought saw the first data it was just some weird plot it looked like there could be a ring in there I was like oh my god this is gonna be interesting it looks pretty much what we were expecting which was for a theoretician is always an you know a dramatic moment when you have to compare what you spent years simulating with what actually nature is telling you this is just like kind of the beginning of being able to have another window into what black holes can tell us about our laws and in physics but already we've learned so much so you know we didn't know even though we had predicted that if you had a black hole that you would see this ring of light we didn't know we were gonna get that ring away and that's you know what we were kind of testing we could have gone in just a blob and so seeing that ring and seeing a ring that has a size that is consistent with other measurements that can hadn't been done completely differently I think that in itself just being able to see that ring of life being able to see that that ring exists is huge we are also releasing this data that has from the event horizon telescope that were used to create this image so whoever out there has a you know alternative theory of gravity can just grab this data and test it well the big goal still is to make an image of the black hole in the of our Milky Way because it has a much better determine mass and so we can do much better tests of general relativity and we can also have other telescopes look at it their infrared interferometers we can see gas going around it so combining all these information will give us a much better image of how black holes actually work the picture we have seen today is only a first taste of what the event horizon telescope and delivered already the data they have in the back can produce a lot more information for example about what produces the Jets these enormous beams of light that we see coming out of the galaxy m87 also the team has collected a lot of data about another black hole the one at the center of our own galaxy and they haven't even started analyzing so stay tuned there's a lot more to come you","xrIjFVMliOQ":"[Music] amyotrophic lateral sclerosis shortened to ALS is a neurodegenerative disease which usually begins in adulthood and advances rapidly it's characterized by the deterioration and loss of both upper and lower motor neurons as the motor neurons stop sending signals the muscles weaken leading to paralysis when the muscles in the diaphragm are paralyzed this can be fatal there is no known cure for ALS for most people the cause of their LS is unknown but some people inherit the disease from their parents by studying the genes that are altered in these patients scientists have pinpointed processes in the neurons that might be causing ALS it's too early to know which of these altered processes are a result of the disease and which could be a cause but it's clear that they affect many different aspects of the motor neuron function let's start in the cell body here proteins that are not transported into the nucleus build up in the cytoplasm errors in the systems that build up and break down proteins also cause other misfolded proteins to accumulate the different proteins can then aggregate and can become toxic to cells in several ways for example they can damage mitochondria the cell's power generators mitochondrial damage can lead to oxidative stress which can trigger breaks in the DNA of the cell ALS seems to affect DNA repair processes as well when DNA breaks are poorly repaired it ultimately contributes to the death of the neuron the cells transport machinery can also be damaged for example ALS affected neurons often have problems transporting RNA proteins and vesicles both in the cytoplasm and along the neurons axon these vesicles containing pourtant cell signaling molecules called neurotransmitters if these can't be moved along the axon or released the neuron can't send messages to its target cells damage to the cytoskeleton can also cause the axon to retract if this happens the axon can no longer connect to the muscle nearby and can no longer signal the muscle to contract other cell types can also be involved in ALS oligodendrocytes which electrically insulate the axon and provide support to the motor neuron don't work in people with ALS reduced uptake of neurotransmitters by astrocytes can lead to over activation of the receptors at the synapse and death of the neuron finally astrocytes and microglia can produce factors that protect or damaged motor neurons neuronal death occurs when excessive damaging factors are produced further research is needed to find out which of these many processes caused the motor neuron degeneration seen in ALS patients targeting new drug therapies at those processes might lead to a treatment for this incurable disease [Music]","Yy8e4sw70ow":"[Music] [Laughter] mood naturally fluctuates and everyone experiences highs and lows in their lives but in some cases changes in mood can become long-lasting debilitating and can impair someone's ability to hold down a job or sustain meaningful relationships it's estimated that around 10 percent of people will at some point in their lives suffer from depression a mood disorder characterized by several symptoms feeling sad distressed unmotivated excessively tired and losing interest in once pleasurable activities known as anhedonia many people with depression also suffer from anxiety neuroimaging studies reveal that many brain circuits that normally regulate mood are dysregulated in depression located deep within the brain the amygdala processes highly salient stimuli such as rewards and potential threats in depression the amygdala is overactive and responds excessively to negative events in turn the amygdala connects to a set of brain regions that hone the physiological and behavioral response to emotional stimuli these areas include the medial prefrontal cortex the nucleus accumbens the hippocampus and the insula the hippocampus is involved in memory formation and along with the prefrontal cortex is particularly vulnerable to the effects of stress depressed people are more susceptible to stress which can cause physical changes in the brain including atrophy of the hippocampus this and other changes in depressed people may cause inappropriate responses to emotional events the medial prefrontal cortex is involved in regulating how strongly we react to emotional stimuli treatments such as antidepressant drugs cognitive behavioral therapy and electroconvulsive therapy affect the structure and function of these and other brain regions animal models such as mice are critical in helping us understand the cellular and molecular changes underlying depression and develop better treatments although it's impossible to know if a mouse is depressed my subjected to chronic stress show some symptoms similar to depressed humans such as anxiety like behavior less social interaction and a lack of interest in normally pleasurable activities while not all human depression is triggered by stress these models may still shed light on the biology of depression and they're the closest scientists can get while studying mice as with humans chronic stress in mice can lead to atrophy of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex Mouse studies have also shown altered neuronal plasticity in various brain regions including the hippocampus prefrontal cortex amygdala and nucleus accumbens in a healthy hippocampus experiences can lead to changes in the connections between neurons resulting in learning these changes are referred to as plasticity chronic stress can reduce this plasticity healthy brains also continue to produce new neurons in one part of the hippocampus these new neurons slowly mature and integrate into the circuitry where they have a strong effect on hippocampal activity and behavior these new neurons are also affected by stress they reduced in number in stressed brains these effects may result from reduced levels of neurotrophins proteins that increase neuronal growth and plasticity reduced plasticity may stop the hippocampus from being able to properly regulate the stress response which may lead to a vicious cycle where stress perpetuates more stress the hippocampus is particularly affected but there can be reductions in plasticity elsewhere in the brain and together these changes could contribute to other symptoms of depression like an dona whether these cellular changes seen in mice are involved in human depression remains unclear most antidepressants available today rapidly increase the amount of the neurotransmitters serotonin and\/or norepinephrine in the synapse however improvements in symptoms in patients and mice usually don't occur until weeks after starting the treatment while the reasons for this delay aren't fully understood prolonged treatment with antidepressants can over time act to reverse some of the changes induced by chronic stress increasing neurotrophins expression and rebooting hippocampal plasticity non-chemical treatments for depression including electroconvulsive shock also promote hippocampal plasticity in mice antidepressant treatment can also reverse stress induced changes in other areas of the brain including the prefrontal cortex and reward circuitry different treatments may target different regions to improve symptoms recently the drug ketamine was found to have rapid antidepressant effects in patients with depression as well as in rodent models with effects lasting for days the mechanism behind this is an area of active research ketamine blocks a type of synaptic transmission leading to activation of a number of signaling pathways an increasing neurotrophins expression these molecular changes result in increased plasticity in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and likely contribute to ketamine's behavioural effects by studying the changes in the brain caused by chronic stress and how antidepressants like ketamine work to reverse them researchers may find new targets for treatment or new drugs that could act more quickly more specifically or more effectively than currently available treatments [Laughter] [Music] [Music]","jqdOkXQngw8":"how many trees are there in a forest what about a country how about in the whole world the answer we now know is that our planet is home to three point zero four trillion trees that's actually almost 8 times more than we thought as previous estimates were only based on satellite pictures but now we have data not just on how much land is covered in forest but how dense those forests are as well measurements were collected by thousands of people out counting trees in forests all over the world the average density of trees at each location is represented by the height of the green lines some of the densest areas of these subarctic forests where you can find a tree every square meter but almost half of all our trees are found growing in the vast tropical and subtropical forests all this data is going to help our understanding of where endangered species might be able to live how water is cycled in an ecosystem or how much carbon dioxide is being absorbed from the atmosphere it also helps us work out what we ought to be doing to preserve and replenish our planet's forests because even accounting for new growth we're currently losing about 10 million trees a year at the moment there are about 400 trees for every person on earth but they're disappearing at a rate of one point four trees per person every single year if we keep going at this rate a walk in the woods will soon become a lot trickier thousands of years ago before human civilization took hold the earth had almost twice as many trees as it does now most of Europe for example was one big forest groups all over the world are working on planting trees and restoring natural habitats this new data will make their targets more accurate and it will certainly change our fundamental understanding of our planet we now know we

puppetry particular hands I find it quite different from the other forms of puppetry because you're literally embodying something puppets aren't really thought of as being scientific even though there are people who approach it quite scientifically and study patterns of movement and things like that but I think it's often thought of as children's when nature first contacted us I I think I felt surprised and then it meet immediately kind of excited I really like it when science and the arts combined because at school I felt like you either had to choose to go down the scientific paths or the artistic part so when you get options to get a little bit more involved with science through the arts it's really satisfying and hopefully vice versa with people from nature who are collaborating with

force hurricanes scientists have long known that shallow reefs are vulnerable to hurricanes with corals torn apart as the winds stir on the scene but the reefs of The Twilight Zone have been assumed to be protected from the worst effects these deeper reefs have also been thought to provide a temporary refuge for shallow reef species which could shelter in the deeper water but new research is telling a different story scientists in Puerto Rico have been studying reefs both before and after Hurricane Maria a particularly violent storm they've already shown that the hurricane caused currents and upwellings deep into the twilight zone next they plan to assess damage to the deeper corals directly in Maria's path the deep reaching effects of strong hurricanes would be bad news for species on the hunt for somewhere to weather the storm of course coral reefs have been surviving hurricanes for millennia but extreme weather events are getting more common as the climate changes human activity is also causing ocean acidification and warming this can lead to diseases in coral bleaching and recent research suggests that deeper reefs could be just as vulnerable as shallow ones coral reefs provide coastlines with a line of defense against storms so losing this delicate resource could add yet more pressure to regions already devastated by the effects of climate change [Music]","fLlr-4IU7d4":"this island in the Indian Ocean supports the riving seabird colonies and rich coral reefs but nearby other islands are eerily silent the cause of this difference lies in a complex web of birds rats coral and poop the Chagos archipelago in the Indian Ocean is home to over 60 tropical islands nearly a third of which are completely free from invasive species like rats or foxes this safe haven for birds creates quite the cacophony brother rat free Island [Music] [Music] on neighboring islands however the arrival of sailing ships in the 1800s brought an unwanted visitor rats the rodents prayers like wealth rodents they devoured seabird eggs and chicks until they all but wiped out the bird populations in contrast to this island where there's rats and there's very very few seabirds the skies are empty and it's very quiet but the story doesn't stop there because the birds play a critical role in the wider ecosystem all thanks to their poop now these birds return to the islands when they roost and they breathe huge mats wallow or bird poo come to the islands and this swallow is highly rich in nitrogen so they're effectively fertilizing the islands this nitrogen is great for plants which thrive on the rat-free islands but scientists wondered whether this aerial nitrogen delivery system was also impacting the surrounding coral reefs instead of feeding on the algae out from the reef crest we were able to look at their growth rates the team found that rat-free islands had two-and-a-half times more nitrogen across the entire ecosystem and fish living on the nearby reefs grew faster and bigger than those around rat-infested islands these fish graze on algae that otherwise covers the coral slowing its growth the scientists observed three times more grazing on the reefs surrounding rat-free islands these healthier reefs may be more resilient to climate change when it comes to interwove and ecosystems like those of the che cose archipelago it seems invasive species like rats have a bigger impact than we thought so the erupting oceanic Islands should really be a very high priority for conservation it's not difficult to deer up these islands and it would have a huge of the trusted environment and adjacent rate environments the team is now urging governments to consider investing in rat extermination programs as a way to save coral reefs this unusual solution could be a quick and cost effective tool in the fight against coral decline all due to a complex chain linking rats birds fish coral and poop [Music]","JsypVU8VkS4":"it's a tough gig being a pollinator these days especially in big cities land is being used differently and that's a threat to pollinating insects but a new study of four UK cities shows that increasing urbanization doesn't have to be a death sentence a team of ecologists looked at nine types of land-use that make up most of a city's area if you exclude buildings roads and water which aren't much used to pollinators anyway first they counted the total number of pollinators and plants in each area recording how many different species there were as well the more numerous and varied the plants the greater the biodiversity of pollinators no surprises there gardens held the most and most varied pollinating insects but not all garden plants are equally appealing hydrangeas daisies and forget-me-nots were less appetizing whereas among pollinators favorite flowers where dandelions brambles and buttercups ones that gardeners often pull up next the researchers wanted to know how land could be better managed to support pollinator communities so they built a computer model to test how giving more land to each different land use might make pollinator networks more robust in other words more resilient to species loss they found that the biggest bounce in robustness came when they allotted more space to allotments even though with the boost allotments still only accounted for less than 1% of City space allotments host fruits vegetables and weeds as well a mix which provides a great variety of flowers the researchers also wondered if there were other ways to boost the robustness of pollinator communities according to their model this could be achieved by planting more flowers in parks and allowing wildflowers to grow in verges and other green spaces a few simple strategies see the researchers could help support pollinators in cities across the world add more allotments plant flowers in parks and don't know that grass [Music]","nIQWpsyoeoo":"this is the story of an evolutionary trap a trap laid by people but which led to the demise of thousands of butterflies what went wrong and can we stop it happening again we start in a meadow in Nevada with the Edith's Checkerspot butterfly like many butterflies the Edith's Checkerspot has favorite plants on which to lay its eggs in this meadow the butterflies first choice is called the blue I'd marry the butterflies lay their eggs in the spring a fortnight later they hatch and the ravenous caterpillars feed for two weeks before the plant starts to die back and the caterpillars enter a dormant state next spring when the blue-eyed marries regrow the caterpillars wake up gorged themselves and build a cocoon [Music] then they finally emerge as a butterfly [Music] this cycle has been going on for generations until humans brought in cattle and with the cows came an invasive plant called ribert plantain the plantain doesn't die back in the summer like the blue-eyed Mary so caterpillars which hatch on the plantain have longer to eat before entering their dormant state helping more of them survive to adulthood what's more a mother butterfly with a preference for plantain is likely to pass that preference on to her caterpillars the evolutionary trap was set gradually the whole population of butterflies became dependent on the plantain abandoning the blue eyed Mary entirely the butterflies did well for a while until in 2005 the cattle ranchers moved out without the cows grass quickly grew engulfing the plantain and hiding it from the butterflies without the plantain to lay their eggs on the butterflies were done for they couldn't adapt fast enough to switch back to the blue eyed Mary within a year they all died for 4 years there were no more Edith's Checkerspot sin the meadow but that wasn't the end luckily butterflies from other Meadows which never abandoned the blue-eyed Mary moved in and the population is now recovering this is the first time that this kind of evolutionary trap has been recorded and around the world more traps like it could already be set waiting to go off conservationists normally look for problems when humans arrive but this trap was sprung and people left it's important to remember that humans make changes quickly but evolution needs longer to react and the researchers hope that the tail of the Edith's Checkerspot will act as a warning you"},"manual_text":{"0RxitCeuokI":"This is the first direct image ever taken of a black hole, courtesy of the Event Horizon Telescope. Creating this image required more data than any other scientific experiment in history. So how did they do it? Up until now most measurements of black holes were indirect, like this time lapse of stars at the centre of our galaxy. The stars seem to be orbiting around something... something with a humongous gravitational pull. Scientists predicted that thing was a black hole. Astronomers have also seen massive jets of matter emanating from the centres of galaxies, sometimes much larger than the galaxies themselves. They predict that the only thing powerful enough to create them would be black holes. The gravitational waves detected by LIGO in 2015 were the most direct and compelling evidence for black holes to date. But detecting gravitational waves is sort of like hearing a black hole. Scientists still wanted to see it. But how do you take a picture of a black object against a black background? The answer: back light it. Matter should emit radiation as it heats up while circling the edge of a black hole, the event horizon. With a big enough telescope scientists should be able to use that radiation as a backdrop to see the silhouette of the black hole itself. But it's tricky. Even though the black hole is gigantic and has galactic scale impacts, it is so far away, to get an image of high enough resolution, scientists calculated they'd need a telescope the size of the Earth, which is obviously impossible. Enter the Event Horizon Telescope, which is not in fact one telescope, but a network of eight observatories spread around the world from Hawaii to Antarctica. Each observatory provides a tiny piece of the puzzle. Take repeated readings as the Earth spins, and you can capture more angles from each telescope. Once you have enough pieces of the puzzle, algorithms can fill in the gaps and build up the whole picture. This process is called interferometry. The observations used to create this image were made over a few nights in 2017. Each night each observatory gathered the same amount of data as the Large Hadron Collider does in a year and it has taken two years to piece it all together. With this image, we can see a black hole for the first time. But it's much more than images. It provides precise tests of the predictions of general relativity. And what's more, beyond the event horizon is a place where physics as we know it no longer works. This is the first direct image ever taken of a black hole but coded in its pixels could be the answers to questions about the whole universe.","QrnfIYFyFDY":"Stephen Hawking was \none of the most influential scientists \nof his generation. From black holes to The Simpsons, his impact on science and popular \nculture is hard to overestimate. In this video we're going to look at just \nthree publications that shaped his career. Number one: 'The singularities of\ngravitational collapse and cosmology' This paper was published in 1970. It was a time when physicists were still finding some of the implications of general relativity hard to swallow, in particular the possibility of black holes \nand infinitely dense singularities. Hawking and others had already\n shown that singularities should form, at least in an abstract mathematical setting. In fact, in his PhD thesis, Hawking had\nexplored how the universe itself might have originated from a\n singularity at the beginning of time. But in the 1970 paper, Hawking worked \nwith eminent physicist Roger Penrose and showed that general relativity, \neven in the real world, really does predict singularities. Number two: 'Black hole explosions?' As time went on Stephen Hawking's name would \nbecome inextricably linked with black holes. This paper really was called 'Black hole explosions?' \nwith a question mark. He had a knack for grabbing people's attention. It describes what came to be\nknown as Hawking radiation which many physicists \nregard as his most important legacy. Hawking was trying to reconcile two\nseemingly incompatible theories. One was general relativity, which works well for \ndescribing the largest scales in the universe, the other was quantum theory, which\ndescribes the smallest scales. Hawking realised that if you believe both theories, the event horizon of a black hole should emit radiation. He had shown that black holes are not actually black. To this day physicists continue to argue over \nthe implications of Hawking radiation and in particular about whether it erases\ninformation from the universe, which would violate quantum theory. And finally, number three: 'A brief history of time'. This is not a scientific paper \nbut rather a popular science book and it is this book which would catapult Hawking \nfrom prominent scientist to probably the most famous scientist of his time. It gave him a new platform as a science communicator, \na spokesperson and a cultural phenomenon. Ever since people around the world have been\nfascinated by his story, his intellect and his tenacity. Many now know Stephen Hawking \nfor his characteristic synthetic voice, his appearances on television shows or his controversial opinions\non a whole host of issues from AI through to alien life. But behind the pop-culture icon, there\nwas a scientist whose legacy will endure. And as Hawking himself once said: \"I hope I will be remembered for my work on black holes\nand the origin of the Universe not for things like appearing on The Simpsons.\"","gmIImZ8uiOs":"Scientists think they've made the first\nmeasurements from the cosmic dawn the period in the Universe's history when\nthe first stars began to shine. But how can scientists study something that\nhappened more than thirteen and a half billion years ago? Well to understand\nthat you need to start with hydrogen. Hydrogen is a cosmologist's best friend\nthey use it to study everything. You see a quirk of hydrogen is that it can emit\nphotons as it switches between states specifically photons with a wavelength\nat around 21 centimeters. When astronomers point radio telescopes at\nthe sky they see a mess of different radio waves but nestled in there is\nalways that 21 centimeter line. These emissions from hydrogen have helped\nscientists to map the universe. It's how they discovered that we're sitting in a\nhuge spiral-shaped galaxy the Milky Way. But hydrogen isn't just useful for\nstudying the Universe today. Right after the Big Bang the Universe was a dark\nsoup of electrons and protons. The particles soon clumped together as\nhydrogen and after hundreds of millions of years\nhydrogen collected into stars, generating light. Cosmologists call this the\ncosmic dawn. That primordial light is hard to see with a telescope because the\ntiny amounts of light made by the first stars would be extremely faint. So\nscientists have taken a slightly different tack. You see when that light\nwas first created it changed everything including the hydrogen itself crucially\nmaking it able to absorb radiation at its favorite 21 centimeter line. With\nthis in mind rather than look for emission from hydrogen cosmologists have\nlooked instead for its absorption. They turned to the Cosmic Microwave\nBackground the mass of radiation left over from the Big Bang. In theory the\nmoment light hit that early hydrogen it would have started absorbing this\nradiation and that should have left a blip in the CMB.\nAnd that after decades of scouring for evidence from this time and two years of\nverification is what cosmologists have foun. But here's where it gets\ninteresting the signal they found is not at 21\ncentimeters anymore because space itself is expanding that line has stretched\nover time which is handy for us because the amount of stretching the wavelength\nfor light is it now tells us how long the light has traveled and so when those\nstars formed. Finally this allows scientists to put some dates to the\nbeginning of the cosmic dawn but that isn't all. While the time the first stars formed\nseems about right the signal is way bigger than\ncosmologists predicted. A lot more radiation was absorbed from this cosmic\nmicrowave background that makes sense given what we know so far about the\nearly Universe. Something doesn't add up and one tantalizing possibility is that\nwe may be seeing the influence of dark matter. Now this is far from confirmed\nbut if true it would give us a wealth of information about dark matter's\nproperties and where to look for it. So this little blip could not only give us\na snapshot of the first stars, but it could be the key to unlocking one of the\nbiggest mysteries in physics","jswSJznyvDI":"This hanging mass is made entirely of bees. The swarm can hold itself together even when shaken about by the wind. Now a team of scientists have been finding out how. About once a year, colonies of honeybees leave their nests in swarms searching for a new home. Until they find a new site the bees rest in these temporary clusters. The clusters are often found in trees but this one is forming in a lab at Harvard in Massachusetts. little do the bees know they're about to go for a ride. The researchers built this shaking apparatus to investigate how the bee swarm reacts to movement. When shaken from side to side, shearing forces act on the colony, with the bees at the top taking the brunt of it, as they try to hold up everything beneath them. The forces threaten to destabilize the whole colony. So the bees do something clever they spread out. The flatter shape changes the colony's centre of mass, and so it wobbles less reducing the pressure on the bees. It makes sense, imagine you're standing up and you\nfind the ground shaking beneath you instinctively you'd crouch down, same principle. Anyway, what's particularly interesting here is that the forces at play are\nacting on the swarm as a whole, but each bee can't see the shape of the swarm - so how does it know where to go or what to do? To find out researchers tracked\nthe bees on the outside of the swarm. As the colony shook they moved upwards to where the stress is greatest. The researchers modelled this behaviour and found that if all the bees follow the rule - move towards the area of higher stress - the colony flattens out, increasing its stability and so decreasing the average stress on each bee. Great for the colony but individual bees are actively putting \nthemselves under more stress to do it. This kind of altruistic behaviour is not very common in nature except, that is, in eusocial insects like bees and ants which rely on altruism for survival. What's more even though each individual bee\ndoesn't necessarily know what's going on, by simply moving towards an area of higher stress the colony as a whole acts intelligently. This is called emergent intelligence and some scientists think that\nit's through a process like this that individual neurons firing in our brain can collectively come together to make, well us. Talk about a hive mind","jOnxr9Ez_Kc":"To the human eye there appears to be a\nglowing three-dimensional butterfly moving around inside this black box. In\nfact all it is, is a tiny polystyrene bead. Wow, that's really small. Yes, it's like a one millimeter, two millimeter bead. It's suspended and we can move it so\nfast to create a 3D shape. This is a volumetric display. It's an image that\nexists in real 3D space and this latest development in the field is unique in\nthat it uses sound waves not only to create the image but also to add audio\nand tactile sensations. Oh yep you can feel, it's like a really, oh like a kind\nof gentle buzz or breeze. My name's Lizzie Gibney and I've come to the University\nof Sussex in the UK to see that display for myself. The most surprising thing\nabout it is that it doesn't look like a flat projection. You can see that it's\nreally floating there in three dimensions and in person the image\ndoesn't flicker like it does on camera. People don't believe it and then there's\nthis magical moment where they go like \"wow that's real\" The display works by a process\ncalled acoustic levitation. In the walls of this box are arrays of speakers\nproducing sound waves. So by using the ultrasound, creating a standing wave and this small tiny small bead. The speaker's create areas of high pressure that can trap a polystyrene\nbead and suspend it in midair. Moving the bead around and shining a light on it\ncreates a glowing moving dot. Move that dot around fast enough, and you can\ncreate shapes in the air. What we've created is an acoustophoretic\nvolumetric display. So we basically use sound to trap a lightweight object in free space and we can update its position at very high\nupdate rates. So fast that persistence of vision happens and you think it's a full\nobject The team was inspired by research published last year from Brigham Young\nUniversity the American group had successfully created a volumetric\ndisplay by steering tiny particles of cellulose using laser light. They were trapping a particle with lasers and doing something very similar and for us,\nto be honest, we were not even thinking that that could be a possibility you\nknow, but we looked at each other and said like \"You think we can do that?\" or like \"I don't know let's try\" The team at the University of Sussex has been working on using sound waves to\nmove small objects or create sensations for a few years. But the big challenge in\ncreating a volumetric display was to get the beads moving fast enough that it\nappears as a single non moving image. To see as a image for human eyes the\nwhole path for example if you want to create a circle, this circle should be\nscanned in 100 milliseconds, something like that. So the beads should be moved so fast to create this path in 100 milliseconds. But actually that's not the\nend of it right, so because we are updating at that speed we can also\ncreate audio and tactile feedback so the object is singing as it's moving\nand at the same time if you bring your hand close to it you will get a\nsensation of touch. The researchers can use the same waves of pressure that control the bead to create ripples in the air. Fluttering on a finger to give a\ntactile experience that's something that no other kind of volumetric display can\ndo. We create that focusing point to another place for tactile feedback so\nit's like a levitation, tactile, levitation, tactile, so we can switch so\nquickly. But it's so fast, we, you don't see it when you're watching.\nYou don't hear it. It does make you feel like you're\ngetting closer to something. Something real, like batting wings or something. And by using the interactions between ultrasound waves the display can even\nproduce audible sound. \"Five\" \"Four\" \"Three\" \"Two\" \"One\" \"Zero\" At the moment the display can only create small, simple\nshapes. But if the team can get their beads moving even faster, or can\nmanipulate multiple beads they could create bigger and more complex images.\nAnd the team hopes that this could be the start of 3D displays becoming part\nof everyday life. The idea of just 3D content to be\nsomething that's there. You go, you use it whenever you need to use it. You don't\nneed to use it, you don't, or I need to be seeing that 3D content but also my notes\nor just check what time it is, you know. Like blending that content in our\nreal day-to-day life just in a seamless manner it's something that's very\nvaluable. This is literally our first step. We've got a long way to go but the\ninteresting bit is that the fundamentals that are underpinning this kind of\ndisplays they are strong, they can really deliver all of this, and I think that's\nvery exciting.","6eiErYh_FeY":"Artificial intelligence researchers at\nDeepMind have mastered Pong, Chess, and Go but some games are on another level. The game of StarCraft II one of the most complicated video games ever created. It\nis a real-time strategy game which means that you don't take turns you play and\nyou have to play fast. It was clear that StarCraft would be a great grand\nchallenge for us to tackle using an artificial intelligence, the techniques\nwe love namely neural networks, deep reinforcement learning and so on so\nforth. My name is Oriol Vinyals and I'm the lead researcher of the AlphaStar\nproject. AlphaStar is an artificial intelligence system that plays the game StarCraft II. So the first element of StarCraft that's quite different is that\nyou don't get to see what's happening on the other side of the board that is\nwhat we call imperfect information and is a key challenge that neither in Chess\nor Go are present. Another key difference is that the pieces of Chess\nor what we call units in StarCraft are created throughout the game, right, so you\nstart with very very few units and what you're doing is deciding which pieces\nare you gonna invest in creating next. And that's very important because at the\nsame time you must counter pieces or units that the other player is thinking\nabout without having perfect information. The first step of AlphaStar is can you\npredict where a human is gonna click what's the most likely move so\nessentially AlphaStar is gathering information from the game where all its\nunits are it's getting all this data into, not a program, but rather a\nmathematical entity that is called neural network that is able to then\nprocess all this information. We never hard coded what this processing means\nthis was fully learned from, first imitation learning, trying to imitate\nhuman moves and later on self play through the AlphaStar League and after\nthis processing many layers of computation of learned behavior at the top\nthere is essentially a single action that will be sent back to the game, and\nso this action could be create a new unit create a worker, send this worker\nto scout, move the camera to this location and that's essentially what AlphaStar is. Every basically 20 milliseconds in the game and every\naction you see here is a result of computation using this neural network. By January 2019 AlphaStar was able to beat two professional players under special test conditions. But people wanted to see if it could reach the GrandMaster level. Beating the best players at the full game. What's quite critical is that\nhumans are very creative at playing this game so once we went online with this\nagent we faced all sorts of creative strategies that we could not possibly\nhave ourselves designed. So the very first game that we entered we were\nplaying against obviously someone we don't know, so it really was like a lot\nof adrenaline and a great moment to let people essentially experience what it is\nto play against such a strong AI. AlphaStar progressed by playing against\nitself, against a range of human players and crucially by playing against other\nAI agents. We have this league of agents where all the agents are doing self play\nin a manner that is perhaps a bit more advanced than what has been done before\nand there we did perhaps the most research advances in the last few months\nin which we discovered that it's not sufficient to have only one agent that\nits sole purpose is to beat itself and its past versions of itself. It's very\nimportant to add agents that find flaws in the main agents right, so we call\nthese agents exploiter agents and if you will it's kind of asking for a friend to\nbeat your current strategy and maybe this strategy that is going to beat you\nis not a great strategy in isolation but it's certainly gonna help you become a\nbetter player and that core idea plus then some extra developments in\nimitation learning and reinforcement learning that we had in the project\ncreated an artificial intelligence agent that can play the game of StarCraft II at\na GrandMaster level. Actually I used to play the game back\nthe 90s I played quite seriously the first version of the game one of the sad\nthings that happened is that I kind of waited too long to play against AlphaStar.\nSo the team was really like Oriol you should play, at some point I\ndecided okay I'll play against the agent I played when it was just strong enough\nthat there was no chance for me to win and I just basically lost the window for\nme to kind of defeat the agent sadly so cool, victory not for me AlphaStar has broken into the top 200 players in Europe at StarCraft II\nplaying the full version of the game with all three alien races. We are here not trying to solve StarCraft we're trying to utilize\nStarCraft for the purpose of advancing AI research but be applied to any domain\nthat utilizes artificial intelligence in any of its components and enhance for\ninstance its robustness its capabilities to do imitation learning from experts\nand other things that we deem super important and that StarCraft really lets\nus test on one of the most complicated video games ever created. Success in the real world is a little more complicated computer games can readily provide the\ndata points an AI needs to master a challenge but not every problem provides\nso much accurate feedback. The integration of AI into everyday life\nwill be a much longer battle","-Fz3JlGABrs":"For decades people have been \nfascinated by creatures of the past. What did they look like? How did they move? Many theories have been\ndeveloped for many species. Now researchers have turned their attention\nto an ancient creature called Orobates. Which lived before the\ndinosaurs roamed the earth. Using cutting-edge techniques,\nfrom computer modeling to robotics, they think they've worked out how it moved. Orobates lived around \n280 million years ago. It was a time when vertebrates were\nstill quite new to walking on land. But its skeleton has been exquisitely preserved. To work out how it might have moved researchers scanned the fossil in three dimensions and used this to construct a digital\nmodel of the Orobates' skeleton. This model could then be animated sort of like a digital marionette. The marionette helped them\nwork out the range of motion for each joint telling them how far Orobates\ncould bend or stretch. But it's unlikely that Orobates walked using its full range of motion in every joint so they needed to narrow it down a bit. One way to do that is to look at another fossil, not of Orobates itself but of its tracks. This fossil shows where an Orobates\nspecimen placed its feet long ago as it rambled across the ground. Programming the skeleton marionette to\nwalk inside the fossilized footsteps narrowed down its movement further, but there are still many options for how an Orobates could have made the footprints. To narrow it down more researchers\nturned to living animals. The layout of Orobates' skeleton suggests\n it would have had a sprawling gait like modern-day lizards or salamanders. So researchers used x-ray video\nto film four such creatures. These data helped them identify four key parameters which define sprawling movement. These four parameters were used\nas the basis for a dynamic simulation containing the skeleton marionette and the footprints. As the weighting of these four traits is adjusted the simulation spits out graphs\ncontaining all the possible movement combinations which fit the bill. Then the researchers could pick through \nall the outputs to find the most likely options. But there's still a catch. Computer simulations can't account for everything, like the complexities of gravity. There are so many variables that it's\nreally hard to model them all in detail. So researchers went one step further to\nvalidate their predictions in the real world. They built OroBot. This scale-sized robot was also modeled \nand added to the dynamic simulation. Bringing with it more physical constraints narrowing down the options. And, combining all of these different approaches they settled on an answer. The researchers think the Orobates\nmoved with a relatively upright gait and had more advanced capabilities than \nexpected for such an early land dweller. And that hints at a different ecology. A more mobile animal may have been more\nadept at picking through the landscape and perhaps be able to travel further \nfrom water than scientists had predicted. The researchers hope that some of their methods could help reverse engineer the movement \nof other fossilized animals and they've made their model\navailable for free online.

The swarm is controlled by a rapidly-oscillating\nmagnetic field. Modifying the magnetic field allows the \u2018microswarm\u2019\nto move about. It can also change direction and shape, split\nup, rejoin, and even move through a maze. The idea is to imitate the swarms found in\nnature, in animals like birds or fish. These groups of individuals together form\nlarge shapes, but they're much more flexible than a single large creature would be. The same can be said of the microswarm. It\u2019s strong enough to manipulate small objects, but flexible enough to fit through narrow spaces. This technology may have medical applications\n\u2013 perhaps delivering drugs around the body or acting as a contrast agent for X-rays or\nultrasound scans. But although this microswarm is pretty good\nat getting through a simple maze, the inside of the human body is a much tougher challenge. Tricky obstacles like fast flowing blood cells\nand highly salty solutions can complicate things. So a lot more work is needed before magnetic nanoparticles can start swarming around inside your body.","VqMTNZsWvBU":"This dodecahedral cage is made of silica\nand it's tiny, really tiny. It was created by researchers in the States who hope that one day it could\nhelp in the fight against cancer. To give you a sense of just how\nsmall this nanocage is let's start with a single grain of salt,\nit's around 300 microns wide. Compare that to say a red\nblood cell, that's it there. Now compare the red blood\ncell to something much smaller like this the HIV virus. The silica nanocage is a bit more \nthan ten times smaller than that. To make it researchers use \na relatively simple technique. First they need a template. For\nthat they use soap molecules. When in solution the soap molecules\nform tiny balls called micelles. The size of the micelles is precisely\ncontrolled by the researchers. Then they add a silica precursor to the mix. Gradually the negatively charged\nsilica precursors are attracted to the positively\ncharged micelle template. Over time they build up forming the structure. The template could\nthen be washed or burned out which would leave a \nperfect dodecahedral cage. What's more this process happens without any intervention, it's self assembling. This is how the researchers\nthink that the cages form but until recently they\ndidn't even know they existed. They're so small it's nearly impossible\nto snap a picture of them. To get that glimpse of the nanocages\nresearchers used cryo-electron microscopy. They put their sample on a tiny disc\nand plunge it into liquid nitrogen flash freezing it. Then they can use an electron\nmicroscope to take a peak, making images that look a bit like this. They repeated the process over and over to gather nearly 20,000 images of\nthe fuzzy looking cages, all lying in slightly different positions at\ndifferent angles and orientations. Now here's the clever bit. A computer\ncan analyze and average out all the different images of all the different\norientations of the structure. So feed them into a computer and an algorithm\ncan reconstruct a 3D representation. And what popped out was a perfect\ndodecahedron, only 11 nanometers across. Studies have shown that ultra-small\nsilica particles can easily and safely pass through the body being excreted in\nthe urine, rather than getting stuck in the liver which can cause side effects. Perhaps nanocages like these\ncould be used as containers for things like\nanti-cancer drugs or as ultra small vehicles to carry diagnostic molecules. But that is still a long way off.","aV07hCF7-AQ":"For decades, scientists have been working on materials\nthat can change shape. Whether it's bending, contracting, or wriggling along, these kinds of smart materials could be useful for robotics, engineering and medicine. So far, many of these materials transform relatively slowly. Sometimes they need to be connected to a controller with wires or tubes, or they have a limited range of movements. Now scientists have developed a flexible smart material that is remotely activated can move in multiple ways, and can transform quickly, changing its shape completely in less than a second. This material can be 3D printed, and scientists use magnets to change its shape. The technique uses a soft silicon rubber embedded with tiny particles of iron. A magnetic field is used to magnetise the substance creating a magnetic material that can be printed into any shape And, the direction of the magnetic field can be changed during printing. The result is a material with a non-uniform polarity meaning each part of the structure can respond differently to a magnetic charge. Scientists added a red filter to film the movements. The system is so precise that researchers can program a computer model to move in a certain way print it out, and the same movement can be replicated exactly in the physical structure. The team have already made shapes that can contract, Deform, Stop a ball, Catch a ball, and even jump. But there are countless more possibilities If it can be modelled, it can be made. Because the magnetic field is applied remotely, these materials can be used in small, inaccessible places. In medicine this could be useful inside the body for delivering drugs or in surgery Or in robotics, the complex shape changes could give soft robots flexible appendages. In fact, along with existing smart materials, this speedy shape-changing technology has numerous potential uses in a range of industries all with just the flip of a magnetic switch.","MNctvU0LZ9M":"Te electric knife fish or electric eel\nto its friends, has one of the most shocking talents in the animal kingdom,\nliterally. Used to sense and attack prey the electric eel's ability to generate\nstore and release jolts from within its body has fascinated scientists for\ncenturies, and now they're mimicking it on a quest to create a flexible bio-battery which could power all kinds of futuristic tech, to wear on our bodies\nand even inside our bodies. To make an electric eel inspired battery\nthe first thing to understand is how the eels do it. Enter specialised cells\ncalled electrocytes. These cells have membranes that allow certain charged\nions to pass through, leaving the cell in a neutral state when it's resting. When\nthe eel is ready to strike, channels on one side of the cell open and positive\nions rush in generating a current and zap! It's curtains for the unsuspecting\nprey. Each electrocyte only produces around\n150 millivolts, but large eels can have thousands of them packed together like a\nbattery. Using some clever nervous system timing they're able to activate them all\nsimultaneously making for a hefty shock. Scientists based at the University of\nFreiburg in Switzerland took inspiration from this process to create an\nartificial electric organ They used blobs of hydrogel to mimic each part of\nthe electrocyte - yellow and green blobs act as the selectively permeable\nmembranes, red and blue blobs contain different levels of the ions. Just like\nthe eel, ions rush across these membranes to generate a current. Each group of four\nblobs can produce about the same voltage as an electric eel's electrocyte. Also\nlike the eel scientists wanted to stack their artificial cells up to increase\nthe voltage, but how do you do that? One answer: printing. When laid on top of each\nother these two sheets, laden with hydrogel\nblobs, form one long line of repeating units - enough to generate about a hundred volts. Now there's one more thing; the eel fires\nall of its electrocytes simultaneously to get maximum voltage and the\nscientists need to do the same. To get that high voltage all of the gels need\nto contact at the same time. The sheets made it faster but for truly\nsimultaneous connections the researchers came up with another idea: folding. This\nallowed all the biogel blobs to touch each other almost simultaneously. The eel\ncan recharge its battery biologically within its body, whereas right now the\nartificial battery needs to be connected up to a power source. Researchers want to\nuse their battery to power things like contact lenses with integrated displays,\nor biological sensors or even wearable tech, so the hope is that their battery\ntoo will one day be recharged biologically. After all if the eel can do\nit, why can't we? Right  ","ksQPYjLEKYk":"If you'd asked me 10 years ago when I started my lab that I'll be, you know - I'll have a one-kilometre tunnel and recording from a whole colony of bats I'll  tell you you're nuts. I'm studying the\nhippocampal formation a set of brain areas that have to do with learning and memory. And I'm studying those brain areas in somewhat unusual animal models - in bats. Bats, I think they are very cute. The bats that we work with, Egyptian fruit bats have these interesting behaviours that we try to utilize and that give advantages over the standard animal models\nwhich are mice and rats. So for example if we want\nto ask questions about how 3D space - three dimensional space \nis represented in the brain bats are flying mammals so obviously\nthey're a good choice for that. Also another advantage is that bats have two distal sensory systems -\nvision and echolocation. We can trade-off these two senses and ask how\nthe same spaces are represented under these two, systems which are\ndifficult to do in rats or mice. We also ask questions about how very large\nspaces are represented in the brain. So we've built this long tunnel - 200 metre\nlong - and we are building this year an even longer tunnel - almost 1 kilometre\nlong. And we have bats flying there you know 100, 120 times back and forth while we record neurons in their brain and we see, you know, very different\nrepresentation in this enormous space. So we implant these small electrodes\nin the bats that allow us to record the activity of single neurons\nin those brain areas. And we have developed these small\nwireless electrophysiology devices called neural loggers, that are really small\nand sit on top of the animal, which allow us to record wirelessly\nin a bat as its flying around. And then we can have them\nfly in a large flight room or in various large-scale spaces\nthat we have built, and study their representation of space. We can\nalso have bats interacting and ask more social questions on the bats. What I'm really interested in is the\nneural basis of natural behaviours. You know neuroscience has traditionally\nfocused on either, of course anaesthetised animals, animals that don't behave at all. Or if they're you know doing behaviours \nthey're doing highly controlled behaviours you know lever pressing or nose poking in some very, you know 30 centimetre size box. The big plus size of side of it is it is highly controlled so you can get very repeated\nvery controlled experiments. The minus side of it is it's very far\nremoved from natural behaviour from what the brain evolved to\nactually do outdoors. And so I really believe, in addition to having those\nhighly controlled experiments, we should ideally record the same neurons or at\nleast from the same brain areas from an animal behaving in a more natural situation. Now that the technology allows it\nthat we have technology for wireless electrophysiology \nfor recording for freely moving animals. You know from wireless optogenetics, \ncamera arrays with microphones with movement sensors all sorts of devices\nwere not available until a few years ago. we can really study the neural basis of behaviour for the first time for real.","mOL16tYbAkM":"My name's Chris Brierly and I'm a\nlecturer in climate modeling in the geography department, and I'd like to tell you about our\nrecent work that we've just published in an article called Patterns and mechanisms\nof early pliocene warmth in nature And what we did is we collected together\nestimates of sea surface temperature, that go back 5 million years, and these come from analyzing the\nchemistry of long sequences of mud drilled from the ocean floor, and trying to estimate temperature from\nthere, and what happens in the tropics is rather than\nthere being sort of a global warming (and so you get the pattern but everything\ncranks up a bit) you end up with the maximum temperatures not really\nincreasing very much but everywhere else catching up with those maximum\ntemperatures and so you end up with sort of a vast warmpool. When you move from a flatter sea surface temperature gradient\nencompassing the whole of the pacific and indian oceans to something happening more like\ntoday, then actually you're seeing large changes in rainfall, both locally and elsewhere in the world\nso over east Africa for example, and it has been suggested that those\nchanges in rainfall over east Africa could have been an important factor in\ndriving human evolution. Having found this 'world in the past' that's sort of a uniform thing that we\ndon't really understand why it happened, that would be sort of academic if it were not for all the other\nfactors that were important back then and so those other factors are the fact that we're looking at a warm\nworld, and with a carbon dioxide level similar\nto what we're breathing today and it was a\nvery long situation so it was a steady state of that world, and so in some respects that bears similarities\nto the future, and until we know the reason for the discrepancy between our\nexplanations and the data, I'm worried that we can't discount a\npossible future that has a vast pool of warm water covering the tropics and the nasty changes in the atmospheric\ncirculation and rainfall changes that would go along with that. But it could just be in some respects that our image of the past is wrong, that we've synthesised in this paper (I'd like to think it's not!) but it could be that it's wrong, or it could be that by assuming it's a similar condition to the \nfuture world, actually that's wrong and there's some critical factor that we haven't yet\ndiscovered. An 'in-general' message is that we know enough to do something about what's going on - we know that it's greenhouse gases that\nare causing a climate, or a change in climate, and we know that if we don't emit as many\ngreenhouse gases we have less change in climate, and so from that standpoint yes there's an uncertainty on exactly\nwhat the temperature change would be, but it doesn't change the fundamentals that more greenhouse gases means more\nclimate change. And so we know enough to act on that now. The major uncertainty in century scale climate projections is how much greenhouse gases, and other forcings, humans are\nactually going to emit. We're now developing sufficient science\nto be able to provide a  probability forecast and say 'OK well if you're worried about a 1%\nexcedence then you need to build your flood protection this high.' We're now exploiting\nthat uncertainty to provide extra information.","F3oohJu3mJY":"It's been 150 years since the first\nedition of Nature was published in 1869.

So I'm interested in looking at the covers over time and how they've\nchanged from being mostly advertisements on the cover to being very rich with\nimagery. Part of my job at Nature is to design the cover each week. But when the\njournal first started the front cover was completely different to anything we'd\ndo today. In fact for nearly 100 years the front page was just used for\nadvertising. You've got this which is more like announcements about\nevents more and then you get the instruments that come on the front. This is one of my\nfavorite covers from this era an advertisement for buying rock and fossil\ncollections, and there's one here for a sunshine recorder. It really shows how\nfor a long time science was in many ways a hobby or a gentleman's pursuit. Looking\nthrough the archived volumes we eventually found some covers with actual\nscience on them, but not until the 1960s, and even then it was still only text at\nthat point. It wasn't until a few years later that we started seeing figures and\nblack-and-white photography. It's so interesting that in this cover in 1967\nthe only hint content is this, the text here that says \"Structure of Jupiter\" and\nthen by 1974 we finally moved to actually visualizing the content as the\nmain event on the cover. Finally as we flicked through the books we started\nseeing not just black and white but full-color images filling the pages and\nI particularly appreciated the very of their time gradients that became\npopular. So this is in the mid-80s when gradients are really just kind of\nstarting. You know, gradients, cutouts, these covers were still being physically put\ntogether with tape. Before desktop publishing all of these designs had to\nbe made on paper. Photos were cut out and pasted down and gradients were made by\nairbrushing with paint. After being taped together the final\ncover was essentially photographed and the photograph sent to print. By the 90s Nature had embraced desktop publishing doing most of the work on computers\nusing software like Photoshop. There's a lot more stuff you can do with an image\nonce it's digital although some tweaks are a little more obvious in hindsight. And this is a classic from the beginning of the desktop publishing era and this\none is one of my particular favorites because it shows a bit of Photoshop\nmalfeasance. This is in 1997 and this is Dolly the sheep and this cover is\namazing because it really speaks volumes about the era in which it was made.\nIf you look closely Dolly you'll see that this foot here looks a bit\nstrange, and the reason is is because that's actually not Dolly's foot at all\nthis was cut out in Photoshop and if you look at the original picture you'll see\nthat it's Dolly's mother standing behind it became fashionable to do these sort\nof cutouts that were more intricate than can be done in paste-up so in this she\nhas a foot that's not her own which is fantastic. When I joined Nature I was\ngiven the opportunity to refine the cover design for the modern digital era.\nThis meant aligning our print and web design but also as Nature's first\ncreative director making sure that all covers were evaluated for their artistic\nmerit, as well as the scientific value of the research they showed. I started at Nature in 2011 so I'm just looking at some things from that era and I've\nlanded on actually one of my favorite covers from the very beginning when I\nstarted, which is looking at insect wings. I remember the authors of the paper\nsubmitted about 20 different insects and this particular one caught my eye\nbecause it was so unusual. I think it is a beautiful photograph but it also says\na lot about the era you know it's still a Photoshop cutout but it's meant to\nlook much more natural like it's in a studio, it's meant to give you the sense\nthat you're just looking at the object without any decoration really. What they don't yet have here in the archives of course is our latest cover for Nature's\none hundred and fiftieth anniversary we've collaborated with a team of\nnetwork scientists to produce a graphic representation of almost every paper\nNature has published since 1900 and I think it's pretty amazing having visited\nthe archives and seen the bound volumes of these papers to then see them\nrepresented like this on the cover. And this cover isn't just a static image, we\nhave also made a video to show the links between some of the most important\npapers in Nature's history, and an interactive experience so anyone can\nlook through the model and navigate their own way between different points.\nSo this is much more than just a print cover. I think it's a great way to \nmark our anniversary. But perhaps in a hundred and fifty years\nsome future Creative Director of Nature will be here in the archives looking\nover our interactive cover and commenting on how it's very retro and\nrepresentative of its time.","Fv4UfH6bJ-A":"This is the head of the World Health\nOrganization Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Earlier this year he DM'd me on\nTwitter. He said I should come to the DRC and see for myself how complicated Ebola\nwas to control there. A few months later I was flying to the Eastern DRC. One of the first things I noticed once I landed was the presence of tanks and soldiers.\nThere's been decades of conflict in the area and war and political instability\nare really at the root of why Ebola has been so hard to contain. This is a photo outside of an Ebola centre. There's soldiers stationed behind sandbags at\nthe entrance. The reason they're there is that this particular Ebola center had\nalready been attacked twice, had been burnt to the ground. But at the same time\nthe presence of soldiers might be intimidating for some people. And that's\non top of the fact that Ebola is a terrifying disease and then the response\nto Ebola is also strange and terrifying. Someone in this household was diagnosed\nwith Ebola and now there's these Ebola responders dressed in these weird white\nTyvek suits who come in and just douse all of somebody's belongings in chlorine.\nSome people have even set up chairs to watch the whole scene. But the care being offered to \npeople is improving compared to previous outbreaks.\nHere's within an Ebola treatment centre and there's a plastic cube around\na patient that allows family members to see in and patients to see out. In\naddition this time there's not only intravenous fluids that are given to\nevery patient but people are getting experimental Ebola drugs and two of\nthose Ebola drugs have now been proven to be up to 90% effective if people get\nthem early. And the other bright spot is that there's now an Ebola vaccine that's\nbeen widely deployed in this outbreak for the first time. So you would think\nthat this outbreak would be contained by now but it's not and there's a few\nreasons for that. One of them is that it's difficult to know who is at high\nrisk. Also vaccine teams can't vaccinate people who don't want to be vaccinated. And people aren't getting experimental drugs if they don't go into Ebola\ncentres. What they'll do first is go to the places they're used to going so that\ncould be a pastor, it could be a traditional healer, it could be a small\npharmacy or a small clinic. These sort of pharmacies are just all over the place.\nThere's hundreds of them. You can see like a snake around a chalice that's\nsort of an insignia. This is a photo inside of one of these health facilities.\nThis woman is feverish and rather than have her mix with all of the other\npatients that might show up there they've decided to put patients who have\nsymptoms of Ebola in one area so that they're separated from others. So in this\nroom a mother's sitting by her child and the doctor thinks the child should\nperhaps go to an Ebola treatment centre but the mother doesn't want her\nchild to go. And if you can put yourself in the mother's shoes,\nthe Ebola centre's about an hour away, she'd have to be separated, she can't\nhold her child, she can't be there next to him. This is the kind of mistrust or\nreluctance that comes from a place of love and concern and not conflict This is a photo of an Ebola checkpoint. These are set up to contain the outbreak. What\nhappens is when people go past they have their temperature taken and if they have\na fever they're not allowed to travel through a checkpoint. And these\ncheckpoints have been very helpful but at the same time they're not bulletproof.\nPeople with Ebola have now traveled to Goma in North Kivu which is a very\ninternational city and they've now traveled 700 kilometers south. What all of this comes down to is that Dr Tedros has a huge amount of work in front\nof him. The world has completely ignored a humanitarian crisis in the DRC for a\nquarter century. That crisis is why the Ebola outbreak has now killed more than\n2,000 people and if we keep ignoring Ebola too - it's only going to help the virus\nspread.","YNGBIC1zq8c":"This is the nucleus of the galaxy M87 and this is the first ever image of a black hole. (applause) When I saw the first image I said, you know, wow, that's it. It's a true, like a Eureka moment, in our scientific lives. We're looking at this... the mystery of nature that has never... uncovered, right, so... (laughs) So this is it. We've finally seen it. Scientists came up with this crazy idea in the 1930s and they never imagined that one day we would actually see a black hole. It's so far only a few blurry splotches of light and yet they contain so much information\nabout the physics of the universe. I've been dreaming about this for 25 years. When I saw the first data it was just some weird plot and it looked like there could be a ring in there. I was like oh my god, this is gonna be interesting. It looks pretty much what we were\nexpecting which was for a theoretician is always an, you know, a dramatic moment\nwhen you have to compare what you spent years simulating with what actually\nnature is telling you. This is just like kind of the beginning of being able to have another window into what black holes can tell us about our laws and, and physics... um, but already we've learned so much, so you know, we didn't know, even though we had predicted that if you had a black hole that you would see this\nring of light, we didn't know we were gonna get that ring of light. And that's you\nknow what we were kind of testing. We could have gotten just a blob. And so\nseeing that ring and seeing a ring that has a size that is consistent with other\nmeasurements that had been done completely differently... I think that in\nitself just being able to see that ring of light, being able to see that that ring\nexists, is huge. We are also releasing this data that has, from the event\nhorizon telescope that were used to create this image, so whoever out there\nhas a you know alternative theory of gravity can just grab this data and test it. Well the big goal still is to make an image of the black hole in the centre  of our Milky Way, because it has a much better determined mass and so we can do\nmuch better tests of general relativity. And we can also have other telescopes\nlook at it. There are near-infrared interferometers which see gas going around it so combining all this information will give us a much better image of how black holes actually work. The picture we have seen today is only a first taste of what the Event Horizon Telescope can deliver. Already the data they have in the bag can produce a lot more information, for example about what produces the jets, these enormous beams of light that we see coming out of the galaxy M87. Also the team has collected a lot of data about another black hole, the one at the center of our own galaxy. And they haven't even started analyzing that, so stay tuned there's a lot more to come you","xrIjFVMliOQ":"amyotrophic Lateral sclerosis Shortened to Als is a neurodegenerative disease Which usually begins in adulthood and Advances rapidly?

More than 30 metres below the surface, \ncoral reefs still flourish in the gloom. But these deep reefs could be under threat from a powerful force: Hurricanes. Scientists have long known that shallow reefs\nare vulnerable to hurricanes with corals torn apart as the winds stir up the sea. But the reefs of the twilight zone have been\nassumed\u00a0to be protected from the worst effects. These deeper reefs have also been thought\u00a0to\u00a0\nprovide a temporary refuge for shallow-reef species,\u00a0which\u00a0could\nshelter in the\u00a0deeper water. But new research is telling a different story. Scientists in Puerto Rico have been studying reefs both before and after Hurricane Maria,\na particularly violent storm. They\u2019ve already shown that the hurricane caused \ncurrents and upwellings deep into the twilight zone. Next they plan to assess damage to the deeper\ncorals directly in Maria\u2019s path. The deep-reaching effects of strong hurricanes would be\u00a0bad news for species\u00a0on the hunt\nfor somewhere to\u00a0weather the storm. Of course, coral reefs have been \nsurviving hurricanes for millennia but extreme weather events are getting\nmore common as the climate changes. Human activity is also causing ocean \nacidification and warming. This can lead to diseases and coral bleaching and recent research suggests\nthat deeper reefs could be just as vulnerable\u00a0as shallow ones. Coral reefs\u00a0provide coastlines\nwith a line of defence against storms. So\u00a0losing this delicate resource could\u00a0add yet more pressure to regions already devastated\nby the effects of climate change.","fLlr-4IU7d4":"This island in the Indian Ocean supports\nthriving seabird colonies and rich coral reefs but nearby other islands are eerily silent. The cause of this difference lies in a complex web\nof birds, rats, coral...and poop. The Chagos archipelago in the Indian Ocean\nis home to over 60 tropical islands nearly a third of which are completely free\nfrom invasive species like rats or foxes. This safe haven for birds creates quite the cacophony. So here we are in the Chagos Archipelago We're on a rat-free island, there's never been rats on this particular island There's a huge abundance and diversity of seabirds here Terns, shearwaters, boobies, frigatebirds. On neighboring islands, however, \nthe arrival of sailing ships in the 1800s brought an unwanted visitor - rats. The rodents bred like, well, rodents. They devoured seabird eggs and chicks\nuntil they all but wiped out the bird populations. In contrast to this island where there's rats, there's very, very few seabirds. The skies are empty and it's very quiet. But the story doesn't stop there, because the birds\nplay a critical role in the wider ecosystem all thanks to their poop. Now these birds return to the islands where they roost and they breed and they deposit huge amounts of guano, or bird poo, on to the islands. And this guano is highly rich in nitrogen So they're effectively fertilising the islands. This nitrogen is great for plants,\nwhich thrive on the rat-free islands. But scientists wondered whether this \naerial nitrogen delivery system was also impacting the surrounding coral reefs. So we then went out into the shallow waters there and sampled sponges that filter feed and macroalgae. And those fish that are feeding on the algae out on the reef crest, we were able to look at their growth rates. The team found that rat-free islands had two-and-a-half \ntimes more nitrogen across the entire ecosystem and fish living on the nearby reefs grew faster and bigger than those around rat-infested islands. These fish graze on algae that otherwise covers the coral, slowing its growth. The scientists observed three times more grazing\non the reefs surrounding rat-free islands. These healthier reefs may be more resilient \nto climate change. When it comes to interwoven ecosystems \nlike those of the Chagos Archipelago it seems invasive species like rats have\na bigger impact than we thought. So de-ratting oceanic islands in archipelagos\nsuch as this should really be a very high priority for conservation. It's not difficult to de-rat these islands. and it would have a huge impact on both the terrestrial environment and the adjacent marine environment. The team is now urging governments to consider \ninvesting in rat extermination programmes as a way to save coral reefs. This unusual solution could  be a quick and \ncost-effective tool in the fight against coral decline all due to a complex chain linking rats,\nbirds, fish, coral, and poop.","JsypVU8VkS4":"It's a tough gig being a pollinator\nthese days, especially in big cities. Land is being used differently and\nthat's a threat to pollinating insects. But a new study of four UK cities\nshows that increasing urbanization doesn't have to be a death sentence. A team of ecologists looked at nine\ntypes of land use that make up most of a city's area, if you exclude buildings,\nroads and water which aren't much use to pollinators anyway. First, they counted the total number of\npollinators and plants in each area, recording how many different \nspecies there were as well. The more numerous and varied the plants, \nthe greater the biodiversity of pollinators. No surprises there. Gardens held the most and\nmost varied pollinating insects, but not all garden plants\nare equally appealing. Hydrangeas, daisies and forget-me-nots\nwere less appetising, whereas among pollinators' favourite flowers were\ndandelions, brambles and buttercups - ones that gardeners often pull up. Next, the researchers wanted to know\nhow land could be better managed to support pollinator communities,\nso they built a computer model to test how giving more land\nto each different land use might make pollinator\nnetworks more robust, in other words, more\nresilient to species loss. They found that the biggest\nbounce in robustness came when they allotted more space to allotments,\neven though, with the boost, allotments still only accounted for\nless than 1% of city space. Allotments host fruits, vegetables\nand weeds as well - a mix which provides a great variety of flowers. The researchers also wondered if\nthere were other ways to boost the robustness of pollinator communities. According to their model, this could be\nachieved by planting more flowers in parks and allowing wildflowers to grow\nin verges and other green spaces. A few simple strategies,\nsay the researchers, could help support pollinators\nin cities across the world. Add more allotments,\nplant flowers in parks and don't mow the grass!","nIQWpsyoeoo":"This is the story of an \nevolutionary trap. A trap laid by people, but which led to the \ndemise of thousands of butterflies. What went wrong?\nAnd can we stop it happening again? We start in a meadow in Nevada\nwith the Edith's Checkerspot butterfly. Like many butterflies, the Edith's Checkerspot has favourite plants on which to lay its eggs. in this meadow the butterflies' first\nchoice is called the Blue-eyed Mary. The butterflies lay their\neggs in the spring. A fortnight later they hatch, \nand the ravenous caterpillars feed for two weeks, before\nthe plant starts to die back and the caterpillars\nenter a dormant state. Next spring, \nwhen the Blue-eyed Marys regrow, the caterpillars wake up, \ngorge themselves, and build a cocoon. Then they finally emerge as a butterfly. This cycle has been going on \nfor generations, until humans brought in cattle. And with the cows came an\ninvasive plant called Ribwort Plantain. The Plantain doesn't die back in the\nsummer like the Blue-eyed Mary so caterpillars which hatch on the\nPlantain have longer to eat before entering their dormant state, helping\nmore of them survive to adulthood. What's more, a mother butterfly with a\npreference for Plantain is likely to pass that preference\non to her caterpillars. The evolutionary trap was set. Gradually, the whole population of butterflies\nbecame dependent on the Plantain, abandoning the \nBlue-eyed Mary entirely. The butterflies did well, \nfor a while... Until in 2005, \nthe cattle ranchers moved out. Without the cows, grass quickly grew,\nengulfing the Plantain and hiding it from\nthe butterflies. Without the Plantain to lay their eggs on \nthe butterflies were done for. They couldn't adapt fast enough\nto switch back to the Blue-eyed Mary. Within a year they all died. For four years there were no more\nEdith's Checkerspots in the meadow. But that wasn't the end... Luckily, butterflies from other meadows which\nnever abandoned the Blue-eyed Mary moved in, and the population\nis now recovering. This is the first time that this kind of \nevolutionary trap has been recorded, and around the world, more traps\nlike it could already be set waiting to go off. Conservationists normally look for\nproblems when humans arrive, but this trap was sprung\nwhen people left. It's important to remember that\nhumans make changes quickly, but evolution needs longer to react.
