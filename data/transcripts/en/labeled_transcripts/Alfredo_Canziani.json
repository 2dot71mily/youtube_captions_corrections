understands","start":427.179,"duration":7.02},{"text":"okay but there are a few tricks that","start":428.379,"duration":8.58},{"text":"have come up through a combination

end-to-end","start":1702.539,"duration":3.12},{"text":"so the complication here of course is","start":1703.53,"duration":5.759},{"text":"the fact that the parameters are on the","start":1705.659,"duration":5.13},{"text":"first box how do you know how to turn","start":1709.289,"duration":3.451},{"text":"them so that the output does you

it's","start":1749.669,"duration":8.151},{"text":"actually a point but it's a manual point","start":1753.51,"duration":4.31},{"text":"so since they have to be nonlinear

nonlinear","start":1771.99,"duration":5.0},{"text":"and your eyes quickly that it has to","start":1778.14,"duration":9.18},{"text":"look something like this so take

to","start":5602.82,"duration":9.84},{"text":"motivation it's again the surface area","start":5606.48,"duration":7.8},{"text":"of the person right so it's bounded

more","start":5793.04,"duration":7.639},{"text":"questions if there is any","start":5797.03,"duration":3.649},{"text":"yes okay so the question is is there","start":5804.01,"duration":12.72},{"text":"some sort of pre-processing like PC air","start":5815.17,"duration":4.41},{"text":"that will find those vectors yeah so PCI","start":5816.73,"duration":6.27},{"text":"will find those if the manifold is","start":5819.58,"duration":6.11},{"text":"linear so if you assume that the surface","start":5823.0,"duration":5.37},{"text":"occupied by all those examples or faces","start":5825.69,"duration":7.12},{"text":"is a plane then PCA will find the","start":5828.37,"duration":6.39},{"text":"dimension of that plane principal","start":5832.81,"duration":6.75},{"text":"component analysis right but no it's not","start":5834.76,"duration":12.72},{"text":"linear unfortunately right let me yeah","start":5839.56,"duration":11.22},{"text":"let me give you an example if you take","start":5847.48,"duration":5.07},{"text":"me and my older son that looks like me","start":5850.78,"duration":5.58},{"text":"and you place us to making the same

my","start":5860.92,"duration":6.63},{"text":"face shifted by 20 pixels there's more","start":5863.62,"duration":6.21},{"text":"distance between me and myself shifted","start":5867.55,"duration":5.84},{"text":"than there is between me and my son okay","start":5869.83,"duration":9.57},{"text":"so what that means is that you know the","start":5873.39,"duration":7.39},{"text":"manifold of my face you know is some","start":5879.4,"duration":3.21},{"text":"complicated manifold in that space my","start":5880.78,"duration":3.3},{"text":"son is a very different manifold which","start":5882.61,"duration":5.22},{"text":"does not intersect mine yet these

another","start":5897.64,"duration":7.05},{"text":"reason why that that surface is not is","start":5901.81,"duration":5.88},{"text":"not a plane you're looking at me right","start":5904.69,"duration":5.43},{"text":"now I imagine the manifold which is a","start":5907.69,"duration":4.17},{"text":"linear manifold one dimensional manifold","start":5910.12,"duration":5.66},{"text":"of me turning my head all the way 360","start":5911.86,"duration":8.49},{"text":"okay that manifold is

is","start":5924.57,"duration":5.82},{"text":"not going to find it","start":5927.85,"duration":2.54},{"text":"okay I gotta blast off thanks to you","start":5931.63,"duration":5.09},{"text":"next

things","start":199.84,"duration":3.84},{"text":"don't quite work but you still apply","start":202.09,"duration":2.759},{"text":"yourselves so that's actually

I","start":250.329,"duration":6.421},{"text":"take a picture of these of something","start":254.859,"duration":3.66},{"text":"right let's say I take a picture","start":256.75,"duration":5.849},{"text":"if one one megapixel camera so how","start":258.519,"duration":7.261},{"text":"many dimension will be my image so if I","start":262.599,"duration":5.16},{"text":"take an image I can consider my image","start":265.78,"duration":5.19},{"text":"which is gonna have RGB plane and

3","start":281.169,"duration":7.081},{"text":"million right ok cool so you can think","start":286.389,"duration":4.56},{"text":"about this image which can be thought

dog","start":323.469,"duration":7.25},{"text":"who thinks the cut the other one is here","start":326.05,"duration":7.859},{"text":"ok maybe you were actually paying","start":330.719,"duration":5.38},{"text":"attention yesterday who were thinking","start":333.909,"duration":4.171},{"text":"who thinks the other point is gonna be","start":336.099,"duration":5.07},{"text":"here okay who thinks the other point is","start":338.08,"duration":6.179},{"text":"gonna be here fantastic ok so you","start":341.169,"duration":5.22},{"text":"actually on the right thing so","start":344.259,"duration":3.84},{"text":"everything is just in the same

very","start":439.41,"duration":6.15},{"text":"nice in this book introduction to linear","start":443.31,"duration":4.86},{"text":"algebra by Gilbert Strang so you may","start":445.56,"duration":5.55},{"text":"want to you know look up this stuff but","start":448.17,"duration":5.64},{"text":"the other one is this one here so you'd","start":451.11,"duration":4.5},{"text":"like to check the third tweet here where","start":453.81,"duration":3.75},{"text":"I show you the essence of linear algebra","start":455.61,"duration":5.82},{"text":"by I grant maybe you know this guy Brian","start":457.56,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Sanders if you don't know well you","start":461.43,"duration":5.4},{"text":"should know now just check this link","start":463.83,"duration":4.41},{"text":"right and this link is going to show you","start":466.83,"duration":5.19},{"text":"how you move stuff around okay anyhow it","start":468.24,"duration":6.57},{"text":"was the first link for today so how do","start":472.02,"duration":5.4},{"text":"you move things around in a space for","start":474.81,"duration":3.93},{"text":"the one actually didn't know how the","start":477.42,"duration":4.95},{"text":"energy linear algebra works you just","start":478.74,"duration":8.88},{"text":"talk it down raise their hands huh okay","start":482.37,"duration":8.24},{"text":"matrix multiplication buddha's edo","start":487.62,"duration":7.41},{"text":"rotation and here","start":490.61,"duration":6.79},{"text":"okay first matrix multiplication is a","start":495.03,"duration":5.34},{"text":"what kind of variation leaden","start":497.4,"duration":4.56},{"text":"transformation okay what are the linear","start":500.37,"duration":11.39},{"text":"transformation one rotation to you sure","start":501.96,"duration":14.09},{"text":"straighten okay fantastic then third","start":511.76,"duration":7.13},{"text":"stretching scaling I guess let's see","start":516.05,"duration":7.359},{"text":"scaling stretching this number two then","start":518.89,"duration":4.519},{"text":"if the determinant is negative what do","start":523.5,"duration":13.269},{"text":"you have what is it a reflection third","start":526.149,"duration":18.511},{"text":"and then one more is it okay I guess we","start":536.769,"duration":9.931},{"text":"have three for the moment this should be","start":544.66,"duration":3.15},{"text":"one more hold on","start":546.7,"duration":3.69},{"text":"so scaling right so you have scaling","start":547.81,"duration":5.55},{"text":"this way he has scaling in that way then","start":550.39,"duration":5.129},{"text":"you have rotation then you have","start":553.36,"duration":4.59},{"text":"reflection if there when you have","start":555.519,"duration":7.26},{"text":"reflection nano identity does nothing","start":557.95,"duration":5.34},{"text":"right","start":562.779,"duration":3.961},{"text":"so okay rotation means

scaling","start":569.95,"duration":7.889},{"text":"okay well I wish you in fantastic so we","start":573.959,"duration":5.201},{"text":"have at the four right so we have","start":577.839,"duration":3.331},{"text":"rotation we have zoom in this way you","start":579.16,"duration":3.72},{"text":"have shearing right and then you have","start":581.17,"duration":4.109},{"text":"the reflection whenever you have the","start":582.88,"duration":6.81},{"text":"negative determinant cool still I want","start":585.279,"duration":7.55},{"text":"you to move things around is motion","start":589.69,"duration":11.389},{"text":"translation is a linear operation no

if","start":613.029,"duration":5.041},{"text":"the 0 is mapped to 0 then you have a","start":616.48,"duration":2.52},{"text":"linear transformation","start":618.07,"duration":3.36},{"text":"anyhow so you have translation which is","start":619.0,"duration":4.14},{"text":"the fourth one at a fifth operation if","start":621.43,"duration":4.019},{"text":"you use affine transformations so all","start":623.14,"duration":4.17},{"text":"those nice things you're gonna be fine","start":625.449,"duration":4.741},{"text":"them there ok so check those things are","start":627.31,"duration":5.73},{"text":"very useful anyhow so finally we figure","start":630.19,"duration":6.06},{"text":"out that if I have everything up here we","start":633.04,"duration":5.82},{"text":"have cut hippopotamus dogs and whatever","start":636.25,"duration":6.35},{"text":"I want to take them down I want to","start":638.86,"duration":6.479},{"text":"translate right yes","start":642.6,"duration":6.37},{"text":"talk to me no you don't talk yet ok all","start":645.339,"duration":5.911},{"text":"right so we want to use translation and","start":648.97,"duration":3.36},{"text":"then you translate this","start":651.25,"duration":2.88},{"text":"in the z-row so you have all the things","start":652.33,"duration":3.57},{"text":"here then how do you separate those","start":654.13,"duration":6.48},{"text":"things apart so all of them are tall","start":655.9,"duration":10.2},{"text":"together how can i we mentioned what are","start":660.61,"duration":7.64},{"text":"the five different a four

how","start":679.78,"duration":5.91},{"text":"do we diagonalize matrices ha that is","start":683.32,"duration":4.53},{"text":"the second question you can figure out","start":685.69,"duration":5.49},{"text":"if you check Twitter so we open a new","start":687.85,"duration":7.53},{"text":"page we go Twitter again we go on top","start":691.18,"duration":7.26},{"text":"right should take a note about how to do","start":695.38,"duration":6.45},{"text":"this stuff you don't SVD parentheses","start":698.44,"duration":8.94},{"text":"from all the NZ okay cool","start":701.83,"duration":10.35},{"text":"now you go if you go here is like or SVD","start":707.38,"duration":8.04},{"text":"so this is from also Gilbert right so","start":712.18,"duration":4.8},{"text":"you also like to check these on if you","start":715.42,"duration":3.09},{"text":"click here it's gonna be more","start":716.98,"duration":3.3},{"text":"information about me term right","start":718.51,"duration":4.89},{"text":"last year oh okay you know too much no","start":720.28,"duration":5.4},{"text":"okay anyhow so you want to check this","start":723.4,"duration":4.74},{"text":"stuff out anyhow we'll figure out that","start":725.68,"duration":5.13},{"text":"by using matrices and scalars you can","start":728.14,"duration":5.1},{"text":"move things around and then you can zoom","start":730.81,"duration":4.95},{"text":"right and so again I have things all","start":733.24,"duration":4.95},{"text":"collapsed here I can't do anything so I","start":735.76,"duration":4.97},{"text":"take it down with a translation right","start":738.19,"duration":5.33},{"text":"yes no make do like that with your head","start":740.73,"duration":8.32},{"text":"no you follow in there yes no okay","start":743.52,"duration":9.19},{"text":"it's boring no okay alright so you take","start":749.05,"duration":4.77},{"text":"a reason you put it down with","start":752.71,"duration":3.51},{"text":"translation and then you zoom it right","start":753.82,"duration":4.4},{"text":"with a matrix perhaps diagonal with some","start":756.22,"duration":5.97},{"text":"singular values right cool cool cool","start":758.22,"duration":6.91},{"text":"and then what so I have this thing","start":762.19,"duration":5.67},{"text":"zoomed up though so classification what","start":765.13,"duration":6.45},{"text":"is it how do you perform classification","start":767.86,"duration":10.53},{"text":"now you I'd like you'd like to assign","start":771.58,"duration":9.93},{"text":"labels but how do you do that so","start":778.39,"duration":4.65},{"text":"whatever you would like to do is going","start":781.51,"duration":3.06},{"text":"to be basically moving these points in","start":783.04,"duration":2.59},{"text":"different regions","start":784.57,"duration":3.46},{"text":"and then you slice them okay and so this","start":785.63,"duration":3.84},{"text":"is problem is gonna be part of the next","start":788.03,"duration":3.45},{"text":"class and now I'm just showing you how a","start":789.47,"duration":5.7},{"text":"neural network does this I hope you're","start":791.48,"duration":7.2},{"text":"gonna be enjoying this video if I find","start":795.17,"duration":13.47},{"text":"my cursor okay so all right so we start","start":798.68,"duration":13.29},{"text":"from here for screen perhaps all right","start":808.64,"duration":6.21},{"text":"so can you see anything no how do you","start":811.97,"duration":3.66},{"text":"turn off the lights","start":814.85,"duration":3.78},{"text":"can someone figure out how to oh maybe","start":815.63,"duration":15.39},{"text":"here yes no good night hold on all right","start":818.63,"duration":16.53},{"text":"good night so at least then I'd turn it","start":831.02,"duration":6.42},{"text":"back so here we start with these five","start":835.16,"duration":4.62},{"text":"branches of a spiral and you can see","start":837.44,"duration":4.76},{"text":"that each point is gonna be basically","start":839.78,"duration":5.19},{"text":"represented as what how can you","start":842.2,"duration":4.3},{"text":"represent each of those points without","start":844.97,"duration":7.23},{"text":"the color okay where do these points","start":846.5,"duration":9.3},{"text":"live on a 2d plane right so this is a 2d","start":852.2,"duration":5.85},{"text":"plane this screen here so each of those","start":855.8,"duration":7.68},{"text":"points is represented as a is a tuple","start":858.05,"duration":7.26},{"text":"right that is representing the X and the","start":863.48,"duration":3.84},{"text":"y coordinate then the color there","start":865.31,"duration":4.92},{"text":"represents a third dimension where it's","start":867.32,"duration":4.26},{"text":"going to be basically representing the","start":870.23,"duration":2.88},{"text":"class to which each of those points","start":871.58,"duration":3.27},{"text":"belong and here we have five different","start":873.11,"duration":4.29},{"text":"branches of a spiral so this is the","start":874.85,"duration":3.9},{"text":"input to my network is going to be a","start":877.4,"duration":4.08},{"text":"bunch of points without colors and then","start":878.75,"duration":4.89},{"text":"I ask my network to separate the points","start":881.48,"duration":4.32},{"text":"by color okay is it clear what is the","start":883.64,"duration":5.28},{"text":"task I ask my network you can authorize","start":885.8,"duration":4.98},{"text":"your hands because I cannot I cannot see","start":888.92,"duration":3.55},{"text":"it right so","start":890.78,"duration":4.06},{"text":"so you have to shout back because I","start":892.47,"duration":5.7},{"text":"don't see you you understand right","start":894.84,"duration":5.04},{"text":"what's going on here if sorry not right","start":898.17,"duration":3.84},{"text":"now so we start with this guy here which","start":899.88,"duration":6.15},{"text":"is just five branches of a spiral the","start":902.01,"duration":5.46},{"text":"network doesn't see the colors right now","start":906.03,"duration":3.33},{"text":"and the network will try to separate the","start":907.47,"duration":5.25},{"text":"colors apart so this is what my network","start":909.36,"duration":7.35},{"text":"does it takes the space the space space","start":912.72,"duration":6.27},{"text":"fabric and it performs like a stretching","start":916.71,"duration":4.26},{"text":"of the space fabric right how cool does","start":918.99,"duration":7.37},{"text":"that sound and you should do like oh oh","start":920.97,"duration":8.67},{"text":"see okay yeah we had to do multiple","start":926.36,"duration":5.41},{"text":"iterations I think here this your first","start":929.64,"duration":4.89},{"text":"class it's okay to be shy alright so","start":931.77,"duration":4.23},{"text":"this is my network which is basically","start":934.53,"duration":3.96},{"text":"stretching the space fabric in order to","start":936.0,"duration":4.5},{"text":"get all those points that are belonging","start":938.49,"duration":4.35},{"text":"to the same color to the same class to","start":940.5,"duration":5.1},{"text":"be in the same subspace of this final","start":942.84,"duration":6.06},{"text":"manifold such that once we reach","start":945.6,"duration":5.22},{"text":"convergence so whenever we reach at the","start":948.9,"duration":5.37},{"text":"end of this animation you have all your","start":950.82,"duration":7.34},{"text":"points that belongs to different spirals","start":954.27,"duration":8.04},{"text":"very separable and so now you can just","start":958.16,"duration":6.49},{"text":"use logistic regression right or like","start":962.31,"duration":4.53},{"text":"one versus all whatever regression is","start":964.65,"duration":6.06},{"text":"called yeah I don't know so I mean this","start":966.84,"duration":6.45},{"text":"is the last matrix is represented by","start":970.71,"duration":6.48},{"text":"that that for five arrows there so of","start":973.29,"duration":5.79},{"text":"those five arrows represent a matrix","start":977.19,"duration":5.45},{"text":"which is how many rows how many columns","start":979.08,"duration":6.39},{"text":"so what is my output dimension here of","start":982.64,"duration":6.04},{"text":"this network what are we trying to infer","start":985.47,"duration":6.57},{"text":"in this case the classes how many","start":988.68,"duration":6.6},{"text":"classes do we have five so the number of","start":992.04,"duration":8.61},{"text":"rows of this matrix will be five right","start":995.28,"duration":7.05},{"text":"because they are height of the matrix is","start":1000.65,"duration":3.72},{"text":"they the same dimension where you shoot","start":1002.33,"duration":4.38},{"text":"in two and the width of the matrix","start":1004.37,"duration":4.469},{"text":"represents the space where you're","start":1006.71,"duration":4.29},{"text":"shooting from right and so what is going","start":1008.839,"duration":3.781},{"text":"to be what's going to be my width of","start":1011.0,"duration":5.49},{"text":"this matrix - right so this matrix is","start":1012.62,"duration":5.61},{"text":"going to be a high times two because we","start":1016.49,"duration":3.54},{"text":"are shooting towards five dimensions the","start":1018.23,"duration":4.02},{"text":"five colors over here and then we have","start":1020.03,"duration":2.76},{"text":"to","start":1022.25,"duration":3.28},{"text":"two columns right so it's gonna be","start":1022.79,"duration":4.45},{"text":"basically the two coordinates of the tip","start":1025.53,"duration":4.56},{"text":"of the arrow and those are just centered","start":1027.24,"duration":5.16},{"text":"in zero we're going to talk about more","start":1030.09,"duration":4.83},{"text":"about that intersection I guess in later","start":1032.4,"duration":4.62},{"text":"lessons if I actually may manage to make","start":1034.92,"duration":5.55},{"text":"a video about that but can you see that","start":1037.02,"duration":6.83},{"text":"kind of cute intersection at the center","start":1040.47,"duration":5.28},{"text":"have you ever seen that kind of","start":1043.85,"duration":5.77},{"text":"intersection before have you ever taken","start":1045.75,"duration":8.94},{"text":"a bath I mean oh yeah bubbles right so","start":1049.62,"duration":6.24},{"text":"whenever you have multiple bubbles","start":1054.69,"duration":3.81},{"text":"touching together it looks like similar","start":1055.86,"duration":4.95},{"text":"to that perhaps maybe not that I don't","start":1058.5,"duration":4.47},{"text":"know it looks to me alright so that was","start":1060.81,"duration":4.95},{"text":"the first Network okay and this is how","start":1062.97,"duration":4.95},{"text":"this network work these networks","start":1065.76,"duration":4.74},{"text":"basically take the space fabric and then","start":1067.92,"duration":4.92},{"text":"apply some kind of transformation which","start":1070.5,"duration":4.56},{"text":"is still parametrized by matrices so I","start":1072.84,"duration":5.54},{"text":"have many many matrices then I have","start":1075.06,"duration":6.54},{"text":"nonlinearities why do I need many","start":1078.38,"duration":6.07},{"text":"matrices or why do I need nonlinearities","start":1081.6,"duration":4.32},{"text":"can I turn on the light oh you still","start":1084.45,"duration":5.97},{"text":"like to watch okay yeah otherwise start","start":1085.92,"duration":10.59},{"text":"flipping all right so so here it","start":1090.42,"duration":7.65},{"text":"basically this guy here is gonna be a","start":1096.51,"duration":3.75},{"text":"network with two matrices my first","start":1098.07,"duration":5.46},{"text":"matrix Maps my input which is living in","start":1100.26,"duration":7.05},{"text":"which space two dimensions to a","start":1103.53,"duration":7.29},{"text":"intermediate layer of 100 dimensions so","start":1107.31,"duration":6.36},{"text":"my network architecture is the following","start":1110.82,"duration":6.96},{"text":"so I have my two neurons here I met this","start":1113.67,"duration":8.19},{"text":"one two one two three so on here I have","start":1117.78,"duration":9.0},{"text":"100 then I have some non-linearity which","start":1121.86,"duration":6.48},{"text":"is going to be just the positive part","start":1126.78,"duration":6.63},{"text":"and then from this guy here I do","start":1128.34,"duration":7.89},{"text":"something cute or funny or weird I don't","start":1133.41,"duration":5.81},{"text":"know depends so from here I map down to","start":1136.23,"duration":5.31},{"text":"okay what should I do after let's say","start":1139.22,"duration":4.42},{"text":"this is this is my network what's gonna","start":1141.54,"duration":5.25},{"text":"be the last layer of this network Phi","start":1143.64,"duration":5.55},{"text":"right but how many dimension has this","start":1146.79,"duration":7.09},{"text":"screen so how can I plot","start":1149.19,"duration":18.15},{"text":"I don't say PCIe so I do listen okay","start":1153.88,"duration":13.46},{"text":"such that I can show you there the","start":1170.13,"duration":4.57},{"text":"intervener interpolation between this","start":1172.809,"duration":4.11},{"text":"point here which I call embedding in","start":1174.7,"duration":4.62},{"text":"this case but just a way I call this","start":1176.919,"duration":16.701},{"text":"stuff right now and my input okay","start":1179.32,"duration":14.3},{"text":"alright that's pretty much it so this is","start":1193.65,"duration":5.92},{"text":"my neural network has one input layer","start":1196.36,"duration":6.54},{"text":"one hidden layer one kind of embedding","start":1199.57,"duration":5.7},{"text":"layer which does nothing and a output","start":1202.9,"duration":4.8},{"text":"layer okay so it has one hidden and","start":1205.27,"duration":4.35},{"text":"overall I count this as three layer","start":1207.7,"duration":3.87},{"text":"neural network exact because it is one","start":1209.62,"duration":4.35},{"text":"two and then this stuff is linear right","start":1211.57,"duration":6.71},{"text":"so why do we need nonlinearities and","start":1213.97,"duration":4.31},{"text":"what can one layer okay said without","start":1221.37,"duration":5.71},{"text":"non-linearity it would look like a","start":1225.19,"duration":4.26},{"text":"single layer neural network and a single","start":1227.08,"duration":5.719},{"text":"layer neural net or what can you do","start":1229.45,"duration":3.349},{"text":"scaling translation rotation the","start":1234.78,"duration":11.91},{"text":"reflection and I guess shearing right","start":1242.53,"duration":6.69},{"text":"okay so I guess what's going to be the","start":1246.69,"duration":8.109},{"text":"next part of this class let's let's","start":1249.22,"duration":7.89},{"text":"check how one one linear one network","start":1254.799,"duration":4.711},{"text":"with one layer works okay questions so","start":1257.11,"duration":8.28},{"text":"far also there in the yeah for just","start":1259.51,"duration":8.549},{"text":"displaying stuff on the screen more","start":1265.39,"duration":4.62},{"text":"questions again don't raise hands you","start":1268.059,"duration":7.141},{"text":"can just talk to me can you hear me the","start":1270.01,"duration":5.789},{"text":"over there","start":1275.2,"duration":3.78},{"text":"is everything okay awesome alright thank","start":1275.799,"duration":6.021},{"text":"you for approval","start":1278.98,"duration":2.84},{"text":"so these two points here represent the","start":1286.24,"duration":4.9},{"text":"coordinates of my input points right so","start":1289.19,"duration":3.599},{"text":"this is gonna be my x-coordinate my","start":1291.14,"duration":4.56},{"text":"y-coordinate of the input space this

is","start":2466.83,"duration":4.65},{"text":"what's happening it's gonna kill one","start":2470.339,"duration":2.851},{"text":"dimension this one didn't kill it

get","start":2492.39,"duration":3.57},{"text":"this stuff here Oh something else hold","start":2493.77,"duration":5.01},{"text":"on so here you have blue green yellow","start":2495.96,"duration":6.54},{"text":"red right so our our G alone no there is","start":2498.78,"duration":5.22},{"text":"no order here we have blue green yellow","start":2502.5,"duration":4.609},{"text":"red and then here you have blue red","start":2504.0,"duration":5.4},{"text":"yellow green so what's happened here","start":2507.109,"duration":6.161},{"text":"how's the determinant negative why is","start":2509.4,"duration":9.66},{"text":"that because you had a reflection

things right so you have","start":2521.88,"duration":4.56},{"text":"more potatoes here and this is actually","start":2524.82,"duration":4.43},{"text":"zooming a lot you have one point three","start":2526.44,"duration":6.02},{"text":"this also is kind of zooming a little","start":2529.25,"duration":7.45},{"text":"okay this one does nothing okay","start":2532.46,"duration":7.87},{"text":"boring right oh okay what's happen here","start":2536.7,"duration":8.13},{"text":"how are these metrics it's gonna be","start":2540.33,"duration":6.09},{"text":"singular right almost you can see the","start":2544.83,"duration":3.269},{"text":"one singular value is gonna be zero","start":2546.42,"duration":3.57},{"text":"point zero three it's very tiny you can","start":2548.099,"duration":3.661},{"text":"see these are the unit vectors there

6","start":2553.98,"duration":4.44},{"text":"the other one is 0 0 3 so you can","start":2556.29,"duration":5.12},{"text":"basically almost killed a dimension

then","start":2584.269,"duration":5.911},{"text":"linear means doesn't mean a linear","start":2587.089,"duration":5.45},{"text":"transformation because these people were","start":2590.18,"duration":5.76},{"text":"guest programmers so you know they don't","start":2592.539,"duration":5.591},{"text":"know I guess this is an

said","start":2600.14,"duration":3.389},{"text":"bias equals false okay so this is","start":2601.279,"duration":4.441},{"text":"actually just a matrix multiplication so","start":2603.529,"duration":4.29},{"text":"it is a linear transformation okay maps","start":2605.72,"duration":5.46},{"text":"to 0 to 0 then I do model to device I","start":2607.819,"duration":6.151},{"text":"ship the model to the memory of the GPU","start":2611.18,"duration":5.25},{"text":"and then I remove the gradients you're","start":2613.97,"duration":3.96},{"text":"gonna figure out this next week what it","start":2616.43,"duration":5.369},{"text":"is I'm gonna bet get here my Y is gonna","start":2617.93,"duration":6.089},{"text":"be the output of the model to which I","start":2621.799,"duration":5.28},{"text":"input the X then I generate my figure","start":2624.019,"duration":5.611},{"text":"and I plot this stuff so this is to show","start":2627.079,"duration":5.91},{"text":"you that you can also get a

right I mean you can see","start":2636.819,"duration":5.95},{"text":"you can multiply data by matrix matrices","start":2640.039,"duration":5.611},{"text":"by using the PI torch package and so we","start":2642.769,"duration":5.461},{"text":"had to create a model sequential","start":2645.65,"duration":4.409},{"text":"container we put inside the

why","start":2651.92,"duration":5.129},{"text":"did I remove the translation because","start":2654.92,"duration":4.409},{"text":"otherwise I had to fetch it and it goes","start":2657.049,"duration":3.99},{"text":"outside the screen so I keep it in the","start":2659.329,"duration":7.141},{"text":"center okay all right so let's have this","start":2661.039,"duration":7.83},{"text":"one so right now I'm gonna just use the","start":2666.47,"duration":5.43},{"text":"following I just use a matrix that is I","start":2668.869,"duration":5.761},{"text":"think I didn't pick curl no it's gonna","start":2671.9,"duration":6.27},{"text":"be identity matrix which I scale both","start":2674.63,"duration":5.76},{"text":"items in the diagonal by the same item","start":2678.17,"duration":5.099},{"text":"by the same value and then I apply a","start":2680.39,"duration":4.8},{"text":"nonlinear function so my nonlinear","start":2683.269,"duration":3.691},{"text":"function is gonna be the following it's","start":2685.19,"duration":6.27},{"text":"a hyperbolic tangent which goes to minus","start":2686.96,"duration":7.77},{"text":"1 roughly when you cross the minus 2.5","start":2691.46,"duration":6.26},{"text":"here at the bottom and it goes to to put","start":2694.73,"duration":7.34},{"text":"goes to one roughly whenever you cross","start":2697.72,"duration":8.34},{"text":"the plus 2.5 okay up here so this stuff","start":2702.07,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Maps what the whole real line to wear

the","start":2715.9,"duration":6.36},{"text":"linear region which is roughly minus two","start":2719.05,"duration":5.7},{"text":"point five to two point five why do I","start":2722.26,"duration":3.87},{"text":"mention this name in these numbers","start":2724.75,"duration":2.88},{"text":"because sometimes you're gonna put your","start":2726.13,"duration":4.11},{"text":"nose inside your model it is not","start":2727.63,"duration":4.59},{"text":"training and you still want to figure","start":2730.24,"duration":4.59},{"text":"out the order of magnitude and you know","start":2732.22,"duration":4.83},{"text":"the rough the number which are kind of","start":2734.83,"duration":3.81},{"text":"associated to the kink of these","start":2737.05,"duration":4.95},{"text":"nonlinearities anyhow so I just create","start":2738.64,"duration":6.27},{"text":"this one which is very very similar to","start":2742.0,"duration":6.75},{"text":"the thing I just show you before which","start":2744.91,"duration":8.28},{"text":"has where is it here so here I have my","start":2748.75,"duration":6.26},{"text":"sequential which is the sequence of","start":2753.19,"duration":5.159},{"text":"operations I use a matrix first so this","start":2755.01,"duration":5.38},{"text":"linear to two then I applied the tonnage","start":2758.349,"duration":5.131},{"text":"and then I increased the I think the","start":2760.39,"duration":6.36},{"text":"multiplier for that diagonal matrix so","start":2763.48,"duration":5.31},{"text":"that's what you get so this is my cloud","start":2766.75,"duration":6.51},{"text":"what do you expect to see of my cloud so","start":2768.79,"duration":7.829},{"text":"what is the range of this cloud we said","start":2773.26,"duration":7.05},{"text":"it's roughly it goes from minus 3 to","start":2776.619,"duration":8.72},{"text":"plus 3 right where is the kink happening","start":2780.31,"duration":5.029},{"text":"so everything that is outside these two","start":2785.49,"duration":6.609},{"text":"point five minus two point five two plus","start":2789.73,"duration":5.91},{"text":"two point five box is going to be mapped","start":2792.099,"duration":8.971},{"text":"to one things that are inside stay","start":2795.64,"duration":8.58},{"text":"roughly the same that's correct so what","start":2801.07,"duration":5.279},{"text":"do you expect to see after this image","start":2804.22,"duration":8.44},{"text":"over here you expect","start":2806.349,"duration":9.701},{"text":"to have inbox your data but what is","start":2812.66,"duration":10.05},{"text":"going to be the size of this box are you","start":2816.05,"duration":7.58},{"text":"sure","start":2822.71,"duration":4.38},{"text":"so the the suggestion was from minus two","start":2823.63,"duration":6.21},{"text":"point five to two point five","start":2827.09,"duration":5.31},{"text":"the box is going to be 2 minus 1 2 plus","start":2829.84,"duration":6.1},{"text":"1 so minus 1 minus 1 I mean all the box","start":2832.4,"duration":4.89},{"text":"from minus 1 to plus 1","start":2835.94,"duration":3.33},{"text":"but then the points inside are going to","start":2837.29,"duration":3.84},{"text":"be

five","start":2842.9,"duration":4.44},{"text":"are getting linearly squeezed and then","start":2844.43,"duration":5.94},{"text":"things outside at two point five number","start":2847.34,"duration":4.91},{"text":"are going to be squashed down to the","start":2850.37,"duration":4.83},{"text":"basically edge of this box okay are

just two people","start":2858.41,"duration":6.27},{"text":"just said that I mean are we excited","start":2862.64,"duration":6.78},{"text":"come on give me some satisfaction okay","start":2864.68,"duration":6.09},{"text":"you're not playing with me","start":2869.42,"duration":5.01},{"text":"okay I see I'm trying to be nice to

oh","start":3037.48,"duration":7.619},{"text":"this is all right this is very spiky so","start":3042.339,"duration":4.26},{"text":"you're gonna figure out in the

neural","start":129.59,"duration":4.15},{"text":"network with the input on the bottom","start":132.15,"duration":3.12},{"text":"then we had like an affine","start":133.74,"duration":3.06},{"text":"transformation then we have a hidden","start":135.27,"duration":3.24},{"text":"layer right so I'm gonna just write the","start":136.8,"duration":3.96},{"text":"first equation we're gonna have that my","start":138.51,"duration":4.77},{"text":"hidden layer and since I'm writing

case","start":164.25,"duration":4.709},{"text":"I'm gonna be writing here Z is going to","start":166.23,"duration":8.759},{"text":"be equal to my matrix a times X okay we","start":168.959,"duration":8.221},{"text":"can imagine there is no bias in this","start":174.989,"duration":5.641},{"text":"case it's generic enough because we

B","start":183.09,"duration":10.619},{"text":"1 so if this X here belongs to RN and is","start":186.03,"duration":12.33},{"text":"dead here belongs to RM first question","start":193.709,"duration":9.06},{"text":"what is the size of this matrix okay","start":198.36,"duration":6.629},{"text":"fantastic right so this matrix here is","start":202.769,"duration":5.041},{"text":"gonna be our M times n you have as many","start":204.989,"duration":5.371},{"text":"rows as the dimension where you should -","start":207.81,"duration":4.5},{"text":"and you have as many columns the","start":210.36,"duration":3.84},{"text":"dimension where you're shooting from ok","start":212.31,"duration":5.16},{"text":"all right so let's expand this one right","start":214.2,"duration":5.73},{"text":"so this matrix here is gonna be equal to","start":217.47,"duration":7.17},{"text":"what do you have a 1 1 a 1 2 so on until","start":219.93,"duration":9.619},{"text":"the last one which is gonna be shout","start":224.64,"duration":8.209},{"text":"thank you 1","start":229.549,"duration":6.72},{"text":"and yeah 1n then you have second one's","start":232.849,"duration":8.821},{"text":"gonna have 1 a 2 1 a 2 2 so on until the","start":236.269,"duration":7.98},{"text":"last one which is 2 n right and then you","start":241.67,"duration":4.59},{"text":"keep going down until the last one which","start":244.249,"duration":10.591},{"text":"is going to be what are the indexes M 1","start":246.26,"duration":14.069},{"text":"right okay so you had a and 1 a M 2 and","start":254.84,"duration":9.9},{"text":"so on until amen okay thank you all","start":260.329,"duration":10.411},{"text":"right and then we have here our X right","start":264.74,"duration":12.48},{"text":"so you have X 1 X 2 and so on until xn","start":270.74,"duration":8.75},{"text":"right","start":277.22,"duration":2.27},{"text":"you're more responsive than last year","start":281.68,"duration":5.799},{"text":"good thank you alright so we can also","start":284.09,"duration":6.329},{"text":"rewrite this one in different ways so","start":287.479,"duration":4.62},{"text":"the first way I'm gonna write this one","start":290.419,"duration":4.861},{"text":"is gonna be the following so I'm gonna","start":292.099,"duration":7.921},{"text":"have here these a 1 then I'm gonna have","start":295.28,"duration":9.54},{"text":"here my a 2 and then I have the last one","start":300.02,"duration":12.389},{"text":"which is gonna be my a and ok and then","start":304.82,"duration":8.969},{"text":"here I'm gonna be multiplying this by a","start":312.409,"duration":3.391},{"text":"column vector right so my column vector","start":313.789,"duration":5.19},{"text":"I'm gonna be write it like this alright","start":315.8,"duration":7.609},{"text":"so what is the output of this operation","start":318.979,"duration":6.72},{"text":"so these are metrics you have a vector","start":323.409,"duration":5.411},{"text":"the outcome is going to be a vector so","start":325.699,"duration":4.801},{"text":"what is gonna be the first item of my","start":328.82,"duration":6.96},{"text":"vector I don't use dots because I'm not","start":330.5,"duration":7.05},{"text":"a physicist actually I am that we are","start":335.78,"duration":4.439},{"text":"doing linear algebra so what should I","start":337.55,"duration":4.85},{"text":"write","start":340.219,"duration":2.181},{"text":"alright so that's already transpose","start":343.81,"duration":3.699},{"text":"because those are a row vector so I just","start":345.889,"duration":3.78},{"text":"write a I'm gonna just mean just right","start":347.509,"duration":7.47},{"text":"right so I have a 1 X ok so there is no","start":349.669,"duration":7.981},{"text":"transposition here no dots around and so","start":354.979,"duration":7.801},{"text":"on second element is gonna be a two okay","start":357.65,"duration":7.77},{"text":"X and then until the last one which is","start":362.78,"duration":10.19},{"text":"gonna be D okay there's no dot but sure","start":365.42,"duration":10.32},{"text":"like someone is calling that dot product","start":372.97,"duration":4.84},{"text":"instead of the cross product but that is","start":375.74,"duration":3.929},{"text":"assumes like you use a different kind of","start":377.81,"duration":2.579},{"text":"notation","start":379.669,"duration":4.261},{"text":"all right so and this is gonna be my so","start":380.389,"duration":6.321},{"text":"how many elements does this vector have","start":383.93,"duration":7.17},{"text":"M okay so we have Z 1 Z 2 and so on","start":386.71,"duration":8.41},{"text":"until Z M and this is my final set right","start":391.1,"duration":7.319},{"text":"my vector is that okay fantastic so now","start":395.12,"duration":4.59},{"text":"we are going to be focusing a little bit","start":398.419,"duration":6.991},{"text":"about the meaning of this thing over","start":399.71,"duration":8.88},{"text":"here okay other questions so far","start":405.41,"duration":5.64},{"text":"all right this is very trivial so far I","start":408.59,"duration":5.94},{"text":"hope I mean let me know if if not okay","start":411.05,"duration":6.21},{"text":"okay so let's analyze one of these guys","start":414.53,"duration":5.61},{"text":"here so I'd like to figure out what is","start":417.26,"duration":8.969},{"text":"the meaning of writing a T times X right","start":420.14,"duration":10.83},{"text":"so my a T is gonna be my generic a I so","start":426.229,"duration":10.381},{"text":"let's assume in this case when n equal","start":430.97,"duration":13.71},{"text":"to okay so what is ATX so ATX is going","start":436.61,"duration":10.98},{"text":"to be equal to what so let me draw here","start":444.68,"duration":5.1},{"text":"something so that is gonna be easier for","start":447.59,"duration":4.11},{"text":"you to understand so this one is gonna","start":449.78,"duration":7.94},{"text":"be my a are these gonna be my alpha and","start":451.7,"duration":9.6},{"text":"then here you have like it's gonna be my","start":457.72,"duration":10.9},{"text":"X and is this gonna be here my X I so","start":461.3,"duration":9.78},{"text":"what is this what is the output of this","start":468.62,"duration":8.81},{"text":"product here these are here","start":471.08,"duration":6.35},{"text":"see you can sorry 8\/8 transpose it let's","start":478.21,"duration":10.26},{"text":"call it let's say that is a row vector","start":484.79,"duration":3.68},{"text":"can you see know what is gonna be the","start":490.03,"duration":17.85},{"text":"output of this operation here no why","start":496.73,"duration":11.15},{"text":"this is this is like a generic one of","start":509.41,"duration":5.2},{"text":"the many aids right there are M aids","start":512.51,"duration":4.8},{"text":"this is one of those mas so I'm","start":514.61,"duration":4.559},{"text":"multiplying one of those A's times my X","start":517.31,"duration":4.5},{"text":"right let's assume there are only two","start":519.169,"duration":4.141},{"text":"dimensions so what is gonna be the","start":521.81,"duration":4.29},{"text":"output of this scalar product can","start":523.31,"duration":7.35},{"text":"someone tell me no no no like normal","start":526.1,"duration":13.86},{"text":"scalar product hold on","start":530.66,"duration":12.06},{"text":"so you have egg hey here do you have","start":539.96,"duration":5.97},{"text":"here this part here is gonna be a 1 it","start":542.72,"duration":5.79},{"text":"is gonna be a two okay then you have","start":545.93,"duration":8.49},{"text":"here x1 and now you have x2 right so how","start":548.51,"duration":10.04},{"text":"do you express this scalar product here","start":554.42,"duration":4.13},{"text":"okay so I'm just writing let me know if","start":559.98,"duration":6.75},{"text":"you took clear so I'm gonna write here a","start":562.18,"duration":4.55},{"text":"1 times X 1 plus a 2 times X 2 right","start":568.89,"duration":8.89},{"text":"this is the definition clear right so","start":574.39,"duration":8.79},{"text":"far yeah no okay yeah question yeah that","start":577.78,"duration":7.05},{"text":"is meant to be a transpose Y a role","start":583.18,"duration":4.38},{"text":"times column vector so let's assume a is","start":584.83,"duration":4.77},{"text":"a column vector then I have role x","start":587.56,"duration":5.16},{"text":"colouring so let's keep writing this","start":589.6,"duration":12.63},{"text":"stuff here so what is a 1 how can i","start":592.72,"duration":20.19},{"text":"compute AI a 1 second ok ok","start":602.23,"duration":12.99},{"text":"so I'm gonna write here the a 1 is going","start":612.91,"duration":4.68},{"text":"to be the length of vector a times","start":615.22,"duration":5.55},{"text":"cosine alpha then what about X 1 someone","start":617.59,"duration":8.1},{"text":"else the same right now wait what what","start":620.77,"duration":9.24},{"text":"is X 1 same thing right different","start":625.69,"duration":9.75},{"text":"letters so someone say something you're","start":630.01,"duration":7.44},{"text":"following you're completely confused","start":635.44,"duration":4.83},{"text":"you're not having any idea it's too easy","start":637.45,"duration":5.76},{"text":"I have no idea what's going on here it's","start":640.27,"duration":4.62},{"text":"good right so far ok what's gonna be the","start":643.21,"duration":10.56},{"text":"second term the this one is gonna be X","start":644.89,"duration":14.13},{"text":"here write x cos x I right and then you","start":653.77,"duration":6.66},{"text":"had the second term which is going to be","start":659.02,"duration":9.71},{"text":"what magnitude of a shout I can hear ok","start":660.43,"duration":13.49},{"text":"sine of alpha and then","start":668.73,"duration":5.19},{"text":"okay thank you okay","start":677.66,"duration":3.63},{"text":"all right I'm gonna be just putting","start":683.93,"duration":3.94},{"text":"together those two guys so you're gonna","start":686.31,"duration":5.31},{"text":"get equal magnitude of a times magnitude","start":687.87,"duration":12.5},{"text":"of x times cosine alpha cosine Phi plus","start":691.62,"duration":15.09},{"text":"sana sine alpha and sine cosine a sine X","start":700.37,"duration":7.84},{"text":"I sorry","start":706.71,"duration":6.45},{"text":"what is be starting the parentheses all","start":708.21,"duration":6.0},{"text":"right so there's the cosine of the","start":713.16,"duration":2.16},{"text":"difference of the two angle right","start":714.21,"duration":3.03},{"text":"everyone knows trigonometry here right","start":715.32,"duration":4.74},{"text":"sorry high school stuff so this one is","start":717.24,"duration":7.92},{"text":"gonna be equal to a x times the cosine","start":720.06,"duration":9.39},{"text":"of cos x i minus alpha right oh the","start":725.16,"duration":5.84},{"text":"other way around right from monoxides","start":729.45,"duration":4.8},{"text":"so what does this mean you can think","start":731.0,"duration":6.04},{"text":"about each element so far is clear I I","start":734.25,"duration":5.52},{"text":"didn't do any magic yeah shake your head","start":737.04,"duration":5.64},{"text":"like these four yes these four no this","start":739.77,"duration":6.42},{"text":"for maybe no something's working okay so","start":742.68,"duration":5.13},{"text":"you can think about whenever you","start":746.19,"duration":4.56},{"text":"multiply a matrix times a vector that","start":747.81,"duration":5.79},{"text":"basically each output of this operation","start":750.75,"duration":6.72},{"text":"is gonna be measuring so okay hold on","start":753.6,"duration":5.97},{"text":"what is this cosine how much is cosine","start":757.47,"duration":5.85},{"text":"of zero one so it means if these two","start":759.57,"duration":6.21},{"text":"angles if the two vectors are aligned","start":763.32,"duration":4.47},{"text":"which means there is a zero angle","start":765.78,"duration":4.68},{"text":"between the two vectors you can have the","start":767.79,"duration":5.73},{"text":"maximum value of this element right","start":770.46,"duration":6.63},{"text":"whenever when you have the minus the","start":773.52,"duration":8.03},{"text":"most negative value when they are","start":777.09,"duration":6.15},{"text":"opposite right so when they're in","start":781.55,"duration":3.31},{"text":"opposition of phase you're gonna get the","start":783.24,"duration":5.07},{"text":"most negative magnitude but then if you","start":784.86,"duration":5.52},{"text":"apply just let's a redo you're gonna cut","start":788.31,"duration":3.42},{"text":"all those negative things you're just","start":790.38,"duration":3.33},{"text":"checking for the positive matches right","start":791.73,"duration":4.47},{"text":"so neural net basically just perhaps","start":793.71,"duration":4.53},{"text":"who's gonna be figuring out only the","start":796.2,"duration":4.32},{"text":"positive matches right and so again when","start":798.24,"duration":3.66},{"text":"you multiply a matrix times a column","start":800.52,"duration":3.1},{"text":"vector you","start":801.9,"duration":5.439},{"text":"be performing element-wise sorry scalar","start":803.62,"duration":7.71},{"text":"product between each column each row of","start":807.339,"duration":6.871},{"text":"the matrix which represents your kernel","start":811.33,"duration":4.89},{"text":"right so whenever you have like a linear","start":814.21,"duration":3.6},{"text":"layer your kernel is gonna be the whole","start":816.22,"duration":3.78},{"text":"row of the matrix and now you see what","start":817.81,"duration":5.55},{"text":"is the projection of that input on that","start":820.0,"duration":7.05},{"text":"column I am on the input on that flow","start":823.36,"duration":6.75},{"text":"right so each element of this product is","start":827.05,"duration":5.85},{"text":"going to tell you the alignment with","start":830.11,"duration":5.55},{"text":"which the input is what is the alignment","start":832.9,"duration":4.68},{"text":"of the input with respect to the","start":835.66,"duration":4.41},{"text":"specific row of the matrix okay","start":837.58,"duration":7.02},{"text":"yes no this should shape some more like","start":840.07,"duration":6.019},{"text":"intuition while we are using these","start":844.6,"duration":3.69},{"text":"linear transformations they are like","start":846.089,"duration":4.781},{"text":"allowing you to see the projection of","start":848.29,"duration":4.85},{"text":"the input onto different kind of","start":850.87,"duration":9.27},{"text":"orientations let's say this way okay you","start":853.14,"duration":9.16},{"text":"can try to you know extrapolate this in","start":860.14,"duration":4.199},{"text":"high dimensions I guess the intuition at","start":862.3,"duration":3.84},{"text":"least I can give it to you works","start":864.339,"duration":3.351},{"text":"definitely in two and three dimensions","start":866.14,"duration":4.44},{"text":"in higher dimensions I kind of think it","start":867.69,"duration":5.26},{"text":"works in a similar way next lesson we","start":870.58,"duration":3.629},{"text":"are going to watch we are actually we","start":872.95,"duration":3.509},{"text":"are going to see how what is the","start":874.209,"duration":4.681},{"text":"distribution of the projections in a","start":876.459,"duration":4.561},{"text":"higher dimensional space is this sort","start":878.89,"duration":4.35},{"text":"gonna be so cool I think all right so","start":881.02,"duration":4.23},{"text":"this was the first part of I think of","start":883.24,"duration":6.539},{"text":"the class oh well there is one more more","start":885.25,"duration":8.31},{"text":"part so actually here this said here we","start":889.779,"duration":5.161},{"text":"can also write it in a different way so","start":893.56,"duration":3.96},{"text":"maybe this is maybe it's known maybe","start":894.94,"duration":5.19},{"text":"it's not known when I saw it first time","start":897.52,"duration":5.009},{"text":"I didn't know so you know it's it's cool","start":900.13,"duration":4.92},{"text":"that sometimes you see these things once","start":902.529,"duration":5.701},{"text":"again maybe so let's go back here is the","start":905.05,"duration":5.4},{"text":"things that there and so you can express","start":908.23,"duration":8.19},{"text":"this Z as being equal the vector a 1 in","start":910.45,"duration":8.37},{"text":"this case a 1 is gonna be the first","start":916.42,"duration":5.1},{"text":"column of the a matrix ok and this one","start":918.82,"duration":4.01},{"text":"is going to be multiplied by the scalar","start":921.52,"duration":4.35},{"text":"x1 now you have the second column of the","start":922.83,"duration":6.55},{"text":"matrix so I have a 2 this is multiplied","start":925.87,"duration":5.159},{"text":"by the second element of the X right","start":929.38,"duration":5.49},{"text":"until the last one which is gonna be","start":931.029,"duration":10.601},{"text":"again I can't hear if it's M or n m like","start":934.87,"duration":10.06},{"text":"this or end you know sign language which","start":941.63,"duration":7.71},{"text":"one n right you know sign language no","start":944.93,"duration":7.95},{"text":"you should learn it's good you know","start":949.34,"duration":6.9},{"text":"inclusivity a and write the last column","start":952.88,"duration":6.75},{"text":"times your X and of course because n X","start":956.24,"duration":5.67},{"text":"has a size of n there are n items right","start":959.63,"duration":4.47},{"text":"and so basically when you also when you","start":961.91,"duration":4.23},{"text":"do a you know transformation a linear","start":964.1,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you know apply a linear operator you","start":966.14,"duration":3.84},{"text":"can't be basically waiting each column","start":967.94,"duration":4.95},{"text":"of the matrix with the coefficient that","start":969.98,"duration":5.19},{"text":"is in a you know you have first column","start":972.89,"duration":3.75},{"text":"times the first coefficient of the","start":975.17,"duration":3.93},{"text":"vector second column and by the second","start":976.64,"duration":5.49},{"text":"item plus third column times the third","start":979.1,"duration":4.89},{"text":"item and so you can see the output of","start":982.13,"duration":4.29},{"text":"this DN transformation is a weighted sum","start":983.99,"duration":6.84},{"text":"of the columns of the a matrix okay so","start":986.42,"duration":5.76},{"text":"this is a different kind of intuition","start":990.83,"duration":3.81},{"text":"sometimes you see these as like whenever","start":992.18,"duration":4.44},{"text":"you want to express your signal your","start":994.64,"duration":7.11},{"text":"data is a combination of different you","start":996.62,"duration":8.67},{"text":"know the composition this is kind of a","start":1001.75,"duration":6.3},{"text":"linear composition of your input alright","start":1005.29,"duration":5.31},{"text":"so that was the first part it is the","start":1008.05,"duration":5.85},{"text":"recap about the linear algebra a second","start":1010.6,"duration":6.93},{"text":"part is going to be something even more","start":1013.9,"duration":5.93},{"text":"cool I think questions so far","start":1017.53,"duration":9.26},{"text":"no easy too easy you're getting bored","start":1019.83,"duration":9.97},{"text":"sorry okay all right then I'm gonna","start":1026.79,"duration":3.88},{"text":"speed up I guess","start":1029.8,"duration":3.539},{"text":"alright so let's see how we can extend","start":1030.67,"duration":4.5},{"text":"the one that the stuff we have seen","start":1033.339,"duration":4.291},{"text":"right now to convolutions right so maybe","start":1035.17,"duration":3.87},{"text":"convolution sometimes are a little bit","start":1037.63,"duration":3.69},{"text":"weird let's see how we can do an","start":1039.04,"duration":9.86},{"text":"extension to convolutions","start":1041.32,"duration":7.58},{"text":"all right so let's say I start with the","start":1051.72,"duration":6.67},{"text":"same matrix so I'm gonna have here four","start":1054.94,"duration":11.19},{"text":"rows and then three columns okay so my","start":1058.39,"duration":15.27},{"text":"data has to be if I had if I had this","start":1066.13,"duration":10.44},{"text":"matrix if I multiply this to a column my","start":1073.66,"duration":5.7},{"text":"column vector should be of size three","start":1076.57,"duration":5.609},{"text":"thank you all right so let me draw here","start":1079.36,"duration":4.89},{"text":"my column vector of size right and this","start":1082.179,"duration":5.671},{"text":"is gonna give you a output of size four","start":1084.25,"duration":4.559},{"text":"okay fantastic","start":1087.85,"duration":3.66},{"text":"but then is your data let's say you're","start":1088.809,"duration":6.931},{"text":"gonna listen to some nice audio audio","start":1091.51,"duration":6.75},{"text":"file is your data just three simple long","start":1095.74,"duration":5.52},{"text":"how long is gonna be your data let's say","start":1098.26,"duration":5.28},{"text":"you listening to a piece of music that","start":1101.26,"duration":3.33},{"text":"is like three minutes","start":1103.54,"duration":3.54},{"text":"how many sample does three minutes of","start":1104.59,"duration":7.74},{"text":"all your health yeah I guess what is","start":1107.08,"duration":9.479},{"text":"gonna be my sampling rate let's say","start":1112.33,"duration":7.74},{"text":"twenty two okay twenty two thousand kilo","start":1116.559,"duration":6.24},{"text":"Hertz right 22 kilohertz so how many","start":1120.07,"duration":6.41},{"text":"samples three minutes of music have","start":1122.799,"duration":3.681},{"text":"second you sure is monophonic","start":1127.799,"duration":10.211},{"text":"or stereophonic just kidding okay so","start":1135.28,"duration":4.29},{"text":"you're gonna multiply the number of","start":1138.01,"duration":4.64},{"text":"sample the number of seconds right","start":1139.57,"duration":6.84},{"text":"number of seconds times the frame rate","start":1142.65,"duration":6.01},{"text":"right the okay the frequency in this","start":1146.41,"duration":4.23},{"text":"case anyhow so this signal is gonna be","start":1148.66,"duration":3.96},{"text":"very very long right it's gonna be keep","start":1150.64,"duration":4.59},{"text":"going down so if I have a vector that is","start":1152.62,"duration":4.32},{"text":"very very long I have I have to use a","start":1155.23,"duration":5.79},{"text":"matrix which is gonna be very very fat","start":1156.94,"duration":6.6},{"text":"wide right okay fantastic so this top","start":1161.02,"duration":4.08},{"text":"keeps going this direction","start":1163.54,"duration":3.54},{"text":"alright so my question for you is gonna","start":1165.1,"duration":3.99},{"text":"be what should I put in this location","start":1167.08,"duration":4.46},{"text":"here","start":1169.09,"duration":2.45},{"text":"what should I put here so do we care","start":1175.57,"duration":12.45},{"text":"about things that are further away","start":1183.89,"duration":4.13},{"text":"no why not","start":1188.74,"duration":5.26},{"text":"because our data has the property of","start":1190.61,"duration":6.03},{"text":"locality fantastic so what am I gonna go","start":1194.0,"duration":6.299},{"text":"what am I gonna be putting here a big","start":1196.64,"duration":6.99},{"text":"zero right fantastic mom okay so we put","start":1200.299,"duration":6.391},{"text":"a zero here and then what is the other","start":1203.63,"duration":4.59},{"text":"property so let me start drawing this","start":1206.69,"duration":3.119},{"text":"stuff again right so can I have my","start":1208.22,"duration":5.64},{"text":"kernel of size three and then here I","start":1209.809,"duration":7.081},{"text":"have my data which is gonna be very long","start":1213.86,"duration":14.939},{"text":"right so hold on I can see all right so","start":1216.89,"duration":14.279},{"text":"here there are zero then let's say what","start":1228.799,"duration":5.01},{"text":"is the other property my my my date my","start":1231.169,"duration":5.791},{"text":"natural data have stationarity which","start":1233.809,"duration":9.36},{"text":"means the pattern that you expect to","start":1236.96,"duration":8.099},{"text":"find this can be kind of repeating over","start":1243.169,"duration":4.051},{"text":"and over again right and so if I have","start":1245.059,"duration":4.081},{"text":"here my three values here perhaps I'd","start":1247.22,"duration":4.14},{"text":"like to reuse them over and over again","start":1249.14,"duration":4.649},{"text":"right and so if these three values let","start":1251.36,"duration":4.949},{"text":"me change the color maybe so you can see","start":1253.789,"duration":6.99},{"text":"in there is the same stuff so I have","start":1256.309,"duration":7.771},{"text":"three values here and then I'm gonna be","start":1260.779,"duration":6.451},{"text":"using these three same values one step","start":1264.08,"duration":6.15},{"text":"for the rain and I keep going further I","start":1267.23,"duration":9.54},{"text":"don't down and I keep going this way all","start":1270.23,"duration":8.13},{"text":"right so what should I put here on the","start":1276.77,"duration":6.029},{"text":"bottom what should I put here a zero","start":1278.36,"duration":7.25},{"text":"right why that why is that because of","start":1282.799,"duration":5.73},{"text":"locality of the data right so putting","start":1285.61,"duration":9.039},{"text":"zeros around is called it's also called","start":1288.529,"duration":7.821},{"text":"padding but in this case it's called","start":1294.649,"duration":5.63},{"text":"sparsity right so this is like sparsity","start":1296.35,"duration":8.5},{"text":"and then the replication of this thing","start":1300.279,"duration":6.781},{"text":"that is over and over over again","start":1304.85,"duration":7.88},{"text":"it's called session I'd was the property","start":1307.06,"duration":7.8},{"text":"of the signal this is called weight","start":1312.73,"duration":4.7},{"text":"sharing yeah","start":1314.86,"duration":2.57},{"text":"okay fantastic all right so how many how","start":1324.33,"duration":5.76},{"text":"many values do we have now how many","start":1328.8,"duration":4.73},{"text":"parameters I have on the right hand side","start":1330.09,"duration":3.44},{"text":"well so we have three parameters over","start":1335.15,"duration":7.6},{"text":"left on the left hand side instead we","start":1341.1,"duration":6.0},{"text":"had product right so if the right side","start":1342.75,"duration":6.15},{"text":"is gonna be easy is the right side gonna","start":1347.1,"duration":7.47},{"text":"work at whole you have three parameters","start":1348.9,"duration":7.91},{"text":"one side on the other side you have 12","start":1354.57,"duration":5.19},{"text":"okay that is good using locality and","start":1356.81,"duration":5.05},{"text":"spiral and whatever not like sparsity","start":1359.76,"duration":4.05},{"text":"and parameter sharing but then now we","start":1361.86,"duration":3.75},{"text":"end up with just three parameters isn't","start":1363.81,"duration":4.5},{"text":"this too restrictive how can we have","start":1365.61,"duration":5.58},{"text":"multiple multiple parameter what's","start":1368.31,"duration":6.21},{"text":"missing here in the big picture there","start":1371.19,"duration":5.1},{"text":"are multiple channels right so this is","start":1374.52,"duration":4.92},{"text":"just one layer here and then you have","start":1376.29,"duration":5.28},{"text":"this stuff coming out from the from the","start":1379.44,"duration":3.99},{"text":"from the board here so you have the","start":1381.57,"duration":6.66},{"text":"first kernel down here now he has some","start":1383.43,"duration":11.19},{"text":"second kernel let's say listen and I","start":1388.23,"duration":12.27},{"text":"have last one here right and so you have","start":1394.62,"duration":8.49},{"text":"each plane of these metrics being","start":1400.5,"duration":4.26},{"text":"containing just one kernel which is","start":1403.11,"duration":4.86},{"text":"replicated multiple times who knows the","start":1404.76,"duration":11.43},{"text":"name of this matrix now so this is gonna","start":1407.97,"duration":12.68},{"text":"be called triplets top list matrix","start":1416.19,"duration":4.46},{"text":"okay so what is the main feature of","start":1423.419,"duration":4.8},{"text":"these topless metrics what is the big","start":1426.089,"duration":7.56},{"text":"big big thing that you won't notice it's","start":1428.219,"duration":13.26},{"text":"a sparse matrix okay okay what is gonna","start":1433.649,"duration":11.551},{"text":"be here this first item over here what","start":1441.479,"duration":14.67},{"text":"is the content of the first guy yeah so","start":1445.2,"duration":13.139},{"text":"this one here is gonna be the extension","start":1456.149,"duration":5.52},{"text":"of my linear transformation which was","start":1458.339,"duration":5.52},{"text":"you know I have a signal that is longer","start":1461.669,"duration":4.5},{"text":"than three samples therefore I have to","start":1463.859,"duration":5.37},{"text":"make this matrix fatter second part is","start":1466.169,"duration":6.06},{"text":"might be given that I don't care about","start":1469.229,"duration":5.25},{"text":"what things like things that are here","start":1472.229,"duration":3.9},{"text":"down I don't care about things that are","start":1474.479,"duration":3.51},{"text":"here if I look at the points that are up","start":1476.129,"duration":4.17},{"text":"here so gonna be putting a big 0 here","start":1477.989,"duration":4.32},{"text":"such that Oh everything that is down","start":1480.299,"duration":4.771},{"text":"here it gets cleaned up right and then","start":1482.309,"duration":4.44},{"text":"finally I'm gonna be using the same","start":1485.07,"duration":4.829},{"text":"kernel over and over again because I","start":1486.749,"duration":6.571},{"text":"assume that my data is stationary and","start":1489.899,"duration":5.94},{"text":"therefore I assume that similar patterns","start":1493.32,"duration":4.079},{"text":"are gonna be happening over and over","start":1495.839,"duration":3.09},{"text":"again therefore I'm gonna be using this","start":1497.399,"duration":3.421},{"text":"one which is written here parameter","start":1498.929,"duration":4.5},{"text":"sharing weight sharing","start":1500.82,"duration":5.009},{"text":"finally given that this one gives you","start":1503.429,"duration":4.59},{"text":"only three parameter two parameters to","start":1505.829,"duration":5.13},{"text":"work with I will use several layers in","start":1508.019,"duration":4.921},{"text":"order to have different you know","start":1510.959,"duration":4.44},{"text":"channels so this one is one kernel","start":1512.94,"duration":4.799},{"text":"before one kernel was the whole row of","start":1515.399,"duration":4.62},{"text":"the matrix okay so when you have a fully","start":1517.739,"duration":4.11},{"text":"connected layer the only difference","start":1520.019,"duration":3.301},{"text":"between a fully connected layer and a","start":1521.849,"duration":3.33},{"text":"convolution is that you have the full","start":1523.32,"duration":7.709},{"text":"dam row of the matrix so what is gonna","start":1525.179,"duration":11.84},{"text":"be in this first item over here anyone","start":1531.029,"duration":5.99},{"text":"so the green colonel let's call the","start":1538.48,"duration":4.75},{"text":"green corner just a one let me actually","start":1540.77,"duration":4.409},{"text":"make it glow green because it's green","start":1543.23,"duration":11.97},{"text":"karna so you have a one times what it's","start":1545.179,"duration":11.461},{"text":"gonna be from the number one to number","start":1555.2,"duration":3.69},{"text":"three right and then the second item is","start":1556.64,"duration":6.12},{"text":"gonna be same same dude here a 1 and","start":1558.89,"duration":6.75},{"text":"then you're gonna have the X shifted by","start":1562.76,"duration":15.659},{"text":"one and so on right make sense yeah and","start":1565.64,"duration":14.399},{"text":"then we're gonna have this one is going","start":1578.419,"duration":2.851},{"text":"to be the green output then you're gonna","start":1580.039,"duration":3.931},{"text":"have the blue output one layer coming","start":1581.27,"duration":4.17},{"text":"out and then you have the further one","start":1583.97,"duration":2.76},{"text":"the red one coming","start":1585.44,"duration":5.219},{"text":"we've been one layer out okay what's the","start":1586.73,"duration":6.199},{"text":"iPad experience cool","start":1590.659,"duration":9.861},{"text":"yes no I liked it okay other questions","start":1592.929,"duration":7.591},{"text":"so again the blue circle this one it's a","start":1601.029,"duration":8.02},{"text":"big zero","start":1608.419,"duration":5.061},{"text":"that's the sparsity one the same is here","start":1609.049,"duration":4.431},{"text":"yes no yeah yeah","start":1613.899,"duration":4.621},{"text":"yeah green so here I just put a lot of","start":1621.53,"duration":14.67},{"text":"zeros inside here so I killed all the","start":1634.01,"duration":4.29},{"text":"values that are away from the little","start":1636.2,"duration":4.8},{"text":"part and then I repeat the same

said","start":1647.45,"duration":7.29},{"text":"that in this case I'm gonna have just","start":1653.36,"duration":3.48},{"text":"three values right and we started with","start":1654.74,"duration":4.14},{"text":"12 values and I ended up with 3 which is","start":1656.84,"duration":4.2},{"text":"really really little so if I'd like to","start":1658.88,"duration":4.44},{"text":"have let's say 6 values then if I want","start":1661.04,"duration":3.72},{"text":"to have six values and I can have

zeros","start":1677.29,"duration":10.15},{"text":"that's it yeah so they're gonna have","start":1678.77,"duration":10.83},{"text":"this one here then you have a second one","start":1687.44,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you have a third one so you have three","start":1689.6,"duration":5.19},{"text":"versions of the input alright so for a","start":1691.28,"duration":4.86},{"text":"second part of the class I'm gonna be","start":1694.79,"duration":3.21},{"text":"showing you some more interactive

the","start":1786.66,"duration":5.54},{"text":"top here","start":1789.69,"duration":2.51},{"text":"alright so given the assumption of","start":1792.89,"duration":4.06},{"text":"locality stationarity

that","start":1832.59,"duration":4.589},{"text":"professor here at NYU made and here I'm","start":1834.27,"duration":5.61},{"text":"gonna be just loading my audio data and","start":1837.179,"duration":5.13},{"text":"I'm gonna have that in my X and then my","start":1839.88,"duration":3.72},{"text":"sampling grade is going to be","start":1842.309,"duration":3.691},{"text":"in the other variable so here I'll just","start":1843.6,"duration":4.97},{"text":"show you I'm gonna have like 70,000","start":1846.0,"duration":5.67},{"text":"samples in this case because I have a","start":1848.57,"duration":5.86},{"text":"simple in rate of 22 kilo Hertz and then","start":1851.67,"duration":5.91},{"text":"my total time is gonna be three seconds","start":1854.43,"duration":7.29},{"text":"okay so three seconds times 22 you get","start":1857.58,"duration":7.68},{"text":"what so it's not 180 you were saying it","start":1861.72,"duration":5.19},{"text":"was a hundred and eighty was three right","start":1865.26,"duration":4.41},{"text":"oh it was three minutes oh you're right","start":1866.91,"duration":4.47},{"text":"it's three seconds so you actually are","start":1869.67,"duration":4.05},{"text":"correct my dad so this is three seconds","start":1871.38,"duration":5.16},{"text":"so times 22 kilo Hertz you get 17","start":1873.72,"duration":7.26},{"text":"roughly some 70,000 samples here I'm","start":1876.54,"duration":5.85},{"text":"gonna be important some libraries to","start":1880.98,"duration":3.95},{"text":"show you something and then I'm gonna be","start":1882.39,"duration":5.79},{"text":"showing you the first chart so this is","start":1884.93,"duration":5.56},{"text":"the audio signal I have imported right","start":1888.18,"duration":9.09},{"text":"now how does it look like wavy okay cool","start":1890.49,"duration":15.03},{"text":"can you tell me how it sounds that was a","start":1897.27,"duration":13.41},{"text":"good guess the guess was you can tell is","start":1905.52,"duration":7.02},{"text":"actually what's the content right from","start":1910.68,"duration":4.77},{"text":"this diagram because the amplitude of","start":1912.54,"duration":6.6},{"text":"like the the the y-axis here is gonna be","start":1915.45,"duration":5.79},{"text":"showing you just the amplitude can I","start":1919.14,"duration":5.28},{"text":"turn off the light is okay or you're you","start":1921.24,"duration":4.29},{"text":"sure okay thank you","start":1924.42,"duration":6.84},{"text":"I really

anything","start":1936.09,"duration":3.84},{"text":"here right","start":1938.91,"duration":3.66},{"text":"you can't not tell what is the what is","start":1939.93,"duration":6.65},{"text":"the sound right so how can we figure out","start":1942.57,"duration":7.23},{"text":"what is the sound inside here so for","start":1946.58,"duration":5.29},{"text":"example I can show you a transcript over","start":1949.8,"duration":5.28},{"text":"the sound and actually let me let me","start":1951.87,"duration":5.79},{"text":"actually force these in your in your","start":1955.08,"duration":6.44},{"text":"your head right so you're gonna have","start":1957.66,"duration":7.15},{"text":"hold on your network","start":1961.52,"duration":6.81},{"text":"all right so now we actually heard it","start":1964.81,"duration":5.8},{"text":"okay so now you can actually see ting","start":1968.33,"duration":5.43},{"text":"ting ting boom you know you can kind of","start":1970.61,"duration":5.79},{"text":"imagine a little bit but okay so what","start":1973.76,"duration":5.07},{"text":"notes did we play there like how can I","start":1976.4,"duration":4.43},{"text":"figure out what put out the notes that","start":1978.83,"duration":4.44},{"text":"they are inside so I'm gonna be showing","start":1980.83,"duration":4.72},{"text":"this one so since this is a bit brighter","start":1983.27,"duration":4.74},{"text":"I can see your faces how many of you can","start":1985.55,"duration":8.27},{"text":"not read this oh ouch","start":1988.01,"duration":16.83},{"text":"okay so let me let me see if I can help","start":1993.82,"duration":42.31},{"text":"us out here okay the connection would","start":2004.84,"duration":37.65},{"text":"help please alright let me try to thank","start":2036.13,"duration":10.22},{"text":"you all right","start":2042.49,"duration":3.86},{"text":"how cool is that thank you it took four","start":2054.44,"duration":13.55},{"text":"lessons for you to clap nice oh now","start":2064.74,"duration":7.0},{"text":"this is very nice of you let's keep","start":2067.99,"duration":9.03},{"text":"going and you fly because between the","start":2071.74,"duration":9.71},{"text":"first a frequencies is that the first a","start":2077.02,"duration":7.53},{"text":"thin flap maybe twice the frequency as","start":2081.45,"duration":8.62},{"text":"the other figure out what is the","start":2084.55,"duration":7.289},{"text":"frequency of that and then we're gonna","start":2090.07,"duration":7.35},{"text":"be sine is that we have vehicle payment","start":2091.839,"duration":7.861},{"text":"and so we're gonna have a a flap in our","start":2097.42,"duration":4.97},{"text":"shop","start":2099.7,"duration":2.69},{"text":"so if we put all together we gonna get","start":2104.96,"duration":5.22},{"text":"season","start":2107.7,"duration":2.48},{"text":"all right simple no yep thank you","start":2111.2,"duration":7.619},{"text":"bye-bye okay","start":2113.849,"duration":7.74},{"text":"seeing this took a whole damn day to","start":2118.819,"duration":4.721},{"text":"prepare","start":2121.589,"duration":10.981},{"text":"I was so nervous before come here I'm so","start":2123.54,"duration":10.95},{"text":"happy now I can actually go to sleep","start":2132.57,"duration":2.43},{"text":"later","start":2134.49,"duration":4.8},{"text":"anyhow so this was like in the first","start":2135.0,"duration":6.27},{"text":"part you're gonna have the first note","start":2139.29,"duration":3.99},{"text":"there's a flap that you have a b-flat","start":2141.27,"duration":7.71},{"text":"a-flat and B so you have the and the","start":2143.28,"duration":8.27},{"text":"difference between the first pitch and","start":2148.98,"duration":5.55},{"text":"is one octave there for the first","start":2151.55,"duration":5.89},{"text":"frequency is gonna be twice the second","start":2154.53,"duration":5.07},{"text":"frequency okay so whenever we're gonna","start":2157.44,"duration":5.43},{"text":"be observing the waveform one sign will","start":2159.6,"duration":6.39},{"text":"have to a shorter like the half the","start":2162.87,"duration":4.86},{"text":"period of the other one right the","start":2165.99,"duration":4.14},{"text":"especially the the a the a flat on top","start":2167.73,"duration":4.68},{"text":"is gonna have a period which is half of","start":2170.13,"duration":5.19},{"text":"the period of the a on the bottom one","start":2172.41,"duration":7.59},{"text":"right so you have okay if you go half of","start":2175.32,"duration":9.24},{"text":"this one you get right okay okay so how","start":2180.0,"duration":7.29},{"text":"do we actually get these notes out from","start":2184.56,"duration":5.57},{"text":"that spectra from the from the waveform","start":2187.29,"duration":6.48},{"text":"who can tell me how can I extract these","start":2190.13,"duration":6.13},{"text":"pitches these frequencies from the other","start":2193.77,"duration":7.02},{"text":"signal any guess okay a free transform","start":2196.26,"duration":6.27},{"text":"that I think if are kind of a good guess","start":2200.79,"duration":4.74},{"text":"what does it happen if I perform now a","start":2202.53,"duration":5.85},{"text":"Fourier transform of that signal anyone","start":2205.53,"duration":5.13},{"text":"can actually answer me you cannot raise","start":2208.38,"duration":5.72},{"text":"your hand because I don't see just shout","start":2210.66,"duration":3.44},{"text":"so if you basically perform the Fourier","start":2215.12,"duration":4.57},{"text":"transform of the whole scene are you","start":2218.43,"duration":4.91},{"text":"gonna hear like the whole notes together","start":2219.69,"duration":6.78},{"text":"all together right but then you can't","start":2223.34,"duration":5.26},{"text":"figure out which pitch is playing where","start":2226.47,"duration":6.79},{"text":"or when actually in this case right","start":2228.6,"duration":7.06},{"text":"ha so we need kind of a Fourier","start":2233.26,"duration":4.95},{"text":"transform which is localized and so a","start":2235.66,"duration":5.1},{"text":"localized Fourier transform in time or","start":2238.21,"duration":4.98},{"text":"in space depending on whatever domain","start":2240.76,"duration":4.83},{"text":"you are using its called spectrograph","start":2243.19,"duration":4.2},{"text":"right and so on I'm gonna be now","start":2245.59,"duration":3.39},{"text":"printing for you the spectrogram oh","start":2247.39,"duration":2.61},{"text":"sorry","start":2248.98,"duration":2.91},{"text":"and I'll be printing here the","start":2250.0,"duration":4.38},{"text":"spectrogram of this one here and so here","start":2251.89,"duration":4.62},{"text":"you can compare the two alright on the","start":2254.38,"duration":5.58},{"text":"first part here on this side here you're","start":2256.51,"duration":6.18},{"text":"gonna have this peak here at 1600 which","start":2259.96,"duration":8.01},{"text":"is the the higher power there we go now","start":2262.69,"duration":6.87},{"text":"you have a second one which is this peak","start":2267.97,"duration":8.67},{"text":"here you can see this peak right and you","start":2269.56,"duration":12.45},{"text":"see this peak yeah okay so these Peaks","start":2276.64,"duration":7.62},{"text":"are gonna be the actual notes I play","start":2282.01,"duration":3.51},{"text":"with the right hand","start":2284.26,"duration":3.3},{"text":"so let's actually put those together and","start":2285.52,"duration":3.69},{"text":"I'm gonna have here the frequencies so I","start":2287.56,"duration":5.58},{"text":"have 1600 1200 and 800 can you see here","start":2289.21,"duration":7.2},{"text":"I have 1600 and 800 Y one is double of","start":2293.14,"duration":7.41},{"text":"the other because they are one octave","start":2296.41,"duration":8.58},{"text":"apart so if this is this gonna be okay","start":2300.55,"duration":6.99},{"text":"and this is a fifth which is like a also","start":2304.99,"duration":4.98},{"text":"has a nice interval so then we actually","start":2307.54,"duration":4.74},{"text":"generate these signals here and then I","start":2309.97,"duration":4.8},{"text":"gotta be concatenate the mouth so I'm","start":2312.28,"duration":4.44},{"text":"gonna be playing both these the first","start":2314.77,"duration":6.09},{"text":"one is actually the original audio but","start":2316.72,"duration":5.389},{"text":"[Music]","start":2320.86,"duration":4.61},{"text":"let me try again","start":2322.109,"duration":3.361},{"text":"the second one the concatenation yeah so","start":2325.68,"duration":9.18},{"text":"it's a bit loud I can now cannot even","start":2330.78,"duration":5.88},{"text":"reduce the volume oh I can reduce it","start":2334.86,"duration":6.86},{"text":"here too much okay let me go again all","start":2336.66,"duration":5.06},{"text":"right","start":2342.02,"duration":3.33},{"text":"so this is the concatenation of these","start":2343.26,"duration":6.03},{"text":"four different pitches so guess what we","start":2345.35,"duration":7.03},{"text":"are going to be doing next so how can I","start":2349.29,"duration":5.91},{"text":"extract all the notes that I can hear in","start":2352.38,"duration":8.04},{"text":"a specific given piece so let's say I","start":2355.2,"duration":7.68},{"text":"you play a full score and I'd like to","start":2360.42,"duration":8.94},{"text":"know which pitch is play at what time of","start":2362.88,"duration":10.77},{"text":"what so the answer was convolution

is","start":2484.16,"duration":10.23},{"text":"it sampling issues right transitions so","start":2489.529,"duration":7.56},{"text":"whenever you have deep you actually have","start":2494.39,"duration":4.709},{"text":"one white waveform one waveform and then","start":2497.089,"duration":4.59},{"text":"the other one one away from his to

spike","start":2513.589,"duration":4.14},{"text":"because it's gonna get basically you can","start":2514.909,"duration":4.56},{"text":"think about the jump is like having a","start":2517.729,"duration":4.02},{"text":"very high frequency right because it's a","start":2519.469,"duration":4.47},{"text":"it's like a delta right so you actually","start":2521.749,"duration":3.72},{"text":"get all the frequencies that's why you","start":2523.939,"duration":4.55},{"text":"get all the frequencies here boom okay","start":2525.469,"duration":7.08},{"text":"makes sense right so far kind of alright","start":2528.489,"duration":7.5},{"text":"so this is the green version that I","start":2532.549,"duration":6.171},{"text":"cannot even sign and what","start":2535.989,"duration":5.101},{"text":"left side here why is on the

hand","start":2545.8,"duration":5.64},{"text":"the cold are the one I show you on the","start":2548.74,"duration":5.369},{"text":"bottom left side okay so let me

you","start":2557.32,"duration":5.67},{"text":"first all the kernels you can tell now","start":2560.2,"duration":5.04},{"text":"the red one is going to be the first","start":2562.99,"duration":5.1},{"text":"chunk of my signal they want the real","start":2565.24,"duration":4.92},{"text":"one and then you can see the first pitch","start":2568.09,"duration":5.19},{"text":"is gonna be the has the same frequency","start":2570.16,"duration":3.66},{"text":"can you see","start":2573.28,"duration":5.18},{"text":"so the problem have the same same same","start":2573.82,"duration":6.87},{"text":"delta T the same interval the same","start":2578.46,"duration":5.77},{"text":"period can you see you cannot nod your","start":2580.69,"duration":5.19},{"text":"head because again I don't see you had","start":2584.23,"duration":4.47},{"text":"to answer me can you see or not okay","start":2585.88,"duration":5.13},{"text":"thank you fantastic and so this one is","start":2588.7,"duration":4.35},{"text":"that the third one you can see that it","start":2591.01,"duration":3.87},{"text":"starts here in the period-- and it","start":2593.05,"duration":4.08},{"text":"finishes here if you go up here you're","start":2594.88,"duration":3.87},{"text":"gonna see exactly there were two of","start":2597.13,"duration":3.39},{"text":"these guys right so that's why you can","start":2598.75,"duration":3.72},{"text":"see that's how you can see this is like","start":2600.52,"duration":4.099},{"text":"twice the frequency of the one below","start":2602.47,"duration":5.04},{"text":"finally I'm gonna be performing the","start":2604.619,"duration":5.47},{"text":"convolution of these four corners with","start":2607.51,"duration":6.21},{"text":"my input signal and this is how we look","start":2610.089,"duration":6.75},{"text":"like okay so the first kernel has a high","start":2613.72,"duration":5.85},{"text":"match in the first part of the of the","start":2616.839,"duration":5.311},{"text":"score so between zero and zero five","start":2619.57,"duration":5.13},{"text":"seconds the second one starts just after","start":2622.15,"duration":4.68},{"text":"after the first one then you have the","start":2624.7,"duration":4.35},{"text":"third one starting at zero three I guess","start":2626.83,"duration":3.99},{"text":"and then you have the last one","start":2629.05,"duration":4.71},{"text":"starting at the zero six okay and so","start":2630.82,"duration":6.12},{"text":"guess what I'm gonna make you listen to","start":2633.76,"duration":5.04},{"text":"convolutions now are you excited","start":2636.94,"duration":5.58},{"text":"oh okay you actually answering now good","start":2638.8,"duration":6.289},{"text":"alright and so these are the outcomes","start":2642.52,"duration":4.92},{"text":"let me lower a little the volumes","start":2645.089,"duration":7.241},{"text":"otherwise you complain yeah I can't","start":2647.44,"duration":7.46},{"text":"lower the","start":2652.33,"duration":2.57},{"text":"okay so the first one let's try again","start":2656.8,"duration":6.89},{"text":"how cool is that it's just listen to","start":2668.88,"duration":8.23},{"text":"convolution okay so basically this was","start":2671.95,"duration":7.32},{"text":"on I have one more slide because I","start":2677.11,"duration":4.17},{"text":"felt like there was some confusion last","start":2679.27,"duration":4.11},{"text":"time about what is the different","start":2681.28,"duration":4.08},{"text":"dimensionality of different type of","start":2683.38,"duration":4.83},{"text":"signals so I'm really recommending to go","start":2685.36,"duration":5.49},{"text":"and take the class of young Bruna which","start":2688.21,"duration":4.68},{"text":"is math for deep learning and I stole","start":2690.85,"duration":5.73},{"text":"one of his you know small things he was","start":2692.89,"duration":5.28},{"text":"teaching I just put a one slide here","start":2696.58,"duration":7.74},{"text":"together for you so this slide is the","start":2698.17,"duration":12.99},{"text":"following so okay so we have the input","start":2704.32,"duration":8.82},{"text":"layer or the samples we provide into","start":2711.16,"duration":5.25},{"text":"this network and so usually our last","start":2713.14,"duration":5.28},{"text":"time I define this I have this curly X","start":2716.41,"duration":4.47},{"text":"which is gonna be made of those x i's","start":2718.42,"duration":4.59},{"text":"which are all my data same post right","start":2720.88,"duration":4.44},{"text":"and so I usually have em there are","start":2723.01,"duration":6.09},{"text":"samples so my I goes from n 1 to n ok so","start":2725.32,"duration":6.48},{"text":"is this clear on is this notation clear","start":2729.1,"duration":4.98},{"text":"because it's a bit more formal I use AMA","start":2731.8,"duration":4.95},{"text":"less formal but then somehow someone was","start":2734.08,"duration":4.95},{"text":"feeling a little bit not comfortable I","start":2736.75,"duration":5.31},{"text":"think so this one is just my input","start":2739.03,"duration":7.44},{"text":"samples but we we can also see this one","start":2742.06,"duration":7.2},{"text":"is this curly X which is my input set as","start":2746.47,"duration":6.48},{"text":"the set of all these functions as x i's","start":2749.26,"duration":7.23},{"text":"which are mapping my Omega capital Omega","start":2752.95,"duration":6.9},{"text":"which is my domain to a RC which are","start":2756.49,"duration":5.07},{"text":"going to be basically my channels of","start":2759.85,"duration":6.3},{"text":"that specific example in so here I'm","start":2761.56,"duration":6.24},{"text":"gonna be mapping those lowercase Omega","start":2766.15,"duration":7.89},{"text":"to these x i's of omega so let's see how","start":2767.8,"duration":7.62},{"text":"these different this from the previous","start":2774.04,"duration":3.51},{"text":"notation so I'm gonna give you now three","start":2775.42,"duration":3.75},{"text":"examples and I you should be able to","start":2777.55,"duration":3.75},{"text":"tell now what is the dimensionality and","start":2779.17,"duration":5.13},{"text":"is all in this example so the first one","start":2781.3,"duration":3.52},{"text":"let's say","start":2784.3,"duration":2.29},{"text":"I have likely one and show you right now","start":2784.82,"duration":4.74},{"text":"in the time just fun piece of you know","start":2786.59,"duration":5.34},{"text":"audio signal so my Omega is going to be","start":2789.56,"duration":5.31},{"text":"just the samples like sample number one","start":2791.93,"duration":4.98},{"text":"sample number two like the index right","start":2794.87,"duration":4.68},{"text":"so you have index one index to index","start":2796.91,"duration":5.76},{"text":"until these 70,000 whatever we just

the","start":2804.74,"duration":4.59},{"text":"number of seconds divided by the delta T","start":2806.48,"duration":4.8},{"text":"which would be the you know 1 over

discrete","start":2817.25,"duration":5.97},{"text":"samples so this is my input data and","start":2818.96,"duration":7.08},{"text":"then what about the image of

no","start":2873.02,"duration":5.25},{"text":"better thank you","start":2876.52,"duration":4.48},{"text":"let's say thanks to John alright second","start":2878.27,"duration":4.8},{"text":"example I have here my Omega is going to","start":2881.0,"duration":5.01},{"text":"be the Cartesian product of these two","start":2883.07,"duration":4.56},{"text":"sets the first set is going to be going","start":2886.01,"duration":4.89},{"text":"from 1 to the height and also this one","start":2887.63,"duration":5.52},{"text":"in discrete and the other one is going","start":2890.9,"duration":3.81},{"text":"to be going from 1 to the width so these","start":2893.15,"duration":3.87},{"text":"are the actual pictures and so this

here no dots around and so\non second element is gonna be a two okay","start":354.979,"duration":7.801},{"text":"X and then until the last one which is\ngonna be D okay there's no dot but sure","start":362.78,"duration":10.19},{"text":"like someone is calling that dot product\ninstead of the cross product but that is","start":372.97,"duration":4.84},{"text":"assumes like you use a

okay so we have Z 1 Z 2 and so on\nuntil Z M and this is my final set right","start":386.71,"duration":8.41},{"text":"my vector is that okay fantastic so now\nwe are going to be focusing a little bit","start":395.12,"duration":4.59},{"text":"about the meaning of this thing over\nhere okay other questions so far","start":399.71,"duration":8.88},{"text":"all right this is very trivial so far I\nhope I mean let me know if if not okay","start":408.59,"duration":5.94},{"text":"okay so let's analyze one of these guys\nhere so I'd like to figure out what is","start":414.53,"duration":5.61},{"text":"the meaning of writing a T times X right\nso my a T is gonna be my generic a I so","start":420.14,"duration":10.83},{"text":"let's assume in this case when

for","start":444.68,"duration":5.1},{"text":"you to understand so this one is gonna\nbe my a are these gonna be my alpha and","start":449.78,"duration":7.94},{"text":"then here you have like it's gonna be my\nX and is this gonna be here my X I so","start":457.72,"duration":10.9},{"text":"what is this what is the output of this\nproduct here these are here","start":468.62,"duration":8.81},{"text":"see you can sorry 8\/8 transpose it let's\ncall it let's say that is a row vector","start":478.21,"duration":10.26},{"text":"can you see know what is gonna be the\noutput of this operation here no why","start":490.03,"duration":17.85},{"text":"this is this is like a generic one of\nthe many aids right there are M

normal","start":523.31,"duration":7.35},{"text":"scalar product hold on\nso you have egg hey here do you have","start":530.66,"duration":12.06},{"text":"here this part here is gonna be a 1 it\nis gonna be a two okay then you have","start":542.72,"duration":5.79},{"text":"here x1 and now you have x2 right so how\ndo you express this scalar product here","start":548.51,"duration":10.04},{"text":"okay so I'm just writing let me know if\nyou took clear so I'm gonna write here a","start":559.98,"duration":6.75},{"text":"1 times X 1 plus a 2 times X 2 right\nthis is the definition clear right so","start":568.89,"duration":8.89},{"text":"far yeah no okay yeah question yeah that\nis meant to be a transpose Y a role","start":577.78,"duration":7.05},{"text":"times column vector so let's assume a is\na column vector then I have role x","start":584.83,"duration":4.77},{"text":"colouring so let's keep writing this\nstuff here so what is a 1 how can i","start":589.6,"duration":12.63},{"text":"compute AI a 1 second ok ok\nso I'm gonna write here the a 1 is going","start":602.23,"duration":12.99},{"text":"to be the length of vector a times\ncosine alpha then what about X 1 someone","start":615.22,"duration":5.55},{"text":"else the same right now wait what what\nis X 1 same thing right different","start":620.77,"duration":9.24},{"text":"letters so someone say something you're\nfollowing you're completely confused","start":630.01,"duration":7.44},{"text":"you're not having any idea it's too easy\nI have no idea what's going on here it's","start":637.45,"duration":5.76},{"text":"good right so far ok what's gonna be the\nsecond term the this one is gonna be X","start":643.21,"duration":10.56},{"text":"here write x cos x I right and then you\nhad the second term which is going to be","start":653.77,"duration":6.66},{"text":"what magnitude of a shout I can hear ok\nsine of alpha and then","start":660.43,"duration":13.49},{"text":"okay thank you okay","start":677.66,"duration":3.63},{"text":"all right I'm gonna be just putting\ntogether those two guys so you're gonna","start":683.93,"duration":3.94},{"text":"get equal magnitude of a times magnitude\nof x times cosine alpha cosine Phi plus","start":687.87,"duration":12.5},{"text":"sana sine alpha and sine cosine a sine X\nI sorry","start":700.37,"duration":7.84},{"text":"what is be starting the parentheses all\nright so there's the cosine of the","start":708.21,"duration":6.0},{"text":"difference of the two angle right\neveryone knows trigonometry here right","start":714.21,"duration":3.03},{"text":"sorry high school stuff so this one is\ngonna be equal to a x times the cosine","start":717.24,"duration":7.92},{"text":"of cos x i minus alpha right oh the\nother way around right from monoxides","start":725.16,"duration":5.84},{"text":"so what does this mean you can think\nabout each element so far is clear I I","start":731.0,"duration":6.04},{"text":"didn't do any magic yeah shake your head\nlike these four yes these four no this","start":737.04,"duration":5.64},{"text":"for maybe no something's working okay so\nyou can think about whenever you","start":742.68,"duration":5.13},{"text":"multiply a matrix times a vector that\nbasically each output of this operation","start":747.81,"duration":5.79},{"text":"is gonna be measuring so okay hold on\nwhat is this cosine how much is cosine","start":753.6,"duration":5.97},{"text":"of zero one so it means if these two\nangles if the two vectors are aligned","start":759.57,"duration":6.21},{"text":"which means there is a zero angle\nbetween the two vectors you can have the","start":765.78,"duration":4.68},{"text":"maximum value of this element right\nwhenever when you have the minus the","start":770.46,"duration":6.63},{"text":"most negative value when they are\nopposite right so when they're in","start":777.09,"duration":6.15},{"text":"opposition of phase you're gonna get the\nmost negative magnitude but then if you","start":783.24,"duration":5.07},{"text":"apply just let's a redo you're gonna cut\nall those negative things you're just","start":788.31,"duration":3.42},{"text":"checking for the positive matches right\nso neural net basically just perhaps","start":791.73,"duration":4.47},{"text":"who's gonna be figuring out only the\npositive matches right and so again when","start":796.2,"duration":4.32},{"text":"you multiply a matrix times a column\nvector you","start":800.52,"duration":3.1},{"text":"be performing element-wise sorry scalar\nproduct between each column each row of","start":803.62,"duration":7.71},{"text":"the matrix which represents your kernel\nright so whenever you have like a linear","start":811.33,"duration":4.89},{"text":"layer your kernel is gonna be the whole\nrow of the matrix and now you see what","start":816.22,"duration":3.78},{"text":"is the projection of that input on that\ncolumn I am on the input on that flow","start":820.0,"duration":7.05},{"text":"right so each element of this product is\ngoing to tell you the alignment with","start":827.05,"duration":5.85},{"text":"which the input is what is the alignment\nof the input with respect to the","start":832.9,"duration":4.68},{"text":"specific row of the matrix okay\nyes no this should shape some more like","start":837.58,"duration":7.02},{"text":"intuition while we are using these\nlinear transformations they are like","start":844.6,"duration":3.69},{"text":"allowing you to see the projection of\nthe input onto different kind of","start":848.29,"duration":4.85},{"text":"orientations let's say this way okay you\ncan try to you know extrapolate this in","start":853.14,"duration":9.16},{"text":"high dimensions I guess the intuition at\nleast I can give it to you works","start":862.3,"duration":3.84},{"text":"definitely in two and three dimensions\nin higher dimensions I kind of think it","start":866.14,"duration":4.44},{"text":"works in a similar way next lesson we\nare going to watch we are actually we","start":870.58,"duration":3.629},{"text":"are going to see how what is the\ndistribution of the projections in a","start":874.209,"duration":4.681},{"text":"higher dimensional space is this sort\ngonna be so cool I think all right so","start":878.89,"duration":4.35},{"text":"this was the first part of I think of\nthe class oh well there is one more more","start":883.24,"duration":6.539},{"text":"part so actually here this said here we\ncan also write it in a different way so","start":889.779,"duration":5.161},{"text":"maybe this is maybe it's known maybe\nit's not known when I saw it first time","start":894.94,"duration":5.19},{"text":"I didn't know so you know it's it's cool\nthat sometimes you see these things once","start":900.13,"duration":4.92},{"text":"again maybe so let's go back here is the\nthings that there and so you can express","start":905.05,"duration":5.4},{"text":"this Z as being equal the vector a 1 in\nthis case a 1 is gonna be the first","start":910.45,"duration":8.37},{"text":"column of the a matrix ok and this one\nis going to be multiplied by the scalar","start":918.82,"duration":4.01},{"text":"x1 now you have the second column of the\nmatrix so I have a 2 this is multiplied","start":922.83,"duration":6.55},{"text":"by the second element of the X right\nuntil the last one which is gonna be","start":929.38,"duration":5.49},{"text":"again I can't hear if it's M or n m like\nthis or end you know sign language which","start":934.87,"duration":10.06},{"text":"one n right you know sign language no\nyou should learn it's good you know","start":944.93,"duration":7.95},{"text":"inclusivity a and write the last column\ntimes your X and of course because n X","start":952.88,"duration":6.75},{"text":"has a size of n there are n items right\nand so basically when you also when you","start":959.63,"duration":4.47},{"text":"do a you know transformation a linear\nyou know apply a linear operator you","start":964.1,"duration":3.84},{"text":"can't be basically waiting each column\nof the matrix with the coefficient that","start":967.94,"duration":4.95},{"text":"is in a you know you have first column\ntimes the first coefficient of the","start":972.89,"duration":3.75},{"text":"vector second column and by the second\nitem plus third column times the third","start":976.64,"duration":5.49},{"text":"item and so you can see the output of\nthis DN transformation is a weighted sum","start":982.13,"duration":4.29},{"text":"of the columns of the a matrix okay so\nthis is a different kind of intuition","start":986.42,"duration":5.76},{"text":"sometimes you see these as like whenever\nyou want to express your signal your","start":992.18,"duration":4.44},{"text":"data is a combination of different you\nknow the composition this is kind of a","start":996.62,"duration":8.67},{"text":"linear composition of your input alright\nso that was the first part it is the","start":1005.29,"duration":5.31},{"text":"recap about the linear algebra a second\npart is going to be something even more","start":1010.6,"duration":6.93},{"text":"cool I think questions so far\nno easy too easy you're getting bored","start":1017.53,"duration":9.26},{"text":"sorry okay all right then I'm gonna\nspeed up I guess","start":1026.79,"duration":3.88},{"text":"alright so let's see how we can extend\nthe one that the stuff we have seen","start":1030.67,"duration":4.5},{"text":"right now to convolutions right so maybe\nconvolution sometimes are a little bit","start":1035.17,"duration":3.87},{"text":"weird let's see how we can do an\nextension to convolutions","start":1039.04,"duration":9.86},{"text":"all right so let's say I start with the\nsame matrix so I'm gonna have here four","start":1051.72,"duration":6.67},{"text":"rows and then three columns okay so my\ndata has to be if I had if I had this","start":1058.39,"duration":15.27},{"text":"matrix if I multiply this to a column my\ncolumn vector should be of size three","start":1073.66,"duration":5.7},{"text":"thank you all right so let me draw here\nmy column vector of size right and this","start":1079.36,"duration":4.89},{"text":"is gonna give you a output of size four\nokay fantastic","start":1084.25,"duration":4.559},{"text":"but then is your data let's say you're\ngonna listen to some nice audio audio","start":1088.809,"duration":6.931},{"text":"file is your data just three simple long\nhow long is gonna be your data let's say","start":1095.74,"duration":5.52},{"text":"you listening to a piece of music that\nis like three minutes","start":1101.26,"duration":3.33},{"text":"how many sample does three minutes of\nall your health yeah I guess what is","start":1104.59,"duration":7.74},{"text":"gonna be my sampling rate let's say\ntwenty two okay twenty two thousand kilo","start":1112.33,"duration":7.74},{"text":"Hertz right 22 kilohertz so how many\nsamples three minutes of music have","start":1120.07,"duration":6.41},{"text":"second you sure is monophonic\nor stereophonic just kidding okay so","start":1127.799,"duration":10.211},{"text":"you're gonna multiply the number of\nsample the number of seconds right","start":1138.01,"duration":4.64},{"text":"number of seconds times the frame rate\nright the okay the frequency in this","start":1142.65,"duration":6.01},{"text":"case anyhow so this signal is gonna be\nvery very long right it's gonna be keep","start":1148.66,"duration":3.96},{"text":"going down so if I have a vector that is\nvery very long I have I have to use a","start":1152.62,"duration":4.32},{"text":"matrix which is gonna be very very fat\nwide right okay fantastic so this top","start":1156.94,"duration":6.6},{"text":"keeps going this direction\nalright so my question for you is gonna","start":1163.54,"duration":3.54},{"text":"be what should I put in this location\nhere","start":1167.08,"duration":4.46},{"text":"what should I put here so do we care\nabout things that are further away","start":1175.57,"duration":12.45},{"text":"no why not\nbecause our data has the property of","start":1188.74,"duration":5.26},{"text":"locality fantastic so what am I gonna go\nwhat am I gonna be putting here a big","start":1194.0,"duration":6.299},{"text":"zero right fantastic mom okay so we put\na zero here and then what is the other","start":1200.299,"duration":6.391},{"text":"property so let me start drawing this\nstuff again right so can I have my","start":1206.69,"duration":3.119},{"text":"kernel of size three and then here I\nhave my data which is gonna be very long","start":1209.809,"duration":7.081},{"text":"right so hold on I can see all right so\nhere there are zero then let's say what","start":1216.89,"duration":14.279},{"text":"is the other property my my my date my\nnatural data have stationarity which","start":1231.169,"duration":5.791},{"text":"means the pattern that you expect to\nfind this can be kind of repeating over","start":1236.96,"duration":8.099},{"text":"and over again right and so if I have\nhere my three values here perhaps I'd","start":1245.059,"duration":4.081},{"text":"like to reuse them over and over again\nright and so if these three values let","start":1249.14,"duration":4.649},{"text":"me change the color maybe so you can see\nin there is the same stuff so I have","start":1253.789,"duration":6.99},{"text":"three values here and then I'm gonna be\nusing these three same values one step","start":1260.779,"duration":6.451},{"text":"for the rain and I keep going further I\ndon't down and I keep going this way all","start":1267.23,"duration":9.54},{"text":"right so what should I put here on the\nbottom what should I put here a zero","start":1276.77,"duration":6.029},{"text":"right why that why is that because of\nlocality of the data right so putting","start":1282.799,"duration":5.73},{"text":"zeros around is called it's also called\npadding but in this case it's called","start":1288.529,"duration":7.821},{"text":"sparsity right so this is

we have now how many","start":1324.33,"duration":5.76},{"text":"parameters I have on the right hand side","start":1330.09,"duration":3.44},{"text":"well so we have three parameters over\nleft on the

whole you have three parameters\none side on the other side you have 12","start":1348.9,"duration":7.91},{"text":"okay that is good using locality and\nspiral and whatever not like sparsity","start":1356.81,"duration":5.05},{"text":"and parameter sharing but then now we\nend up with just three parameters isn't","start":1361.86,"duration":3.75},{"text":"this too restrictive how

the\nfirst kernel down here now he has some","start":1381.57,"duration":6.66},{"text":"second kernel let's say listen and I\nhave last one here right and so you

here","start":1476.129,"duration":4.17},{"text":"such that Oh everything that is down\nhere it gets cleaned up right and then","start":1480.299,"duration":4.771},{"text":"finally I'm gonna be using

actually","start":1538.48,"duration":4.75},{"text":"make it glow green because it's green\nkarna so you have a one times what it's","start":1543.23,"duration":11.97},{"text":"gonna be from the number

later.","start":2132.14,"duration":2.92},{"text":"Anyhow, so this was like in the first","start":2135.06,"duration":4.22},{"text":"part you're gonna have the first note\nthere's A\u266d that you have a B\u266d","start":2139.29,"duration":3.99},{"text":"A\u266d and B so you have \u2026 and the and the\ndifference between the first pitch and","start":2143.28,"duration":8.27},{"text":"is one octave there for the first\nfrequency is gonna be twice the second","start":2151.55,"duration":5.89},{"text":"frequency okay so whenever we're gonna\nbe observing the waveform one sign will","start":2157.44,"duration":5.43},{"text":"have to a shorter like the half the\nperiod of the other one right the","start":2162.87,"duration":4.86},{"text":"especially the the a the a flat on

of","start":2172.41,"duration":7.59},{"text":"this one you get right okay okay so how\ndo we actually get these notes out from","start":2180.0,"duration":7.29},{"text":"that spectra from the from the

basically perform the Fourier\ntransform of the whole scene are you","start":2215.12,"duration":4.57},{"text":"gonna hear like the whole notes together\nall together right but then you can't","start":2219.69,"duration":6.78},{"text":"figure out which pitch is playing where\nor when actually in this case right","start":2226.47,"duration":6.79},{"text":"ha so we need kind of a

domain","start":2238.21,"duration":4.98},{"text":"you are using its called spectrograph\nright and so on I'm gonna be now","start":2243.19,"duration":4.2},{"text":"printing for you the spectrogram oh\nsorry","start":2247.39,"duration":2.61},{"text":"and I'll be printing here the\nspectrogram of this one here and so here","start":2250.0,"duration":4.38},{"text":"you can compare the two alright

now","start":2259.96,"duration":8.01},{"text":"you have a second one which is this peak\nhere you can see this peak right and you","start":2267.97,"duration":8.67},{"text":"see this peak yeah okay so these Peaks\nare gonna be the actual notes I play","start":2276.64,"duration":7.62},{"text":"with the right hand\nso let's actually put those together and","start":2284.26,"duration":3.3},{"text":"I'm gonna have here the frequencies so I\nhave 1600 1200 and 800 can you see here","start":2287.56,"duration":5.58},{"text":"I have 1600 and 800 Y one is double of\nthe other because they are one octave","start":2293.14,"duration":7.41},{"text":"apart so if this is this gonna be okay\nand this is a fifth which is like a also","start":2300.55,"duration":6.99},{"text":"has a nice interval so then we actually\ngenerate these signals here and then I","start":2307.54,"duration":4.74},{"text":"gotta be concatenate the mouth so I'm\ngonna be playing both these the first","start":2312.28,"duration":4.44},{"text":"one is actually the original audio but","start":2316.72,"duration":5.389},{"text":"let me try again","start":2322.109,"duration":3.361},{"text":"the

all","start":2334.86,"duration":6.86},{"text":"right\nso this is the concatenation of these","start":2342.02,"duration":3.33},{"text":"four different pitches so guess what we\nare going to be doing

Alfredo kanjyani and Margo Stein who is Neymar here the other TAS and you'll talk to them much more than that you'll talk to me that's the first thing the other confession I have to make is that if you have questions about this class don't ask them at the end of this course because I have to run right after the class to catch an airplane but I can't wait until next week okay so let's start right in some very basic course information there is a website as you can see I will do what I can to post the PDF of the slides on the website probably just before the lecture probably just a few minutes before the lecture usually but but it should be there by the time you you get to class so at least by exam I get to class there's going to be nine lectures that I'm going to teach on Monday evenings there is also a practical session every Tuesday nights that further on mark will be running so they'll go through some of the you know practical questions some you know refreshers on sort of math you know mathematics are necessary for this and basic concepts some tutorials on how to use my torch and various other software tools and that's going to be three guest lectures the names of the guest lecturer are not finalized but but it's gonna be on topics like natural language processing computer vision cell supervisor learning things like that there's going to be a midterm exam or at least we think there is and it's going to take one of those sessions you know you run around March and the evaluation will be done on the midterm and on a final project and you can sort of you know been in groups of two us a two or three or just two we didn't decide yet we'll see the project will probably have to do with a combination of supervised running and autonomous driving we are discussing with various people for data and things like that okay let me talk a little bit about so the this this first lecture is really going to be sort of a broad introduction about what deep running is really and what you can do what you cannot do so it will serve as an introduction to the entire thing so we'll go through the entire arc if you want of the class but in a very superficial term so that you get sort of broad high-level idea of all the topics we're talking about and whenever I'll talk about its particular topic you'll see where it fits in this kind of whole picture but before that so there is a prerequisite for the class which is you know you need to be kind of familiar with machine learning or at least basic Constitution learning who here has played with fighters tensorflow has trained neural net ok who is not done that so be shy ok ok so the majority has which is good but I'm not going to assume that you know everything about this particularly am I going to assume that you know a lot of the you know sort of deep underlying techniques ok so here is the course plan and depending on what you tell me I can address this and sort of you know go faster on certain sections that you think are too obvious because you've played with this before or or other things so so intro to supervisor on in your honesty planning that's what I'm going to talk about today what what deep learning can do when you cannot do what are good features deep learning is about no new representations so now let's talk about next week will be about back propagation and basic architectural components so things like the fact that you build neural Nets out of modules and you connect with each other the you compute gradients you get automatic differentiations and then these various types of architectures loss functions activation functions you know different modules tricks like weight sharing and we're tying market multiplicative interactions attention gating things like this right are there particular macro architecture is like mixture of Oxford Siamese net hyper networks make sense right so we'll we'll dive pretty quickly in and that's appropriate if you've already played with some of those things then there'll be either one or two lectures I haven't completely decided yet yet about commercial Nets and their applications one of them might end up being a guest lecture then more specifically about deep learning architectures that are useful in in special cases things so things like recurrent neural nets with back propagation through time which is the way you try and write current neural nets and and sort of applications of recurrent neural nets to things like control and you know pretty think time series and stuff like that then things like combined recurrence and gating and multiplicative interactions like get you gated recurrent units and STM and then things like really use multiplicative interactions as kind of really a basis of their architecture like memory networks transformers adapters etc which are sort of very recent architectures that are becoming to be popular and things like an LP and other other areas and then a little bit about graph neural nets which I'm not going to talk about this a lot because there is another course that you can take by John Brunner where he spends a lot of time on graph neural Nets then they will talk about how we get those deep learning systems to work and so various tricks to get them to work sort of under understanding the type of optimization that takes place in neural nets so the type of you know we we use of course learning is always about almost always about optimization and deep learning is almost always about gradient based optimization and there are certain rules about optimization in convex in the convex case that are well understood but they're not well understood when the training is stochastic which is the case for most deep learning systems and they're not very well understood also in deep learning because the the cost function is not is not convex it has local minima and several points and things like this so it's important to understand the geometry of the objective function I say it's important to understand but the the big secret here is that nobody actually understands so it's important to understand that nobody understands okay but there are a few tricks that have come up through a combination of intuition and and a little bit of theoretical analysis and empirical search things like initialization tricks normalization tricks and regularization tricks like drop out grading grading clipping is more for optimization things like momentum average HDD pallet the various methods for paralyzing HDD many of which do not work and then something a little exotic called target pop and the Lagrangian formulation of back part then I'll switch to my favorite topic which is energy based models so this is sort of a general formulation of a lot of different sort of approaches to learning whether they are supervised unsupervised have supervised and whether they involve things like inference like you know searching for the value of variables that nobody tells you the value of but that your process your system is supposed to infer so that could be thought of as sort of a way of implementing reasoning with neural nets so you could think of reasoning in neural nets as a process by which you have some energy function that's being optimized with respect to some variables and the value you get as a result of this optimization is the value of those variables you were trying to find and so there is sort of the the common view that a neural net is just a function that computes its output as a function of its input so you just run through the neural net you get an output but that's a fairly restrictive form of inference in a sense that you can only produce one output for a given input but very often there are multiple possible answers to a given input and so how do you kind of represent problems of this type where there are multiple answers multiple possible answers to a given input and one answer to this is you make those answers the minima of some energy function and your inference algorithm is going to find values of those variables that minimize this objective function and there might be multiple minima so that means you are your model might produce multiple outputs for a given input okay so energy based models it's kind of a way of doing this a special case all those energy based models are probabilistic models like you know Bayesian methods graphical model bridging nets and things like this energy methods are a little more general so a little less specific so special cases of this include things like people used to call structure prediction and then there is a lot of applications of this in what's called supervised running and that would be the topic of the next couple lectures so sub supervised running is a very very active topic of research today and probably something that's going to become really dominant in the future it's already in the space of a year it's become dominant in natural language processing and used in the last few months just three months there's been a few papers that show that supervised running methods actually work really well in things like computer vision as well and so my guess my guess is that supervised running is going to take over the world in the next few years so I think it's useful to hear about it in this class so the things like I'm not going to go through a laundry list of this but there are things that you may have heard of like version of autoencoders denoising auto-encoders burt which is you know those transformer architectures that are trained for natural language processing that transfer self supervised running and there are special case of denoising auto-encoder so a lot of those things you may have heard of without realizing they were all kind of it can be all understood in the context of this sort of energy based approach and I think was also generated by virtual networks which I'm sure many of you have heard and then there is a supervised learning on beyond so you know how do we get machines to really kind of become really intelligent like they're not super intelligent they're not very intelligent right now they can solve very narrow problems very well sometimes with superhuman performance but no machine has any kind of common sense and the most intelligent machines that we have probably as less common sense than a housecat so how do we get to cat level intelligence first and then maybe human level intelligence and I don't pretend to have the answer but I have you know a few ideas that are interesting to discuss in the context of supervised running there I've had some applications any question so that's the plan of your course okay it might change dynamically that is that's the intent any question okay yeah yeah there are assignments right okay so follow-through viewed in here Alfredo because you speak very loudly there this the final project is actually going to be a competition between the teams so this could be like a leaderboard and everything and in preparation for this the assignments will be basically practice to get familiar with all the techniques that you would need for deep running in general but for the final project in particular right also for midterm obviously okay so also you probably know that and this is gonna pretty boring for some of you who've already played with those things but but it start from the basics deep learning is inspired by what people have observed by the brain but the inspiration is just an inspiration it's not the attempt is not to copy the brain because there's a lot of details about the brain that are irrelevant and that we don't know if they are relevant actually to human intelligence so the inspiration is at kind of a conceptual level and it's a little bit the same as you know airplanes be inspired by birds but the underlying principles of flight for birds and airplanes are essentially the same but the details are extremely different they both have wings the boat generate drift by propelling themselves to air but you know airplanes don't have feathers and don't flap their wings so it's a bit the same the same same idea and the the history of this goes back to a field that has kind of almost disappeared or at least changed name now called sovereign alex if you want a specialist about the history of cybernetics is sitting right there Joe level in here raise your hand so Joe is actually philosopher and he is interested in the he actually has a seminar on kind of the history of AI in the what department this is media culture and communication so Nazi s hmm and he knows everything about you know the history of cybernetics so it started in the in the 40s with two gentlemen McCulloch and Pitt's their picture is on the top right here and they came up with the idea that you know people at the time or in you know interested in logic but neuroscience was a very sort of nascent healed and they got the idea that if neurons are are basically threshold units that are on or off then by connecting neurons with each other you can build boolean circuits and you can basically do logical inference with neurons and so they say you know the brain is basically a logical inference machines machine because the the the neurons are binary and this idea so the idea was that a neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs and then compares the weighted sum to a threshold it turns on if it's what the threshold turns off if it's if it's if it's below which is sort of simplified view of how real neurons work a very very simplified you that model can is stuck with the field for decades like almost four decades actually fool for decades then there was you know quasi simultaneously Donald Hebb who had the idea that neurons in the brain maybe it's an old idea that the brain learns by modifying the strength of the connections between the between the neurons that are called the synapses and you had the idea of what's what's now called hebbian learning which is that if two neurons fire together then they're the connection that links them increases and if they don't fire together maybe it decreases that's not an idea for learning algorithm but it's sort of a first idea perhaps and then cybernetics was proposed by these guys Norbert Wiener who is here and this is the whole idea that by having systems that kind of have sensors and can and have actuator you can have like feedback loops and you can have you know self-regulating systems and what's the theory behind this you know we sort of take that for granted now but the idea that you know you have things like kind of for example mmm you know you drive your car right you you turn the wheel and there's a so called PID controller that actually turns the wheel in in proportion to how you turn the steering wheel and it's a feedback mechanism that basically measures the position of the steering wheel measure the position of the of the wheel of the car and then if there is a difference between do to kind of corrects the wheels of the car so that they match the orientation steering wheel that's a feedback mechanism that the stability of this and the rules about this are basically all come from initially from from this work that led to a gentleman by the name of Frank Rosenblatt to basically imagine learning algorithms that modified the weights of very simple neural nets and what you see here at the bottom the two pictures here this is Frank Rosenblatt and this is the perceptron this was a physical analog computer it was not a three-line Python program which is what it is now it was a gigantic machine with you know wires and optical sensors so you could show it pictures it was very low resolution and then it had it would you know we could it had neurons that could compute a weighted sum and the weights could be adapted and the weights were potentiometers potentiometers had motors on them so they could rotate for the learning algorithm so there was electromechanical and what he's holding here in this end is a module of eight weights with you can count them with those potentiometers motorized potentiometers on them okay so there was a little bit of history of where neural nets come from another interesting piece of history is that this whole idea of sort of trying to build intelligent machines by basically simulating networks of neurons was born in the 40s kind of took off a little bit in the late 50s and completely died in the 1960s in the late 1960s when people realized that with the kind of running algorithms and architectures that people were proposing at the time you can do much you know you could do some basic very simple pattern recognition but you can do much so between 1969 roughly and or 1968 and 1984 I would say basically nobody in the world was working on neural nets except a few kind of isolated researchers mostly in Japan because Japan is its own kind of relatively isolated ecosystem for funding research people don't listen to the same kind of fashions if you want and then they feel took off again in 1985 roughly with the emergence of back propagation so back propagation is an algorithm for training multi-layer neural nets as you as many of you know and people were looking for something like this in the 60s and basically didn't find it and the reason they didn't find it was because they had the wrong neurons they were using macular pits neurons that are binary and the way to get back propagation to work is to use an activation function that is continuous differentiable that is continuous and and people just didn't have the you know the idea of using continuous neurons and so they didn't think that you could train those systems with gradient descent because things were not differentiable now there's another reason for this which is that if you have a neural net with binary neurons you never need to do you never need to compute multiplications you never need to multiply two numbers you only need to add numbers right if your neuron is active you just add the weight to the weighted sum it is inactive you don't do anything if you have continuous neurons you need to multiply the activation of a neuron by a way to get to get a contribution to the weighted sum it turns out before the 1980s multiplying two numbers particularly floating-point numbers on any sort of non ridiculously expensive computer was extremely slow and so there was an incentive to not use continuous neurons for that reason so the reason why back frog didn't emerge earlier than the mid 80s is because that's when you know computers became fast enough to do 14 point multiplications pretty much people didn't think of it this way but that's you know kind of read which was effectively that's pretty much what happened so there was a wave of interest in neural nets between 1985 and 1995 lasted about 10 years in 1995 it died again people in machine learning basically abandon the idea of using neural nets for reasons that I'm not gonna go into right now and that lasted until the late 2000 or 2010 so when around 2009 2010 people realized that you could use multi-layer neural Nets training with back prop and get an improvement for speech recognition it didn't start with image net it started with speech recognition around 2010 and within 18 months of the first papers being published on this every major player in speech recognition had deployed commercial speech recognition systems that use neural nets so if you had an Android phone and you were using any other speech recognition features in an Android phone around 2012 that used neural net that was probably the first really really wide deployment of kind of modern forms of deep learning if you want then into at the end of 2012 2013 the same thing happened in computer vision where the computer vision community realize deep learning coordinates in particular work much better than whatever it is that they were using before and started to switch using commercial nets and basically abandon all previous techniques so that created a second revolution now in computer vision and then three years later around 2016 or so the same thing happened in natural language processing in language translation and things like this 2015-16 and now we're going to see it's not happened yet but we're going to see the same revolution occur in things like robotics and control and you know a whole bunch of application areas but let me get to this okay so you all know what supervised running is I'm sure and this is really what the vast majority and not the vast majority like 90 some percent applications of deep learning use supervised running as kind of the main the main thing so supervised running is the process by which you collect a bunch of pairs of inputs and outputs of examples of let's say images together with a category if you want to do image recognition or a bunch of audio clips with there transcription a bunch of text in one language with the transcription in other language etc and you feed one example to the machine it produces an output if the output is correct you don't do anything or you don't do much if the output is incorrect then you tweak the parameters of the machine think of it as a parametrized a function of some kind and you tweak the parameters of that function in such a way that the output gets closer to the when you want okay this is a non technical term with supervised learning is all about so show a picture of a car if the system doesn't say cars with the parameters the parameters in the neural net are going to be the weights on the you know that compute weighted sums in in those simulated neurons tweak the knobs so that the output gets closer to the when you won the trick in neural nets is how do you figure out in which direction about how much to tweak the knobs so that the output gets closer to the one you want that's what gradient competition and back propagation is about but before we get to this a little bit little bit of history again so there was a flurry of models basic models for classification you know starting with a perceptron there was another competing model called the ADA line which is on the top right here they based on the same kind of basic architecture it's computer weighted sum of inputs compared to a threshold if it's above the threshold turn on if it's below the threshold turn off what you see the the the other line here the the thing that Bernie Widow is tweet is tweaking is actually a physical analog computer again so it's like like like the perceptron it was much less you know much smaller in many ways and the reason and tell you about this is that the the perception actually was a two layer neural net a two layer neural net in which the second layer was trainable with adaptive weights but the first layer was fixed in fact most of the time with most experiments it was it was it was determined randomly you would like randomly connect input pixels of an image to neurons that would you know be threshold neurons with random weights essentially this is what they call the associative layer and that basically became the basis for the sort of conceptual design of a pattern recognition system for the next four decades I want to say four decades yeah pretty much so so that model is one by which you you take an input you run it through a feature extractor that it's supposed to extract the relevant characteristics of the input that will be useful for the task so you want to recognize a face can you detect an eye how do you detect an eye well there is probably a dark circle somewhere things like that right you want to recognize a car you know all they are kind of dark round things etc so the problem here and so what this feature extractor produces is a vector of features which are things that may be numbers or they may be on or off okay so it's just a list of numbers a vector and you're going to feed that vector to trainable classifier in the case of perceptron or simple neural net it's gonna be just the system that computes a weighted sum compares it to a threshold and the problem is that you have to engineer the feature extractor so the entire literature of pattern recognition senses equal pattern recognition at least and a lot of computer vision at least the part of computer vision that's interested in recognition was focused on this part the feature extractor how do you design a feature extractor for a particular problem you want to do I don't know how Google character recognition what are the relevant features for recognizing on Google and how can you extract them using all kinds of algorithmic tricks how do you process the images you know how do you normalize their size you know things like that are you skeletonize them and you segment them from the background so the entire literature was devoted to this very very little was devoted to that and what we're deepening brought to the table is this idea that instead of having this kind of two-stage process for pattern recognition where one stage is built by hand where the representation of the input is the result of you know some hand engineered program essentially the idea of deep learning is that you learn the entire task end-to-end ok so basically you build your pattern recognition system or whatever it is that you want to do with it as a cascade or a sequence of modules all of those modules have tunable parameters all of them have some sort of non-linearity in them ok and then you stack them you stack multiple layers of them which is why it's called deep pruning so the only reason for the deep world and deep learning is the fact that there are multiple layers is nothing more to that ok and then you train the entire thing end-to-end so the complication here of course is the fact that the parameters are on the first box how do you know how to turn them so that the output does you know goes closer to the output you want that's that's what back propagation does for you ok why do all those modules have to be nonlinear it's because if you have to to successive modules and they're both linear you can collapse them into a single linear right the product of two linear functions or the composition of two linear functions is a linear function take a vector x matrix and multiply it by the second matrix it's as if you're pre computed the product of those two matrices and then multiply the input vector by that composite matrix so there's no point having multiple layers if those layers are linear ok it's actually a point but it's a manual point so since they have to be nonlinear what is the simplest multi-layer architecture you can imagine that has parameters that you can tune things like weights in the neural nets and is nonlinear and your eyes quickly that it has to look something like this so take an input an input can be represented as a vector right an image is just a list of numbers think of it as a vector you know the fact that it's an image for now piece of audio whatever it is that your your sensors or your data set gives you is a vector multiply this vector by matrix the coefficients in this matrix are the tunable parameters and then take the resulting vector right when you multiply a matrix by a vector you get a vector pass each component of this vector through a a nonlinear function and if you want to have the simple as possible nonlinear function use something like what's shown at the top here which people in the in your let's call the value people in engineering call this half wave rectification people in math call this positive part whatever you want to call it okay so apply this nonlinear function to every component of the vector that result from multiplying the input vector by the matrix okay now you get a new vector which has lots of zeros in it because whenever the widget song was less than zero yet which is zero if you pass through the value and then repeat the process take that vector x weight matrix pass a result through point wise non-linearity take the result pass it multiplied by a matrix that's a result through nonlinearities that's a basic neural net essentially okay now why is that called a neural net at all it's because when you take a vector and you multiply a vector by a matrix to compute each component of the output you actually compute a weighted sum of the components of the input by a corresponding row in the matrix right so this little symbol here there's a bunch of components of the vector coming into this layer and you take a row of the matrix computer with a weighted sum of those values where the weights are the the values in the row that matrix and that gives you a weighted sum and you do this for every row that gives you the result right so the number of units after the multiplication by a matrix is going to be equal to the number of rows of your matrix and the number of columns of the matrix of course has to be equal to the size of the input okay so supervised running in strategy more formal terms and when I showed earlier is really by which you're going to compare the output that the system produces so right you should input you run through the neural net you get an output you're going to compare this output with a target output and you can have an objective function a loss module that computes a distance a discrepancy penalty whatever you want to call it divergence okay there's various names for it and then you're going to compute the average of of that so that the output of this cost function is a scalar right you computes the distance for example Euclidean distance between a target vector and the vector that there's no one that produces the d-plan you put system produces and then you can compute the average of this cost function which is just a scalar you got into average it over a training set right so a training set is composed of a bunch of pairs of inputs and outputs compute the average of this over the training set the function you want to minimize with respect to the parameters of the system the dribble knobs is that average okay so you want to find the value of the parameters that minimizes the average error between the output you want and yeah I put you get averaged over a training set of samples so I'm sure you know the vast majority of people here sort of have a case of intuitive understanding what gradient descent is so basically the way to minimize this is to compute the gradient right so it's like you are in the mountain you're lost in the mountain and it's a very smooth mountain but there is fog and it's night and you want to go to the village and the valley and so the best thing you can do is you you turn around and you see which way is down and you take a step down in the direction of steepest descent okay so this search for the direction that goes down that's called computing a gradient or technically a negative gradient okay then you take a step down that's taking a step down in the direction of negative gradient and if you keep doing this and your steps are small enough small enough so that when you take a step you don't jump to the other side of the mountain then eventually you going to converge to the valley if the value is convex which means that if there is no kind of lake no mountain lakes in the middle where you know there's kind of a minimum and you're going to get stuck in that minimum the value might be lower but you don't see it okay so that's why convexity is important as well as a concept but here is another concept which is the concept of stochastic gradient which I'm sure again a lot of you have heard I'll come back to that in more detail this the objective function you're computing is an average over many many samples and you can compute the objective function in its gradient over the entire training set by averaging the the value of the entire training set but it turns out it is more efficient to just take one sample or a small group of samples computing the error that this sample makes thank you beating the gradient of that error with respect to the parameters and taking a step a small step then a new sample comes in you're going to get another value for the error and another value for the gradient which may be in a different direction because it's a different sample and take a step in that direction and if you keep doing this you're gonna go down the the cost surface but in kind of a noisy way there's gonna be a lot of fluctuations so what is shown here is an example of this this is Socastee gradient applied to a very simple problem with two dimensions we only have two weights and it looks gonna say my periodic because the examples are always shown in the same order which is not what you're supposed to do is to catch the gradient but as you can see the path is really erratic why do people use this there's various reasons one reason is that empirically it converges much much faster particularly if you have a very large training set and the other reason is that you actually get better generalization in the end so if you measure the performance of the system on a separate set that you you know I assume you all know the concept of training set and test set and validation set but so if you test the performance it's this time on a different set you get generally better generalization if you use the Kassie gradient and if you actually use the real true gradient descent the problem is yes no it's worse so computing the entire gradient of the entire dataset it is computationally infeasible I mean you can do it it's not any more expensive than you know you'll be less noisy will be slower so let me tell you why I mean this is something we're gonna talk about again when we talk about optimization but let me tell you I give you a training set with a million training samples it's actually a hundred repetitions of the same training sample with 10,000 samples okay so my actual sample is ten thousands training samples and I represent it a hundred times and I an eclaim that you know I scramble it and I tell you here is my training set with a million training samples so if you do a full gradient you're gonna compute the same values a hundred times you're gonna spend a hundred times more work than necessary without knowing it okay so this only works because of repetition but it also also works in kind of more normal situations in machine learning where you have samples that are have a lot of redundancy in them like very many samples are very similar to each other etc so there is any kind of coherence if your system is capable of generalization then that means sarcastic gradients gonna be more efficient because it's good if you don't use the Cassegrain you're not gonna be able to take advantage of that we don't see so that's one case where noise is good for you okay don't pay attention to the formula don't let's don't get scared because we're going to come back to this in more details but why is back propagation called back propagation and again this is very informal it's basically a practical application of chain rule so you can think of a new head of the type that I showed you earlier as a bunch of modules that are stacked on top of each other and you can think of this as compositions of functions and you all know the basic rule of calculus you know how do you compute the derivative of a function composed with another function well the derivative of you know f composed with G is the derivative of F at the point of G of X multiplied by the derivative of G at the point X right so you get the product of the two derivatives so this is the same thing except that the function instead of being scalar functions are vector functions they get vectors on it as input and the previous vectors as output more generally actually they take multi-dimensional arrays as input and multi-dimensional arrays as output but doesn't matter and basically what is the generalization of this chain rule in the case of kind of functional modules that have multiple inputs multiple outputs that you can view as functions right and basically the it's the same world if you kind of blindly apply them it's the same rule as you applied for as you apply for regular derivatives except he achieves partial derivatives but you know what you what you see in the end is that if you want to compute the derivative of the difference between the output you want and yet what you get which is the value of your objective function with respect to any variable inside of the network then you have to kind of back you know propagate derivatives backwards and kind of multiply things on the way all right will be much more formal about this next week for now you just know why it's called that propagation and because it applies to multiple layers okay so the the pictures I showed earlier of this neural net is nice but what if the input is actually an image right so an image even sort of a relatively low resolution image is typically like you know a few hundred pixels on the side okay so let's say 256 by 256 to take a random example okay a car image 250 see that 56 so it's got 65,536 pixels times 3 because you have RG and B components to it for you know you have three value for each pixels and so that's you know roughly two hundred thousand values okay so your vector here is a vector with two hundred thousand components if you have a matrix is going to multiply this vector this matrix is gonna have to have two hundred thousand rows columns I'm sorry and depending on how many units you have here in the first layer there's gonna be a two hundred thousand by you know maybe a large number that's a huge matrix right even it's two hundred thousand by one hundred thousand so you have a compression in the first layer you know that's that's already a lot of very very large matrix billions so it's not really practical to think of this as a full matrix what you're gonna have to do if you want to deal with things like images is make some hypothesis about the structure of this matrix so that it's not a completely full matrix that you know connects everything to everything that would be impractical at least for a lot of practical applications so this is where inspiration from the brain comes back there was some work classic work in in neuroscience in the 1960s by the gentleman at the top here hooba and Wiesel they actually want a Nobel Prize for this in the in the 70s but their workforce from the late 50s early 60s and what they did was that they poked electrode in electrodes in the visual cortex of various animals you know cats monkeys nice you know whatever I think they're like cats a lot and they try to figure out what the neurons in the visual cortex were doing and what they discovered was that so first of all well this is a human brain but I mean this charge is from much later but all mammalian visual system is organized in similar way you have signals coming in to your eyes striking your retina you have a few layers of neurons in your retina in front of your photoreceptors that kind of process the signal if you want they cannot compress it because you can't have you know the human eye as something like a hundred million pixels so it's like a hundred million pixel camera megapixel camera but the problem is you cannot have a hundred million fibers coming out of your eye because otherwise your optical nerve would be this big and you wouldn't be able to move your eyes so those neurons in front of your retina do compression they don't do JPEG compression but they do compression so that the signal can be compressed to 1 million fibers right you have 1 million fibers coming out of each of your eyes and that makes your you know optical nerve about this big which means you know you can carry the signal and turn your eyes this is actually a mistake that evolution made for vertebrates invertebrates are not like that in vertebrates have actually so it's a big mistake because the wires collecting the information from your from your retina because the neurons that process the signal in front of your retina the wires have to kind of it'll be in front of your retina and so blocking part of the view if you want and then they have to punch a hole through your retina to get through your brain so there's a blind spot in your visual field because that's where your optical nerve punches through your retina so it's kind of ridiculous if you have a camera like this to have the wires coming out the front and then you know dig a hole in your sensor to get the wires back it's much better if the wires come out the back right and vertibird got that wrong in vertebra got it right so you know like squid and octopus actually have wires coming out the back that much look here but anyway so the signal goes from your your eyes to a little piece of brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus which is under your brain actually and like at the basis of it it does a little bit of contrast normalization what about this again you know she lectures and and then that goes to the back of your brain where the the primary visual cortex area called v1 is it's called v1 in humans and there's something called the ventral hierarchy v1 v2 v4 i.t which is a bunch of brain areas going from the back to the side and in the if our temporal cortex right here this is where object categories are represented so when you go around and you see your grandmother you have a bunch of neurons firing that represent your grandmother in this area and it doesn't matter what your grandmother is wearing you know what what position she is in if there is occlusion or whatever those neurons will fire if you see your grandmother so they sort of category level things and and those things have been discovered by experiments with patients that had to have their skull open for a few weeks and where you know people poked electrode and had them watch movies and realize this is known that turns on if Jennifer Aniston is on the movie and it only turns on for Jennifer Aniston so with the idea that somehow the visual context you know can do pattern recognition and seems to have this sort of hierarchical structure multi-layer structure there's also the idea that the visual process is essentially a feed-forward process so the process by which you recognize a video object is very fast it takes about 180 second there's barely enough time for the signal to go from your retina to the info temporal cortex it takes about it was it's a few millisecond delay is per neuron that you have to go through how do a millisecond you really have time to for just you know a few spikes to go through the entire system so there's no time for like you know recurrent connections and like you know etc doesn't mean that there are no record connections it's tons of them but somehow fast recognition is done without them so this is called the the feed-forward ventral pathway and this gentleman here Kuniko Kashima had the idea of taking inspiration from Rizal in the 70s and sort of build a neural net model on the computer that had this idea that first there were layers but also the idea that human visual discovered that individual neurons only react to a small part of the visual field so they poked electrode in neurons in v1 and they realized that this neuron in v1 only reacts to motifs that appear in a very small area in the visual field and either no one next to it will react to another area that's next to the first one right so the neurons seem to be organized in what's called original topic way which means that neighboring neurons react to neighboring regions in the visual field what they also realize is that the group of neurons that all react to the same area in the visual field and they seem to turn on four edges at a particular orientation so one neuron will turn on for if it's receptive field has an edge a vertical edge and then the one next to it if the edges are all slanted and then next to each of the edges rotate it etc and so they had this picture of v1 basically as oriented orientation selectivity so neurons that look at a local field and then react to orientations and those groups of neurons that react to multiple orientations are replicated over the entire visual field so this guy Fukushima I said well why don't I build a neuron that that does this I'm not going to you know necessarily insist that my system extracts oriented features but I'm gonna use some sort of unsupervised learning algorithm to to train it so it was not training his system end to end he was training it layer by layer in some sort of unsupervised fashion which I'm not going to go into the details of and then he used another concept from so you see the concept that those neurons were replicated across the visual field and then use another concept for our for from urban visual code called complex cells so complex selves are units that pull the activities of a bunch of simple cells which are those oriented oriented orientation selective units and they pull them in such a way that if an orientation if an oriented edge is moved a little bit it will activate different simple cells but the complex cell since it integrates the outputs from all those simple cells will will stay activated until the edge moves beyond its with such a field solely those complex I'll build a little bit of shift invariance in the representation you can shift an edge a little bit and it will not change the activation the activity of one of those complex cells so that's what we now called completion and pulling in the in the contest accomplished on nets and that basically is what led me in the mid 80s or late eighties to come up with commercial net so there are basically networks where the connections are local they are replicated across the visual field and you you intersperse sort of feature detection layers that detect those focal features with pulling operation we'll talk about this at length in in in three weeks so I'm going to go to into every detail but but it has recycle this idea from Google in visual and Fukushima that I can get my pointer that basically every neuron in one layer computes a weighted sum of a small area of the input and the weighted sum uses those weights but those weights are replicated across so every neuron in a layer use the same set of weights okay so this the idea of weighting or which hearing so we're using back prop we were able to Train neural nets like this to recognize and regen digits this is back from the late 80s early 90s and this is me when I was about your age maybe a little older I'm about thirty this video and this is my phone number when I was working at Bell Labs doesn't work anymore it's a new jersey number and I hit a key and this is neural net running on the 386 PC with a special accelerator card recognizing those characters running a anyone that very similar to the one I just show you the animation of and this thing could you know recognize characters of any style including very strange styles including even stranger styles and so this was kind of new at the time because this was back when character recognition or pattern recognition in general we're still in the model of we extract features and then we turn your classifier on top and this could basically train the entire like learn the entire task from end to end you know basically the first few layers of that neural net would would play the role of a feature extractor but it was trained from data the reason why we use character recognition is because this was this wasn't the only thing for which we had data the only test for which there was enough data was either character recognition of speech recognition speech recognition experiments were somewhat successful but not as much pretty quickly we realized we could use those conditional Nets not just to recognize individual characters but to reckon as groups of characters so multiple characters at a single time and it's because of this conditional nature of the network which I'll come back to in three lectures that basically allowed those systems to just you will be applied to a large image and then they will just turn on whatever they see in their field of view whatever they see a shape that they can't recognize so basically if you have a large image you you train a comes from that it has a small input window and you swipe it over the entire image and whenever it turns on its mean is detected the object that you trained it to detect so here the system you know is capable of doing simultaneous segmentation and recognition you know back in the before that people in pattern recognition would have an explicit program that would separate individual objects from their background and from each other and then send each individual object character for example to a recognizer but with this you could you can do both at the same time you know if you're very valid you don't have to build a new special program for it so in particular it could be applied to natural images for things like like face phase detection pedestrian detection things like this right same thing train a commercial net to distinguish between an image where you have a face and individual you don't have a face join this with several thousand examples and then take that window swipe it over an image whenever it turns on there is a face of course the face could be bigger than the window so you set sample the image you make it smaller and you swipe your network again and then make it smaller again swipe your network again so now you can detect faces regardless of size okay in particular you can use this to drive robots so this is things that were done before deep running became popular okay so this is an example where the the network here is a commercial net it's applied to the image coming from a camera from a you know running robot and it's trying to classify every window of a small window like 40 by 40 pixels or so even nice as to whether the central pixel in that window is on the ground or is an obstacle right so whatever it classifies as being on the ground is green whatever it classifies as being an obstacle is red or purple if it's on a foot of the obstacle and that you can sort of map this to a map which you see at the top and then do planning in this map to reach a particular goal and then use this to navigate and so these are two former PhD students right ahead cell on the right chaos M&A on the Left or annoying this poor robot pretty confident the robot is not gonna break their legs since they actually wrote the code and trained it Pierce M&A is a research scientist at Google brain in California working on robotics right ahead sell is head of robotics research director of robotics research I did find they do pretty well so a similar idea can be used for what's called semantic segmentation so semantic segmentation is the idea that you can again with this kind of sliding window approach you can train a commercial net to classify the central pixel using a window as a context but here it's not just trying to classify obstacle Foreman obstacles is trying to classify something like 30 categories this is sit down Washington place I think this is Washington Square Park and it you know it knows about roads and people and plants and trees and whatever but it finds you know desert in the middle of Washington Square Park which is not is there's no beach that I'm aware of so it's not perfect at the time it was state of the art though that was the best system there was to do this kind of semantic segmentation I was running around giving talks like trying to evangelize people about deep running back then this was around 2010 so before the kind of deep running revolution and and when one person professor from Israel was sitting in one of my my talks and he's a theoretician but it was really kind of transfixed by the potential applications of this and he was just about to take a sabbatical and work for a company called Mobileye which was a start-up in Israel at the time working on autonomous driving and so a couple of months after he heard my talk he started working at mobileiron he's totally mobile I people you know you should try this completion on that stuff this works really well and the engineers they'll say yeah no we don't believe in that stuff we were one method so he tree he implemented it and tried it himself beat the hell out of all the benchmarks they had and all of a sudden the whole company switch to using commercial nights and they were the first company to actually come up with a vision system for cars that you know can keep a car in a highway and can break if there is a pedestrian or cyclist crossing I'll come back to this in a minute they were basically using this technique semantic segmentation very similar to the one I showed for the robot before snow came on this was a guy by the name of shy-shy leftwards you have to be aware of the fact also that back in the 80s people were really interested in using in sort of implementing special types of hardware that could run on edge really fast and these are kind of a few examples of neural net chips that were actually implemented I had to do with some of them but they were implemented by people working the same group as I was as I was at Bell Labs in New Jersey so this was kind of a hot topic in the 1980s and then of course with the interesting you're on that dying in the in the mid-90s people weren't working on this anymore until a few years ago now the hottest topic in in chip design in the ship industry is neural net accelerators you go to any conference on computer architecture you know chip like is sec which is the big kind of solid-state circuit conference half the talks are about neural net accelerators and I worked on a few of those things okay so then something happened as I told you around 2010 13 15 in speech recognition image recognition natural language processing and it's and it's continuing we're in the middle of it now for other topics and what happened and I'm really sad to say it didn't happen in my lab but but with our friends we started with yoshua bengio and geoff hinton back in the early 2000 we knew you know that that deep ronnie was working really well and we knew that the whole community was making a mistake by dismissing neural nets and he browning and so we didn't use the term deep learning yet we invented it a few years later so around 2003 or so 2004 we started kind of a conspiracy if you want we got together and we said we're just going to try to kind of beat some records and some data sets invent some new algorithms again without always to train very large neural nets so that will and will collect very large data sets that we will show the world that those things really work because nobody really believed it and that really kind of succeeded beyond or or wildest dreams in particular in 2012 geoff hinton had one student at xq Jeske who spent a lot of time implementing completion nets on GPUs which were kind of new at the time they were not Italian you but they're starting to become really high-performance so it was very good at sort of hacking that and and then they were able to train much larger neural nets co-official nets anybody was able to do before and so they used it to to train on the image that data said the image that dataset is a bunch of natural photos and the system is supposed to recognize the main objects in the photo among 1000 different categories and the training set had 1.3 million samples which is kinda large so what they did was build this really large very deep completion net pretty much on the same model as what we had before implemented on GPUs and let it run for a couple weeks and with that they beat the performance of best competing systems by a large margin so this is the error rate on image net going back to 2010 so 2010 it was about 28 percent error top 5 so basically you get an error if the correct category is not in the top 5 among 1000 okay so it's kind of a mild measure of error 2011 it was twenty five point eight percent the the system that was able to do this was actually very very large it was sort of somewhat conditional net like but it wasn't trained I mean only the last layer was trained and then Jeff and his team got it down to sixteen point four percent and then that was a watershed moment for the computer vision community a lot of people said okay you know now we know that this thing works and the whole community went from basically refusing every paper that had neural nets in them in 2011 and 2012 to refusing every paper that does not have a condition detonate in 2016 so now it's the new religion right you can't get a paper you computer vision conference unless you use common eyes somehow and the error rate went down really quickly you know people found all kinds of really cute architectural tricks that sort of made those things work better and what you'd see in there is that there was an inflation of the number of layers so my conditional Nets from the 90s had seven layers or so and from the early 2000s and then a next net had I don't know 12 then vgg the year afterward after that at 19 google Annette had I don't know how many because it's hard if you go how you count and then the workhorse now of object recognition the standard backbone as people called them as 50 layers it's called ResNet 50 but some you know some networks have 100 layers or so so I'll try to over a few years ago put together this chart that shows where each of those blob is a particular network architecture and the x-axis is the number of billions of operations you need to do to compute the output okay those things are really big billions of connections the y-axis is the top one accuracy on imagenet so it's not the same measure of performance as the one I showed you before so the best systems are around 84 today and the size of the of the blob is the memory occupancy so the number of millions of floats that you need to store to store the weight the weight values now people are very smart about compressing those things like you know quantizing them and these entire teams at Google Facebook and various other places that only work on optimizing those networks and compressing the things so they can run fast because to give you just a rough idea the number of times Facebook for example runs accomplished on that on its servers per day is in the tens of billions okay so there's a huge incentive to optimizing the amount of computation necessary for this so when one reason why conditional nets are being so successful is that they exploit a property of natural data which is compositionality so compositionality is the property by which C is composed of objects objects are composed of parts parts are composed of sub parts sub parts are really combinations of motifs and motifs are combinations of contours or edges right or textures and those are just combinations of pixels okay so there's this so-called compositional how key that you know particularly commissions of objects that one layer in the hierarchy form objects at the next layer and so if you can omim ik this composition of hierarchy in the architecture of the network and you let it learn the appropriate combinations of features at one layer that you know form the the features of the next layer that's really what deep running is okay learning to represent the world and exploit the structure of the world and the well being the fact that there is organization in the world because the world is compositional a station by the name of steward daemon who is at Brown University said so he was kind of playing on the famous Einstein quote Einstein said the most incomprehensible thing about the world is that the world is is comprehensible like among all the complicated things that the world you know the world could be extremely complicated so complicated that we have no way of understanding it and it looks like a conspiracy that we are able to understand at least part of the world and so Stewart Gaiman demon version of this is that the world is compositional or there is a God because you need supernatural things to be able to understand it if the world is not compositional so this has led to incredible progress in things like computer vision as you know from you know being able to unreliably I don't if you know the tech people to being able to generate masks for every object accurate masks and then even so figure out the pose and then do this in real time on a mobile platform you know I mean the progress has been sort of nothing short of incredible and most of those things are based on two basic families of architectures this sort of so-called one-pass object detection recognition architectures called retina net feature pyramid network there's various names for it so you net and then another type of masks are CNN both of them actually originated from Facebook or the people who origin it to them are now at Facebook they sometimes came up with it before they came to Facebook but you know those things work really well you know they can do things like like that detect object that are partially occluded and you know draw a mask of every object so basically this is our neuron that complex on that what the input is an image but the output is also an image in fact the output is a whole bunch of images one per category and for each category I put the mask of the object from that category those things can also do what's called instant segmentation so if you have a whole bunch of shapes it can tell you you know not just that this region is cheap but they actually pick out the individual shapes and will tell them apart and it will count the sheets right and fall asleep that's what you're supposed to do right you fall asleep you count chips right and the cool thing about deep learning is that a lot of the community has embraced the whole concept that research has to be done in the open so a lot of the stuff that we're gonna be talking about as you probably know in the class is it's not just published but it's you know published with code it's not just code it's actually pre trained models that you can just download and run all open source or free to use so that's really new I mean people didn't use to do research this way particularly in industry but even in academia people weren't used to kind of distributing the code but deep running has sort of somehow the race that's kind of driven people to kind of be more open about research so there's a lot of applications of all this as I said you know submarine car this is actually a video from mobile I and mobile I was pretty early in this using accomplish on that's for autonomous driving to the point that in 2015 they had managed to shoehorn accomplish on net on the chip that they had designed for some other purpose and they sold the license the technology to Teslas or the first self-driving Tesla's I mean start driving or release a drug without driving assistance right they can keep in line on the highway and change lane had this mobilized system and and that's that's pretty cool so that's a condition that it's a little chip that is you know just behind the it looks out the window and it's behind the the rear view mirror since then this you know four five years ago since then this kind of technology has been very widely deployed by a lot of different companies mobilized till now it was bought by Intel and they have like 70 or 80 percent of the market for those vision systems but but there is a lot of companies that and car manufacturers that use those things so in fact in some European countries every single card comes at even low-end cars has accomplished on that based vision systems and they call this emergent emergency sort of advanced emergency braking system or automated emergency braking system a EBS is deployed in every car in France for example if uses collisions about forty percent so not every car on the roads have them yet because you know people keep their cars for a long time but but what that means is that it saves lives so a very positive application of deep running another big category of applications of course is medical imaging so this is a it's probably the hardest topic in with in radiology these days is how to use AI which means commercial Nets for for radiology this is lifted from a paper by some of our colleagues here at NYU where they analyzed MRI images so there's one big advantage to commercial Nets is that they don't need to look at the screen to look at an MRI in particular to be able to look at an MRI they don't have to slice it into 2d images they can look at the entire 3d value this is one property that this thing uses it's a company it's a 3d commercial net that looks at the entire volume of an MRI image and then produces you know it uses the very similar technique for as I was showing before for symmetric segmentation and it produces it basically turns on on the output image wherever there is some you know here a femur bone but you know it could be uh so this is the kind of result it produces it works better in 3d than in 2d slices or you can turn on with it detects malignant tumor in mammograms this is to DES not 3e and this you know various other projects in medical imaging that are going around okay lots of applications in science and physics bioinformatics you know whatever which we'll come back to so okay so this is virtual mysteries in deep learning they're not complete mystery is because people have someone who's standing over list but they are mysteries in the sense that we don't have like nice theory for everything why do they work so well so one big question the theoreticians were asking many years ago when I was trying to convince the world that deep longing was a good idea was that they would tell me why you can approximate any function with just two layers what do you need more and I'll come back to this in a minute what's so special about co-official nets I talked about the compositionality of natural images or natural data in general is true for speech also and values of the signals natural signals but it seems a little contrived how is it that we can train the system despite the fact that the objective function we're minimizing is very non convex we may have lots of local minima this was a big criticism that people were throwing at neural nets people who'd never played with neural nets were throwing out neural nets back in the old days say like you know you have no guarantee that your algorithm will converge you know it's too scary I'm not gonna use it and and the last one is why is it that the way we train neural nets breaks everything that every textbook in statistics tell you every textbook in statistics tells you if you have n data points you shouldn't have more than n parameters because you're going to overfit like you know you might regular eyes your vision you might toilet prior but which is equivalent but the what guarantee do you have and with neural nets normal nets are widely over privatized we train neural nets with hundreds of millions of parameters routinely they're using production and the number of training samples is nowhere near that how does that work but it works ok so things we can do with DP Ani today you know we can have safer cars we can have better medical analysis medical image analysis systems we can have pretty good language translation far from perfect but useful stupid chat BOTS you know very good information search retrieval and filtering Google and Facebook now nowadays are completely built around deep learning you take deep running out of them and they crumble and you know lots of applications in energy management and production and all kinds of stuff manufacturing environmental protection but we don't have really intelligent machines we don't have machines with common sense we don't have intelligent personal assistants we don't have you know smart chat BOTS we don't have hassle robots you know I mean there's a lot of things we don't know how to do right which is why we still do research ok so deep running is really about running representations but really we should know in advance what we what representations are so I talked about the traditional part of the model of pattern recognition but um representation is really about you know you have your raw data you return it into a form that is useful somehow ideally you'd like to turn it into a form that useful regardless of what you want to do with it sort of a useful in a general way ok and it's not entirely clear what that means but at least you want to turn it into a representation that's useful for the task that you are envisioning and there's been a lot of ideas over the decades on sort of general ways to pre-process natural data in such a way that you produce good representations of it and I'm going to go through the details of this laundry list but the things like tallying the space doing random projection so random projection is actually kind of you know like a monster that rears its head periodically like every five years and you have to whack it on the head every time he pops up that was the idea behind the perceptron so the first failure a perceptron is a layer of random projections what does that mean you a run in projection is a random matrix which you know has a smaller output dimension and input dimension with some sort of non-linearity at the end right so think about a single layer neural net with nonlinearities but the weights are random so you can think of this as random projections and a lot of people are rediscovering that wheel periodically claiming that it's great because you don't have to do multi-layer training and so I started with the perceptron and then you know he came back in the 60s and then he came back again in the 1980s and then he came back again and now he came back there's a whole community most regions in Asia because they call to layer neural nets where the first layer is random they call this extreme learning machines okay and it's like it's ridiculous but it exists they're not extreme I mean they're extremely stupid but you know right so I was mentioning the compositionality of the world is you know from pixels to edges to text on motifs parts objects in text you have characters word where groups clauses sentences stories in speech it's the same you have individual samples you have you know spectral bands sound phone phonemes words etc you always have this kind of heart okay so here are many attempts at dismissing the whole idea of deep learning okay first first thing and this is things that I've heard for decades okay from mostly theoreticians but a lot of people and you have to know about them because they're going to come back in five years when people say our deep longing sucks why not use super virtual machines okay so here is super vector machines here on the top left support vector machine is a and I'm sure many of you have heard by kernel machines and super virtual machines who knows what this is I mean even if it's a rough idea what this is okay a few hands who has no idea what it's super fighter machine yet don't be shy yeah yeah I mean it's okay if you know okay like most people haven't raised their hands for either okay come on all the way up cool all right who has no idea what it is don't be shy it's okay all right good right so here's the super veto machine support vector machine is a two layer neural net it's not really a neuron that people don't like when it's formulated this way but really you can think of it this way it's a two layer neural net where the first layer which is symbolized by this function K here each unit in the first value compares the input vector X to one of the training samples X eyes okay so you take your training samples you sell you a thousand of them so you have a thousand excise from I equal one to a thousand and you have some function kayla is going to compare X and X I a good example of a function to compare the two is you take the dot product between X and X I and you pass a result through like exponential minus square or something so you get a Gaussian response as a function of the distance between X and X I okay so it's a way of comparing to two vectors doesn't matter what it is and then you take those scores coming out of this K function that compares the input to every sample and you compute a weighted sum of them and what you're gonna learn other weights the alphas okay so it's a two layer neural net in which the second layer is trainable and the first value is fixed in a way you can think of the first layer as being trained in an unsupervised manner because it uses the data from the training set but it only uses the X's doesn't use the Y's it uses the data in the stupidest way you can imagine which is you store every X and use every single X as the weight of a neuron if you want okay that's why the super activation is you can write a thousand page books about the cute mathematics behind that but the bottom line is it's a two layer neural net where the first layer is training a very super stupid way unsupervised and the second layer is just a linear classifier so it's basically glorified tablet matching because it basically compares the input vector to all the all the training samples and so it doesn't work if you want to do like you know computer vision with raw images if X is an image and the X eyes are a million images from imagenet first of all for every image you're gonna have to compare it with a million images or maybe a little less if you're smart and how you train it that's going to be very expensive and the kind of comparison you're making is basically what solves the problem the weighted sum you're gonna get at the end is really cherry on the cake I use the analogy too often actually so you can approximate you can you can have thorns that show that you can approximate any function you want as close as you want by tuning the K function and the alphas and so he was talk to authorities and they'll tell you why do you need deep learning I can approximate any function I want with a kernel machine the number of terms in that Sun can be very large and nobody tells you what kernel function you can use and so that doesn't solve the problem you can use a two layer neural net okay so this is the top right here the first layer is a nonlinear function f applied to the product of a matrix of u0 by input vector and then the second layer multiplied by the second matrix and then passes it to another non-linearity okay so this composite composition of two linear and non-linear operations again you can show that under some conditions you can approximate any function you want with something like this given that you have a large enough vector in the middle okay so the dimension of what comes out of the first layer if it's high enough potentially infinite you can approximate any function you want as close as you want by making this layer go to infinity so again you talk to theoreticians and they tell you why do you need layers I can approximate anything I want with two layers but there is an argument which is it could be very very expensive to do it in two layers and for some of you this may sound familiar for most of you probably not but let's say I want to design a logic circuit okay so when you design logic circuits right you have n gates and or gates and or NAND gates right you can do everything with just Nan's right negative ends and if you you can show that any boolean function can be written as a bunch of ORS on a bunch of a bunch you know bunch of ands and then an orang type of this that's called disjointed normal form DNF so any function can be written in two layers the problem is that for most functions the number of terms you need in the middle is exponential in the size of the input so for example if I give you n bits and ask you construct a circuit that tells me if the number of bits that are on in the input string is even or odd okay it's a simple boolean function one or zero on the output the number of gates that you need is essentially exponential in the middle if you do it in two layers if you allow yourself to do it in log n layers where n is number of input bits then it's linear okay so you go from exponential complexity to linear complexity if you allow yourself to use multiple layers it's as if you know when you write a program I'll tell you write the program in such a way that there is only two sequential steps that are necessary to run your program so basically your program has two sequential instructions you can have you can run as many instructions as you want in your program but they have to run in parallel most of them and you're only allowed two sequential steps okay and the kind of instructions you have access to are things like you know in your combination is nonlinear it is like simple things right not like entire sub programs so for most most problems the number of intermediate values you're going to have to compute in the first step it's going to be exponential in the size of the input there's only a tiny number of problems for which you're going to be able to get away with non exponential number of interns but if you allow your program to run multiple steps sequentially then all of a sudden you know we can be much simpler it will run slower but it will take a lot less memory it will take a lot less stuff resources so people we design computers our kids know this right you can design for example a circuit that adds two binary numbers and there is a very simple way to do this which is that you first you take the first two bits you add them and then you propagate the carry at the second bit the second pair of bits you know taking the carry into account that gives you the second bit of result and then carry you know propagate the carry and then you do this sequentially right so problem with this is that it takes the time that's proportional to the size of the other numbers that you're trying to add so circuit designers have a way of basically pre computing the carry this code carry look-ahead so that the number of steps necessary to do an addition is actually not n it's much less than that okay but that that's at the expense of a huge increase in the complexity of the circuit the the number of like the area that it takes on the chip so this exchange between time and space or between depth and and and and kind of time is is known so what do we call deep models so you know a two layer neuron that when de has one in a layer I don't call that deep even though technically uses backdrop but hey you know it doesn't really learn complex representations so this is idea of hierarchy in deep running as yen definitely under D unless you learn complicated kernels but then then others GM's anymore so what are good features what are good representations so here's an example I like there is something called the manifold hypothesis and it's the fact that natural data so if I take a picture of this room with you know a camera with a thousand by thousand pixel resolution that's 1 million pixels at 3 million values it leaves you can think of it as a vector with three million components among all the possible vectors with three million components how many of them correspond to what we would call natural images we can tell when we see a picture whether it's a natural image or not we have a model in our visual system that tells us this looks like a real like you really image and we can tell what it's not so the number of combinations of pixels that actually are things that we will that we think of as natural images is a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny subset of the set of all possible images is way more ways of combining random pixels in nonsensical images and there are ways of combining pixels into things that look like natural images so the manifold part is this is that the set of things that you know look natural to us live in a low dimensional surface inside the high dimensional ambient space and it will example to convince yourself of this imagine I take lots of pictures of a person making faces right so the person is in front of white background her hair not moving and she kind of move her head around and you know big faces etc the set of all images of that person so I take a long video of that person the set of all images of that person lives in a low dimensional surface so a question I have for you is what's the dimension of that surface whatever magnitude okay any yes yeah you've probably heard much feel before but huh okay so for whoever hasn't heard this you have a shot another shot at an answer okay any guess no I'll be shy and whatever like multiple proposals anyone you get on down your laptop but you know can point at you or something okay any idea yes no idea it's okay you ready on you have you heard what he said linear what does that mean it's a 1d space okay a one-dimensional subspace okay any other proposal yeah okay the images I'm taking our million pixels okay so the ambient space is 3 million dimensions they don't change no and the person can move the head you know turn around things like this but not really move the whole body I mean you only see the face it's mostly centered at thousand okay why okay yeah that's a good guess keys to motivation it's again the surface area of the person right so it's bounded by the number of pixels occupy other person that's for sure that's so that's an upper bound yes those pixels of course I'm not gonna take all possible values so that's a white upper ground any other idea okay so basically the dimension of that as as you said is bounded by the number of muscles in the face of the person right the number of degrees of freedom that you observe in that person is the number of muscles in the interface the number of independent removable muscles right so this 3 degrees of freedom due to the fact that you can tilt your head this way that way or that way that's three right there then there is translation this way that way will be this way and that way maybe you up or down that's six and then the number of muscles in your face right so you can smile you can you know pout you can do all kinds of stuff right and you can do this you know in apparently why'd you close one eye you can smile when when one direction you know I mean so whatever independent muscles you have no counting the tongue because there's tons of muscles in the tongue and that's about fifty maybe a little more so regardless it's less than 100 okay so the surface locally if you want to parameterize the surface occupied by all those pictures move from one picture to another it's a surface with less than 100 parameters that determine the position of a point on that surface of course it's a highly nonlinear surface it's not like this beautiful calabi-yau manifolds ear but but it's a it is a surface nonetheless of course the answer was in the side so you know so what you'd like is an ideal feature extractor to be able to disentangle the explanatory factors of variation of what you're observing right so the different aspects of my face you know it's not just I move my muscles and I move my head around each of those is an independent factor of variation again also we move my glasses you know the lighting could change that's another set of you know variable variables and what you'd like is a representation that basically individually represents each of those factors of variations so if there is a criterion to satisfy in learning good representations it's that it's finding independent explanatory factors of variation of the data that you're looking at and the bottom line is that nobody has any idea how to do this okay but that would be the ultimate goal of representation only and we basically are at the end okay I'll take two more questions if there is any yes okay so the question is is there some sort of pre-processing like PC air that will find those vectors yeah so PCI will find those if the manifold is linear so if you assume that the surface occupied by all those examples or faces is a plane then PCA will find the dimension of that plane principal component analysis right but no it's not linear unfortunately right let me yeah let me give you an example if you take me and my older son that looks like me and you place us to making the same face in the same position the distance between our images will be relatively small even though we're not the same person now if you take my face and my face shifted by 20 pixels there's more distance between me and myself shifted than there is between me and my son okay so what that means is that you know the manifold of my face you know is some complicated manifold in that space my son is a very different manifold which does not intersect mine yet these two those two many folks are very close to each other and they're closer to each other than any two samples from my man you follow into example from his manifold so PC is not going to tell you anything basically okay here is another reason why that that surface is not is not a plane you're looking at me right now I imagine the manifold which is a linear manifold one dimensional manifold of me turning my head all the way 360 okay that manifold is topologically identical to a circle it's not flat can't be it can't be aligned so PCA is not going to find it okay I gotta blast off thanks to you next week","5_qrxVq1kvc":"thank you for being here home time how we heard just 15 minutes today so we are going to be trying to squeeze as much as I can without running too much so there's gonna be like a small agreement between me and you every time we start class so the agreement is the following I'm here for trying to communicate to you right so I'm here because I'd like to send a message across every time you don't have idea what's going on you think I'm confusing you cannot understand my English you know I have a very strong Italian accent you know my mommy yeah no okay yeah I make jokes so don't take every word I say as truthful if I'm talking about you know you know being aggressive or whatever I'm joking most likely if I'm talking about you know deep networks and stuff usually it's reliable yeah okay so the point is gonna be like every time you have no idea what's going on just stop me call me I've I have know whatever idea was going on here stop repeat explain to me again I will explain to you as many times it's required if you do not understand something it's almost 99.9% my fault because I haven't taken an account your background and you know I'm skipping some steps perhaps because I'm not used to you know maybe this class or your background on what way whatsoever so again I'm here in order to educate in order to communicate and I can't do that if you don't help me right so if I ask a question you understand what I'm saying you should like nod your head because if you're like yeah not reacting to my jokes or questions then I have some issues understanding whether you are making any sense of what I'm saying if you get distracted I will try to use the eyes throat chokes don't come we don't have a choice here right I think I can try with markers but maybe not right just for an undergraduate today you're grownups so you should be able to you know keep yourself awake for the next 45 minutes more or less do not turn off because if you turn off I can't come there and take you and shake you right again you're not undergraduate anymore you're grownups some of you are under godless I guess so okay I figure out where you are if I may come and shake you up but for the others you should be able to stay awake for the next 15 minutes I know it's like late night so try not to eat before class so you don't have like you know after dinner thingy whatever so yeah so don't take me too seriously I'm Italian right so so so inspirational like why are we here to take a maybe so it's a competitive class right at the end we're gonna have a competition don't get too scared we do not only like consider how you're doing well in the final ranking we also consider how much how well is your work right so sometimes things don't quite work but you still apply yourselves so that's actually what matters nevertheless if you actually win the challenge you may have some gifts and presents and something from us yep that should be it also if you take a very nice grade you may come and you know join the lab perhaps with young and so on next semester so just saying you know take a nice grade so you can serve later Israel okay all right kind of joking so neural networks right did we see last time yesterday what neural networks are kind of know so I think we mentioned a few applications one of those were classifications so let me just give you a small recap about what classification is so what is classification let's say I take a picture of these of something right let's say I take a picture if one one megapixel camera so how many dimension will be my image so if I take an image I can consider my image which is gonna have RGB plane and it's gonna be heavy like a thousand pixel in the vertical and one thousand pixels or it's on telly so you're gonna have overall 1 million pixels so one megapixel you have RGB so how many pixels how many values will you have 3 million right ok cool so you can think about this image which can be thought as this kind of stack of three layers is one point living in this 3 million dimensional space and this 3 million dimensional space is really really really really large right you can move around and nothing happens right so let's say I take a picture of a dog and I have here a picture of a dog let's say I take a picture of a cat well it's gonna be a picture of a cat here here or here sorry ok hands up for whose things is cool things if this is my cat or dog who thinks the cut the other one is here ok maybe you were actually paying attention yesterday who were thinking who thinks the other point is gonna be here okay who thinks the other point is gonna be here fantastic ok so you actually on the right thing so everything is just in the same damn little spot in the space ok and everything everything it actually makes sense is here everything else is just trash and so we have to take the space go here take this point and move it here how do you move point have you taken linear algebra yes no ok about linear algebra so as you may know or if you don't know you do I do have Twitter and I'm very annoying person on Twitter because I talk a lot so let's see Twitter ok open Twitter all right so here I cannot zoom so twitter.com right so then you go oh there is no internet see ha let's connect Wi-Fi yes I'm connecting all right almost there okay so you want to do a search and you do a linear bra you cannot see anything here okay damn I gotta meet zoom here okay so you don't top right there is the search you do linear bra they do parenthesis from me I'll see and said okay so here's how you find out what are the questions for the meter right just check on Twitter I usually yeah leak stuff there all right so here you have these actually is very nice in this book introduction to linear algebra by Gilbert Strang so you may want to you know look up this stuff but the other one is this one here so you'd like to check the third tweet here where I show you the essence of linear algebra by I grant maybe you know this guy Brian Sanders if you don't know well you should know now just check this link right and this link is going to show you how you move stuff around okay anyhow it was the first link for today so how do you move things around in a space for the one actually didn't know how the energy linear algebra works you just talk it down raise their hands huh okay matrix multiplication buddha's edo rotation and here okay first matrix multiplication is a what kind of variation leaden transformation okay what are the linear transformation one rotation to you sure straighten okay fantastic then third stretching scaling I guess let's see scaling stretching this number two then if the determinant is negative what do you have what is it a reflection third and then one more is it okay I guess we have three for the moment this should be one more hold on so scaling right so you have scaling this way he has scaling in that way then you have rotation then you have reflection if there when you have reflection nano identity does nothing right so okay rotation means the matrix is orthonormal right cool second one you have scaling when do you have scaling okay well I wish you in fantastic so we have at the four right so we have rotation we have zoom in this way you have shearing right and then you have the reflection whenever you have the negative determinant cool still I want you to move things around is motion translation is a linear operation no yes you can also you don't have to rise hands adding scalars is adding scaler a linear operation hmm not sure because 0 where is the 0 mapped to right only if the 0 is mapped to 0 then you have a linear transformation anyhow so you have translation which is the fourth one at a fifth operation if you use affine transformations so all those nice things you're gonna be fine them there ok so check those things are very useful anyhow so finally we figure out that if I have everything up here we have cut hippopotamus dogs and whatever I want to take them down I want to translate right yes talk to me no you don't talk yet ok all right so we want to use translation and then you translate this in the z-row so you have all the things here then how do you separate those things apart so all of them are tall together how can i we mentioned what are the five different a four different transformation that a linear transformation does scaling right how do you scale things with a diagonal matrix fantastic cool right so fantastic so how do we diagonalize matrices ha that is the second question you can figure out if you check Twitter so we open a new page we go Twitter again we go on top right should take a note about how to do this stuff you don't SVD parentheses from all the NZ okay cool now you go if you go here is like or SVD so this is from also Gilbert right so you also like to check these on if you click here it's gonna be more information about me term right last year oh okay you know too much no okay anyhow so you want to check this stuff out anyhow we'll figure out that by using matrices and scalars you can move things around and then you can zoom right and so again I have things all collapsed here I can't do anything so I take it down with a translation right yes no make do like that with your head no you follow in there yes no okay it's boring no okay alright so you take a reason you put it down with translation and then you zoom it right with a matrix perhaps diagonal with some singular values right cool cool cool and then what so I have this thing zoomed up though so classification what is it how do you perform classification now you I'd like you'd like to assign labels but how do you do that so whatever you would like to do is going to be basically moving these points in different regions and then you slice them okay and so this is problem is gonna be part of the next class and now I'm just showing you how a neural network does this I hope you're gonna be enjoying this video if I find my cursor okay so all right so we start from here for screen perhaps all right so can you see anything no how do you turn off the lights can someone figure out how to oh maybe here yes no good night hold on all right good night so at least then I'd turn it back so here we start with these five branches of a spiral and you can see that each point is gonna be basically represented as what how can you represent each of those points without the color okay where do these points live on a 2d plane right so this is a 2d plane this screen here so each of those points is represented as a is a tuple right that is representing the X and the y coordinate then the color there represents a third dimension where it's going to be basically representing the class to which each of those points belong and here we have five different branches of a spiral so this is the input to my network is going to be a bunch of points without colors and then I ask my network to separate the points by color okay is it clear what is the task I ask my network you can authorize your hands because I cannot I cannot see it right so so you have to shout back because I don't see you you understand right what's going on here if sorry not right now so we start with this guy here which is just five branches of a spiral the network doesn't see the colors right now and the network will try to separate the colors apart so this is what my network does it takes the space the space space fabric and it performs like a stretching of the space fabric right how cool does that sound and you should do like oh oh see okay yeah we had to do multiple iterations I think here this your first class it's okay to be shy alright so this is my network which is basically stretching the space fabric in order to get all those points that are belonging to the same color to the same class to be in the same subspace of this final manifold such that once we reach convergence so whenever we reach at the end of this animation you have all your points that belongs to different spirals very separable and so now you can just use logistic regression right or like one versus all whatever regression is called yeah I don't know so I mean this is the last matrix is represented by that that for five arrows there so of those five arrows represent a matrix which is how many rows how many columns so what is my output dimension here of this network what are we trying to infer in this case the classes how many classes do we have five so the number of rows of this matrix will be five right because they are height of the matrix is they the same dimension where you shoot in two and the width of the matrix represents the space where you're shooting from right and so what is going to be what's going to be my width of this matrix - right so this matrix is going to be a high times two because we are shooting towards five dimensions the five colors over here and then we have to two columns right so it's gonna be basically the two coordinates of the tip of the arrow and those are just centered in zero we're going to talk about more about that intersection I guess in later lessons if I actually may manage to make a video about that but can you see that kind of cute intersection at the center have you ever seen that kind of intersection before have you ever taken a bath I mean oh yeah bubbles right so whenever you have multiple bubbles touching together it looks like similar to that perhaps maybe not that I don't know it looks to me alright so that was the first Network okay and this is how this network work these networks basically take the space fabric and then apply some kind of transformation which is still parametrized by matrices so I have many many matrices then I have nonlinearities why do I need many matrices or why do I need nonlinearities can I turn on the light oh you still like to watch okay yeah otherwise start flipping all right so so here it basically this guy here is gonna be a network with two matrices my first matrix Maps my input which is living in which space two dimensions to a intermediate layer of 100 dimensions so my network architecture is the following so I have my two neurons here I met this one two one two three so on here I have 100 then I have some non-linearity which is going to be just the positive part and then from this guy here I do something cute or funny or weird I don't know depends so from here I map down to okay what should I do after let's say this is this is my network what's gonna be the last layer of this network Phi right but how many dimension has this screen so how can I plot I don't say PCIe so I do listen okay such that I can show you there the intervener interpolation between this point here which I call embedding in this case but just a way I call this stuff right now and my input okay alright that's pretty much it so this is my neural network has one input layer one hidden layer one kind of embedding layer which does nothing and a output layer okay so it has one hidden and overall I count this as three layer neural network exact because it is one two and then this stuff is linear right so why do we need nonlinearities and what can one layer okay said without non-linearity it would look like a single layer neural network and a single layer neural net or what can you do scaling translation rotation the reflection and I guess shearing right okay so I guess what's going to be the next part of this class let's let's check how one one linear one network with one layer works okay questions so far also there in the yeah for just displaying stuff on the screen more questions again don't raise hands you can just talk to me can you hear me the over there is everything okay awesome alright thank you for approval so these two points here represent the coordinates of my input points right so this is gonna be my x-coordinate my y-coordinate of the input space this one is going to be my x-coordinate and my y-coordinate of these embedding space which is linearly separable given that I have you know I am obtained 100% accuracy with the training we haven't talked about training yet but does it make any sense the answer what I gave you okay yeah so this is just a way to visualize five dimensions in two dimensions instead of doing a PCA I just do a PCA hold on hasn't finished because I'd like to see what the network output looks like in two dimensions okay why is that true or is that false you see that next time it doesn't shrink because again those two you can see multiply them together right it looks like one singular matrix one single matrix and actually this works better more about this later on in the class actually on is going to be touching about this okay we still have some time all right so how did I make these animations first option I'm a magician while you're laughing it's actually true but anyhow I know how to use matplotlib I've taken this class three times and I never pass it okay all of those are three three all the three are true I never taken the class but okay I mean I've been on the other side yes so this is not magic right so this is just visualization using matplotlib free open source code in an PI torch which is going to be our library which are going to be using for the right in these models it's very it's very very convenient was made by a student of mine back I guess in 2016 so you know be that cool I'm just kidding you can be even more cool all right more questions now okay so now we actually can go to the more concrete part right so this was kind of abstract I gave you some interesting you know delicious I guess appetizer let's get on the main course and let's see how you can actually get started okay so everything you're gonna be seen in my classes or in my github repository which you are gonna be forced to start now I'm just kidding but if you don't start it I will take notice all right get up calm \/add cold so it cold stays for something weird so my Italian name is alfredo Fredo can mean cold and Al can name it so that it cold is gonna be like kind of transliteration of my name so it cold you go there yet it's me how cute and the first one with one thousand and three hundred stars and I guess you have two hundred so I should be 1500 by tonight it's not the class repository for for the class right and so you're gonna be if you don't have so you should have like a UNIX I actually know my torch works or something on Windows I don't use Windows so I have no idea but if you have a Mac or a Linux machine everything works just fine if you have a Windows it should work as well I haven't tried so how do you access this stuff you go there here you're gonna have the the page website as soon as we actually make it we are going to be actually looking at the reporte sorry did in the notebook number two right now if we have time left we can also check a bit of a more basic introduction to the tensor tutorial how many of you have no idea what numpy or numpy whatever you want to call it is ends up don't be shy so I changed my question now do does everyone here in class know about numpy and has it used before is it are you gonna be shaking your hand just shake your head right so who is no whatsoever idea what numpy is and how it works and never use Python before you know it happened don't don't laugh okay because if you don't know about that there is also the zero zero class where you implement things from scratch but I guess there's too much back so I guess the number one it perhaps is not too worthy going over we see if we have some time left it basically gives you some introduction about how to use basic high torques routines for creating tensors which are basically multi-dimensional arrays in an amp I and so it creates tensors multiply tensors it just initialize create random stuff so it's it's not that different from numpy again we can check them out if we can check this out if we have some time afterwards otherwise it's gonna be like left as an assignment to go over this it should be very easy gentle introduction to how to get started with the API ok complains about this no wow are you shy or you're too nice ok you're not laughing ok all right so ok I'm joking but you're not getting the jokes is fine one more advertisement is type aura this type or a thing I love it so much is a markdown editor where you can write down your notes in latex and markdown right so you can write for example you know whatever soft arcamax which is something you're going to be learning about which I call it this way so you can use latex in a markdown file it looks very good for example I here i annotate articles I I read okay so this is called pipe or and typ o RA okay that's just you know promotional message I don't get paid so you know it's Franco okay all right so how do we get started there we open the terminal we zoom such that you can see something so we can go for example inside or this is going to be different let's say we go inside that fall inside that repository icon somewhere else which is gonna be my notebooks and then my video something video lessons okay so you're going to be basically running Conda activate deep learning mini course and everything just works if you have installed and you have followed the instructions in the readme okay so right now if you just type ipython ipython with pylab it open you can do import torch for example just to see whether everything works and then you can type for example torch dot R and and five and this one is going to be typing creating a tensor with five number which are randomly picked from zero to one uniform distribution okay so this is just to check that everything just works fine if this works then we can actually start and playing with the notebooks you're not kind of I mean you can try to follow along in class with the computer but I rather I think it's better for you to actually follow and what I do here you know I'm a clown I try to engage with you if you isolate yourself with the computer maybe sometimes you may lose some of some of the nuggets I give you anyhow so it looks like everything works here so I'm gonna be just opening the Jupiter notebook and things are black because I like them this way yeah black is good alright so we're gonna see this random projection to be starting so yeah I'm let me go fullscreen you should be complaining if you don't see things right I kind of know what you see what you don't know what you see what you don't see but if you provide feedback live like I can't read anything or can you turn off the light that would be also useful okay so do interrupt me to talk to me can you see is he okay yes no thank you all right let me turn off that one - all right okay so I do here I just what I do here I'm gonna just import some utilities I find for plotting stuff then here I just import torch and then from torch I import this NN library which is simply I'm gonna be importing the matrix multiplication and the addition of our vector okay so matrix multiplication is gonna be a linear operation plus the bias but plus the translation we have the affine transformation which is the one we were talking about with the five different transformations and then we're going to be important I guess some nonlinear function somewhere moreover I import from applet leave those things for plotting things I also important um pipe is NP non pine on PI I don't know is it numpy number or Mumbai with numeric people complain about the atom anyhow so I use some default things and okay this is the first line torch specific line so this is gonna be device equal torch dot device CUDA 0 if CUDA is available otherwise CPU what is this if I am running these examples on a chip on a machine which has a GPU automatically porch will run on the GPU memory so your machine has a CPU which makes only sequential operations one after each other musty might be very very very fast but it still sequential right it's like your brain you can only do one thing at a time if you try to drive and smoke and funk take a phone call yeah you might not be here tomorrow so you can only do one thing at a time right and it's like the CPU of a computer and then you have some local memory which is the main memory is called RAM random access memory on the other side if you would like to speed up things you can use something that is much slower which is called GPU so why would you use a GPU which is slower than a CPU to speed up your computations because although it's very very much slower it can perform many many many more computation at the same time right so if the CPUs might be like like running very quickly from one side to the other it's gonna be beating your GPU so many times but the GPU does okay alright so the GPU will have a memory which is called device memory which is which lives on the GPU I think right now they are planning to get some access to the main memory of the CPU from the GPU I think they are working on that I don't think it's yet out anyhow if you work on the GPU you will have to create your tensors in the jeep you maintain the in the GPU memory but you don't have to worry about that as long as you specify that thing over there at the beginning of your code my torch will take care and will put your tensors in the right location for you if you're going to be using ATP you a tensor processing unit from Google similarly you're gonna have pi torch putting your tensors in the tip q memory which is close to the actual processing unit there which is going to make your operation you know computed in a faster way so this is a stupid single line but it's important okay again about the PI torch stuff you won't be tested in the midterm midterm is going to be mostly about math this study is going to be essential for actually managing to succeed in the final project okay so if you are trying to beat others while using CPUs and they are using GPUs you know good luck okay and yeah I'm ironic but you know people tried and and then complain and then I don't want complaints okay alright so here we create 1,000 points and actually I do this one okay so one underscore zero zero zero is the same as one thousand but it's better to read and so here I have 1,000 points and my X capital X is gonna be my design matrix it's gonna be having 1,000 rows and two columns okay and it's sampled from our random and distribution so if you go here you press shift tab you're going to be having this thing opening up and you can click here you're gonna see what is this stuff right so R and R on the end is gonna be able to turn a tensor field with random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 also called the standard normal distribution okay so how did I open the help do you know this stuff have you ever used notebooks before is the first time you saw this help you know some of you may have seen this the first time ok so how are these capital X going to be looking like how are these set of points what what is your expectation for this set of points you're supposed to interact small values near to zero okay so you're going to have a cloud of points what is going to be the radius of your cloud it's again no I'm just speaking since I don't like distributions I'm gonna have like a bunch of points which are going to be basically somehow circularly distributed I'd like to know what is the average radius of this blob 1\/2 Warfare's more or less zero average so you have the expectation of the square of the X square right square root of the expectation but whatever like expectation of the square root of the sum of the squares right okay someone said 1\/2 cool guys once more who beats more second that that or 1 so you have the standard deviation is gonna be 1 so are you gonna get points outside of the standard deviation or not you know the bell curve right where is the one standard deviation close to the center far away how much larger than the standard deviation is the bell okay roughly try to guess just shoot numbers it's okay I don't judge you yet no you too shy okay where is my student answer I can't find you fine not fine okay there we go what is this stuff it's cute I know can you see anything let me should I lower it okay I just lowered the light whatever people with Eric in the recording are gonna be complaining but okay still I don't know how to turn off the first thing so you got get dark so what are those red and green arrows there okay you can you can guess right I don't bite you the axe is fantastic which axis what is the length of those things come on you need right so those are the unit vectors Y y1 is red one while the other is green okay fantastic which one is X which one is Y X is the red one why is that because you have RGB and right because you have taken some graphic just before this so R is gonna be always right is gonna be always the x-axis green is gonna be always the y-axis those are unit vectors and therefore this cloud of points spends roughly what is the average radius here can you guess more or less three fantastic that was the answer okay so you have a cloud of points roughly large three right uniformly like circularly distribute the rain sort of all right cool so we're gonna run now you can try to put like this arrow here one more arrow here one more arrow here you have three arrows there okay more or less I'm a physicist right yeah later I will be mortician okay now I'm a mathematician so realizing you know transformations see here I compute the SVD singular value decomposition again there's the video I pointed out before so I'm gonna be multiplying this this cloud of point by a matrix so what does the matrix do to these circular blob come on you know this stuff you will be repeated three times so far what do you expect to see you have a circle here what do you expect to see afterwards a potato yes correct so first potato and this is a very squished one so why is he what's happen here what's happen in the y-direction all right so how is this matrix it's a cute matrix is the rotation matrix is an annoying matrix how are the eigen what are the singular values look look here one singular value is almost close to 0 right so this is our almost singular matrix so this is what's happening it's gonna kill one dimension this one didn't kill it yet but basically you have that the dimensions in the diagonal right in the singular value decomposition represent the amount of zooming you have in the different direction and then the first two matrices the first and the last one represent the rotation that these metrics apply this other one has a factor of two in one direction and the zero six in the other one so you get this stuff here Oh something else hold on so here you have blue green yellow red right so our our G alone no there is no order here we have blue green yellow red and then here you have blue red yellow green so what's happened here how's the determinant negative why is that because you had a reflection that's correct all right I'll keep going you can see here different things right so you have more potatoes here and this is actually zooming a lot you have one point three this also is kind of zooming a little okay this one does nothing okay boring right oh okay what's happen here how are these metrics it's gonna be singular right almost you can see the one singular value is gonna be zero point zero three it's very tiny you can see these are the unit vectors there are very big arrows here means it has squashed down right the first one is 0 6 the other one is 0 0 3 so you can basically almost killed a dimension here and so on okay so no much stuff anyhow you can do the same things with PI torch now so this can be the first instruction you're gonna be seen about pi torch so here I do model is going to be a sequential which is basically a container where I can put a few a few modules one after each other and my first module is going to be a NN linear which means what does and then linear means doesn't mean a linear transformation because these people were guest programmers so you know they don't know I guess this is an affine transformation but actually it's a linear transformation because I said bias equals false okay so this is actually just a matrix multiplication so it is a linear transformation okay maps to 0 to 0 then I do model to device I ship the model to the memory of the GPU and then I remove the gradients you're gonna figure out this next week what it is I'm gonna bet get here my Y is gonna be the output of the model to which I input the X then I generate my figure and I plot this stuff so this is to show you that you can also get a singular matrix with the pie tours how cool is this no it's boring right I mean you can see you can multiply data by matrix matrices by using the PI torch package and so we had to create a model sequential container we put inside the linear module we remove the bias the translation and you get this stuff why did I remove the translation because otherwise I had to fetch it and it goes outside the screen so I keep it in the center okay all right so let's have this one so right now I'm gonna just use the following I just use a matrix that is I think I didn't pick curl no it's gonna be identity matrix which I scale both items in the diagonal by the same item by the same value and then I apply a nonlinear function so my nonlinear function is gonna be the following it's a hyperbolic tangent which goes to minus 1 roughly when you cross the minus 2.5 here at the bottom and it goes to to put goes to one roughly whenever you cross the plus 2.5 okay up here so this stuff Maps what the whole real line to wear so plus infinity goes to one and minus infinity goes to until you reach the linear region which is roughly minus two point five to two point five why do I mention this name in these numbers because sometimes you're gonna put your nose inside your model it is not training and you still want to figure out the order of magnitude and you know the rough the number which are kind of associated to the kink of these nonlinearities anyhow so I just create this one which is very very similar to the thing I just show you before which has where is it here so here I have my sequential which is the sequence of operations I use a matrix first so this linear to two then I applied the tonnage and then I increased the I think the multiplier for that diagonal matrix so that's what you get so this is my cloud what do you expect to see of my cloud so what is the range of this cloud we said it's roughly it goes from minus 3 to plus 3 right where is the kink happening so everything that is outside these two point five minus two point five two plus two point five box is going to be mapped to one things that are inside stay roughly the same that's correct so what do you expect to see after this image over here you expect to have inbox your data but what is going to be the size of this box are you sure so the the suggestion was from minus two point five to two point five the box is going to be 2 minus 1 2 plus 1 so minus 1 minus 1 I mean all the box from minus 1 to plus 1 but then the points inside are going to be mapped according to the mapping we were mentioning before so things from minus two point five to two point five are getting linearly squeezed and then things outside at two point five number are going to be squashed down to the basically edge of this box okay are you ready to see how to box a normal distribution are you excited okay just two people just said that I mean are we excited come on give me some satisfaction okay you're not playing with me okay I see I'm trying to be nice to you oh oh thank you at least at work right so that was first one so in this case here I'll just show you just my identity matrix I didn't do anything and here things are kind of what kind of distribution looks this I mean what what does it look like come on oh it's a uniform kind of between minus 1 to plus 1 fantastic in 2d what does it happen now if I start doing a little bit if I start multiplying instead of having identity matrix now I have the 2 2 matrix or 3 3 or 4 455 again the points will go for further to the edges so you're gonna be seeing these and these and these and finally this huh oh hey Kuno so what happens here we met by our cloud it was like circular into this kind of boxy thing how good is that now those little points are very very spread apart and so you can actually tell them apart if you are for example classifying stuff finally in the last minute then I do let you go it's going to be using random matrices but in this way so here I'm gonna have my sequential I put like a linear layer which also has the bias terms is affine transformation I go from two to this hidden layer dimension which is going to be five so I go to two to five I applied the Rideau which is simply the positive part operator and then I apply another affine transformation that goes to five to two such that I can display them on the screen okay is it clear what I'm doing so I create a sequential which is a sequence of modules I have three modules the first module is a matrix mapping matrix of height five with two so it shoots towards high dimensions it from a to two dimensional input space there is a bias which is going to be Phi dimensional then you remove you set to zero everything that is negative and now you map this Phi dimensional space whatever down to two dimensions so you're gonna have a matrix that has two rows and five columns and then there is a bias of height like of size two okay did you follow if you didn't follow you can find in the recording because I'm gonna play press play are you ready mmm okay some engagement okay it didn't work sorry okay okay fantastically they know I did so this is the beginning right that's the starting point and then you get yes you're allowed to do oh it's fine oh oh this is all right this is very spiky so you're gonna figure out in the next class what happened here but this is a very different thing right this is this smooth transformations somehow smooth this is very very angular right and design and how cute is this right so finally final remarks and then I let you go I know it's dinner time for sorry for keeping you here to me if late so final remarks are the following then yeah check the Piazza so this is basically a untrain neural network those I just show you in the module with the three items the linear transformation positive part the end transformation or affine transformation is your first linear deep neural network it's not that deep but still makes pretty damn awesome drawings I think in my opinion so I'm like a just initialize network an untrained Network we start with this kind of transformation but we have seen from the first video I show you tonight that we are aiming for a transformation which is you know instrumental to perform a specific task which is for example the classification of those points that are belonging to the different five spiral so in the next class we're going to figure out how do I take this initial you know arbitrary transformation and I can pull it apart and manipulate such that I achieve the final goal which is for example make my points linearly separable in the final layer okay so this is gonna be for the next class otherwise stay warm and I see you next time bye-bye","OrBEon3VlQg":"so since last time okay welcome back thank you for being here last time yang was using the tablet right and how can you use the tablet I don't use the tablet right so I should be as cool as the Anna at least I think one more thing to begin with there is a spreadsheet where you can decide whether you'd like to join the slack channel where we collaborate over making like some drawings for the website fixing some mathematical notations having some kind of you know fixing the error in English in the English grammar or whatever so if you if you're interested in a help in improving the content of this class feel free to fill out the spreadsheet okay we are already a few of us on the slug channel so I mean if you want to join if we are you're welcome so instead of writing on the whiteboard because it's impossible to see I think from the upper side we're gonna be going to experiment with a new toy here all right first time so you know I'm a little bit tense last time I screw up with a notebook so okay alright so we're gonna be talking starting with a small review about linear algebra I hope I'm not offending anyone I'm aware that you already taken linear algebra and you're very strong in it but nevertheless I'd like to provide you my intuition my perspective okay it's just you know one slide not too much so maybe you'd like to take out some paper and pen or you can just you know whatever follow along so so this one is going to be linear and linear algebra review okay am i waiting a little bit let me wait for a sec ready yes no shake your head okay fantastic alright so we were talking last time we had a neural network with the input on the bottom then we had like an affine transformation then we have a hidden layer right so I'm gonna just write the first equation we're gonna have that my hidden layer and since I'm writing on with a pen can you see anything yeah so since I'm writing with a pen I'm going to be putting a underscore underneath the variable in order to indicate it's a vector okay that's how I write vectors so my H is gonna be a nonlinear function f apply to my Z and Zed is gonna be my linear input okay the linear when the output of the affine transformation so in this case I'm gonna be writing here Z is going to be equal to my matrix a times X okay we can imagine there is no bias in this case it's generic enough because we can include it bias inside the matrix and have the first item of the X equal to B 1 so if this X here belongs to RN and is dead here belongs to RM first question what is the size of this matrix okay fantastic right so this matrix here is gonna be our M times n you have as many rows as the dimension where you should - and you have as many columns the dimension where you're shooting from ok all right so let's expand this one right so this matrix here is gonna be equal to what do you have a 1 1 a 1 2 so on until the last one which is gonna be shout thank you 1 and yeah 1n then you have second one's gonna have 1 a 2 1 a 2 2 so on until the last one which is 2 n right and then you keep going down until the last one which is going to be what are the indexes M 1 right okay so you had a and 1 a M 2 and so on until amen okay thank you all right and then we have here our X right so you have X 1 X 2 and so on until xn right you're more responsive than last year good thank you alright so we can also rewrite this one in different ways so the first way I'm gonna write this one is gonna be the following so I'm gonna have here these a 1 then I'm gonna have here my a 2 and then I have the last one which is gonna be my a and ok and then here I'm gonna be multiplying this by a column vector right so my column vector I'm gonna be write it like this alright so what is the output of this operation so these are metrics you have a vector the outcome is going to be a vector so what is gonna be the first item of my vector I don't use dots because I'm not a physicist actually I am that we are doing linear algebra so what should I write alright so that's already transpose because those are a row vector so I just write a I'm gonna just mean just right right so I have a 1 X ok so there is no transposition here no dots around and so on second element is gonna be a two okay X and then until the last one which is gonna be D okay there's no dot but sure like someone is calling that dot product instead of the cross product but that is assumes like you use a different kind of notation all right so and this is gonna be my so how many elements does this vector have M okay so we have Z 1 Z 2 and so on until Z M and this is my final set right my vector is that okay fantastic so now we are going to be focusing a little bit about the meaning of this thing over here okay other questions so far all right this is very trivial so far I hope I mean let me know if if not okay okay so let's analyze one of these guys here so I'd like to figure out what is the meaning of writing a T times X right so my a T is gonna be my generic a I so let's assume in this case when n equal to okay so what is ATX so ATX is going to be equal to what so let me draw here something so that is gonna be easier for you to understand so this one is gonna be my a are these gonna be my alpha and then here you have like it's gonna be my X and is this gonna be here my X I so what is this what is the output of this product here these are here see you can sorry 8\/8 transpose it let's call it let's say that is a row vector can you see know what is gonna be the output of this operation here no why this is this is like a generic one of the many aids right there are M aids this is one of those mas so I'm multiplying one of those A's times my X right let's assume there are only two dimensions so what is gonna be the output of this scalar product can someone tell me no no no like normal scalar product hold on so you have egg hey here do you have here this part here is gonna be a 1 it is gonna be a two okay then you have here x1 and now you have x2 right so how do you express this scalar product here okay so I'm just writing let me know if you took clear so I'm gonna write here a 1 times X 1 plus a 2 times X 2 right this is the definition clear right so far yeah no okay yeah question yeah that is meant to be a transpose Y a role times column vector so let's assume a is a column vector then I have role x colouring so let's keep writing this stuff here so what is a 1 how can i compute AI a 1 second ok ok so I'm gonna write here the a 1 is going to be the length of vector a times cosine alpha then what about X 1 someone else the same right now wait what what is X 1 same thing right different letters so someone say something you're following you're completely confused you're not having any idea it's too easy I have no idea what's going on here it's good right so far ok what's gonna be the second term the this one is gonna be X here write x cos x I right and then you had the second term which is going to be what magnitude of a shout I can hear ok sine of alpha and then okay thank you okay all right I'm gonna be just putting together those two guys so you're gonna get equal magnitude of a times magnitude of x times cosine alpha cosine Phi plus sana sine alpha and sine cosine a sine X I sorry what is be starting the parentheses all right so there's the cosine of the difference of the two angle right everyone knows trigonometry here right sorry high school stuff so this one is gonna be equal to a x times the cosine of cos x i minus alpha right oh the other way around right from monoxides so what does this mean you can think about each element so far is clear I I didn't do any magic yeah shake your head like these four yes these four no this for maybe no something's working okay so you can think about whenever you multiply a matrix times a vector that basically each output of this operation is gonna be measuring so okay hold on what is this cosine how much is cosine of zero one so it means if these two angles if the two vectors are aligned which means there is a zero angle between the two vectors you can have the maximum value of this element right whenever when you have the minus the most negative value when they are opposite right so when they're in opposition of phase you're gonna get the most negative magnitude but then if you apply just let's a redo you're gonna cut all those negative things you're just checking for the positive matches right so neural net basically just perhaps who's gonna be figuring out only the positive matches right and so again when you multiply a matrix times a column vector you be performing element-wise sorry scalar product between each column each row of the matrix which represents your kernel right so whenever you have like a linear layer your kernel is gonna be the whole row of the matrix and now you see what is the projection of that input on that column I am on the input on that flow right so each element of this product is going to tell you the alignment with which the input is what is the alignment of the input with respect to the specific row of the matrix okay yes no this should shape some more like intuition while we are using these linear transformations they are like allowing you to see the projection of the input onto different kind of orientations let's say this way okay you can try to you know extrapolate this in high dimensions I guess the intuition at least I can give it to you works definitely in two and three dimensions in higher dimensions I kind of think it works in a similar way next lesson we are going to watch we are actually we are going to see how what is the distribution of the projections in a higher dimensional space is this sort gonna be so cool I think all right so this was the first part of I think of the class oh well there is one more more part so actually here this said here we can also write it in a different way so maybe this is maybe it's known maybe it's not known when I saw it first time I didn't know so you know it's it's cool that sometimes you see these things once again maybe so let's go back here is the things that there and so you can express this Z as being equal the vector a 1 in this case a 1 is gonna be the first column of the a matrix ok and this one is going to be multiplied by the scalar x1 now you have the second column of the matrix so I have a 2 this is multiplied by the second element of the X right until the last one which is gonna be again I can't hear if it's M or n m like this or end you know sign language which one n right you know sign language no you should learn it's good you know inclusivity a and write the last column times your X and of course because n X has a size of n there are n items right and so basically when you also when you do a you know transformation a linear you know apply a linear operator you can't be basically waiting each column of the matrix with the coefficient that is in a you know you have first column times the first coefficient of the vector second column and by the second item plus third column times the third item and so you can see the output of this DN transformation is a weighted sum of the columns of the a matrix okay so this is a different kind of intuition sometimes you see these as like whenever you want to express your signal your data is a combination of different you know the composition this is kind of a linear composition of your input alright so that was the first part it is the recap about the linear algebra a second part is going to be something even more cool I think questions so far no easy too easy you're getting bored sorry okay all right then I'm gonna speed up I guess alright so let's see how we can extend the one that the stuff we have seen right now to convolutions right so maybe convolution sometimes are a little bit weird let's see how we can do an extension to convolutions all right so let's say I start with the same matrix so I'm gonna have here four rows and then three columns okay so my data has to be if I had if I had this matrix if I multiply this to a column my column vector should be of size three thank you all right so let me draw here my column vector of size right and this is gonna give you a output of size four okay fantastic but then is your data let's say you're gonna listen to some nice audio audio file is your data just three simple long how long is gonna be your data let's say you listening to a piece of music that is like three minutes how many sample does three minutes of all your health yeah I guess what is gonna be my sampling rate let's say twenty two okay twenty two thousand kilo Hertz right 22 kilohertz so how many samples three minutes of music have second you sure is monophonic or stereophonic just kidding okay so you're gonna multiply the number of sample the number of seconds right number of seconds times the frame rate right the okay the frequency in this case anyhow so this signal is gonna be very very long right it's gonna be keep going down so if I have a vector that is very very long I have I have to use a matrix which is gonna be very very fat wide right okay fantastic so this top keeps going this direction alright so my question for you is gonna be what should I put in this location here what should I put here so do we care about things that are further away no why not because our data has the property of locality fantastic so what am I gonna go what am I gonna be putting here a big zero right fantastic mom okay so we put a zero here and then what is the other property so let me start drawing this stuff again right so can I have my kernel of size three and then here I have my data which is gonna be very long right so hold on I can see all right so here there are zero then let's say what is the other property my my my date my natural data have stationarity which means the pattern that you expect to find this can be kind of repeating over and over again right and so if I have here my three values here perhaps I'd like to reuse them over and over again right and so if these three values let me change the color maybe so you can see in there is the same stuff so I have three values here and then I'm gonna be using these three same values one step for the rain and I keep going further I don't down and I keep going this way all right so what should I put here on the bottom what should I put here a zero right why that why is that because of locality of the data right so putting zeros around is called it's also called padding but in this case it's called sparsity right so this is like sparsity and then the replication of this thing that is over and over over again it's called session I'd was the property of the signal this is called weight sharing yeah okay fantastic all right so how many how many values do we have now how many parameters I have on the right hand side well so we have three parameters over left on the left hand side instead we had product right so if the right side is gonna be easy is the right side gonna work at whole you have three parameters one side on the other side you have 12 okay that is good using locality and spiral and whatever not like sparsity and parameter sharing but then now we end up with just three parameters isn't this too restrictive how can we have multiple multiple parameter what's missing here in the big picture there are multiple channels right so this is just one layer here and then you have this stuff coming out from the from the from the board here so you have the first kernel down here now he has some second kernel let's say listen and I have last one here right and so you have each plane of these metrics being containing just one kernel which is replicated multiple times who knows the name of this matrix now so this is gonna be called triplets top list matrix okay so what is the main feature of these topless metrics what is the big big big thing that you won't notice it's a sparse matrix okay okay what is gonna be here this first item over here what is the content of the first guy yeah so this one here is gonna be the extension of my linear transformation which was you know I have a signal that is longer than three samples therefore I have to make this matrix fatter second part is might be given that I don't care about what things like things that are here down I don't care about things that are here if I look at the points that are up here so gonna be putting a big 0 here such that Oh everything that is down here it gets cleaned up right and then finally I'm gonna be using the same kernel over and over again because I assume that my data is stationary and therefore I assume that similar patterns are gonna be happening over and over again therefore I'm gonna be using this one which is written here parameter sharing weight sharing finally given that this one gives you only three parameter two parameters to work with I will use several layers in order to have different you know channels so this one is one kernel before one kernel was the whole row of the matrix okay so when you have a fully connected layer the only difference between a fully connected layer and a convolution is that you have the full dam row of the matrix so what is gonna be in this first item over here anyone so the green colonel let's call the green corner just a one let me actually make it glow green because it's green karna so you have a one times what it's gonna be from the number one to number three right and then the second item is gonna be same same dude here a 1 and then you're gonna have the X shifted by one and so on right make sense yeah and then we're gonna have this one is going to be the green output then you're gonna have the blue output one layer coming out and then you have the further one the red one coming we've been one layer out okay what's the iPad experience cool yes no I liked it okay other questions so again the blue circle this one it's a big zero that's the sparsity one the same is here yes no yeah yeah yeah green so here I just put a lot of zeros inside here so I killed all the values that are away from the little part and then I repeat the same three values over and over again because I expect to find the same pattern in different regions of this is the big big signal I have this one here so I said that in this case I'm gonna have just three values right and we started with 12 values and I ended up with 3 which is really really little so if I'd like to have let's say 6 values then if I want to have six values and I can have my second 3 on a different plane and I perform the same operation whenever you multiply this matrix times a vector you perform a convolution so it just to tell you that a convolution is just a matrix multiplication with a lot of zeros that's it yeah so they're gonna have this one here then you have a second one you have a third one so you have three versions of the input alright so for a second part of the class I'm gonna be showing you some more interactive things please do participate to the second part as well alright so let's try so I have rebranded I have rebranded the website and now has slightly some like that the environment is going to be called P PBL so pi torch deep learning instead of sleep learning mini course it was too long so let me start by running this one so my torch deep learning so we can do this Conda activate activate PI torch deep learning and then let's open not the Jupiter notebook all right so now you're gonna be watching the going over the listening to corners so I show you a convolution on paper well on my tablet now got me making listening to convolution so can such that you can really appreciate what this compositions are here we said a the new kernel right which is called P PBL Python sleep learning so you're gonna notice the same kind of you know procedure if you update your system alright so in this case we can read the top here so let me hide the top here alright so given the assumption of locality stationarity and composition compositionality we can reduce the amount of computation for a matrix vector multiplication by using a sparse because local popplets matrix because stationary scheme in this way we can simply end up rediscovering the convolution operator array moreover we can also recall that a scalar product is a simply a normalized cosine distance which tells us the alignment of two vectors more specifically we compute the magnitude of the orthogonal projection of two vectors onto the other and vice versa so let's figure out now how all these can make sense by using our ears okay so i'm going to be importing a library that professor here at NYU made and here I'm gonna be just loading my audio data and I'm gonna have that in my X and then my sampling grade is going to be in the other variable so here I'll just show you I'm gonna have like 70,000 samples in this case because I have a simple in rate of 22 kilo Hertz and then my total time is gonna be three seconds okay so three seconds times 22 you get what so it's not 180 you were saying it was a hundred and eighty was three right oh it was three minutes oh you're right it's three seconds so you actually are correct my dad so this is three seconds so times 22 kilo Hertz you get 17 roughly some 70,000 samples here I'm gonna be important some libraries to show you something and then I'm gonna be showing you the first chart so this is the audio signal I have imported right now how does it look like wavy okay cool can you tell me how it sounds that was a good guess the guess was you can tell is actually what's the content right from this diagram because the amplitude of like the the the y-axis here is gonna be showing you just the amplitude can I turn off the light is okay or you're you sure okay thank you I really dislike this like okay goodnight Oh see how nice it is okay cool alright so you can't tell anything here right you can't not tell what is the what is the sound right so how can we figure out what is the sound inside here so for example I can show you a transcript over the sound and actually let me let me actually force these in your in your your head right so you're gonna have hold on your network all right so now we actually heard it okay so now you can actually see ting ting ting boom you know you can kind of imagine a little bit but okay so what notes did we play there like how can I figure out what put out the notes that they are inside so I'm gonna be showing this one so since this is a bit brighter I can see your faces how many of you can not read this oh ouch okay so let me let me see if I can help us out here okay the connection would help please alright let me try to thank you all right how cool is that thank you it took four lessons for you to clap nice oh now this is very nice of you let's keep going and you fly because between the first a frequencies is that the first a thin flap maybe twice the frequency as the other figure out what is the frequency of that and then we're gonna be sine is that we have vehicle payment and so we're gonna have a a flap in our shop so if we put all together we gonna get season all right simple no yep thank you bye-bye okay seeing this took a whole damn day to prepare I was so nervous before come here I'm so happy now I can actually go to sleep later anyhow so this was like in the first part you're gonna have the first note there's a flap that you have a b-flat a-flat and B so you have the and the difference between the first pitch and is one octave there for the first frequency is gonna be twice the second frequency okay so whenever we're gonna be observing the waveform one sign will have to a shorter like the half the period of the other one right the especially the the a the a flat on top is gonna have a period which is half of the period of the a on the bottom one right so you have okay if you go half of this one you get right okay okay so how do we actually get these notes out from that spectra from the from the waveform who can tell me how can I extract these pitches these frequencies from the other signal any guess okay a free transform that I think if are kind of a good guess what does it happen if I perform now a Fourier transform of that signal anyone can actually answer me you cannot raise your hand because I don't see just shout so if you basically perform the Fourier transform of the whole scene are you gonna hear like the whole notes together all together right but then you can't figure out which pitch is playing where or when actually in this case right ha so we need kind of a Fourier transform which is localized and so a localized Fourier transform in time or in space depending on whatever domain you are using its called spectrograph right and so on I'm gonna be now printing for you the spectrogram oh sorry and I'll be printing here the spectrogram of this one here and so here you can compare the two alright on the first part here on this side here you're gonna have this peak here at 1600 which is the the higher power there we go now you have a second one which is this peak here you can see this peak right and you see this peak yeah okay so these Peaks are gonna be the actual notes I play with the right hand so let's actually put those together and I'm gonna have here the frequencies so I have 1600 1200 and 800 can you see here I have 1600 and 800 Y one is double of the other because they are one octave apart so if this is this gonna be okay and this is a fifth which is like a also has a nice interval so then we actually generate these signals here and then I gotta be concatenate the mouth so I'm gonna be playing both these the first one is actually the original audio but [Music] let me try again the second one the concatenation yeah so it's a bit loud I can now cannot even reduce the volume oh I can reduce it here too much okay let me go again all right so this is the concatenation of these four different pitches so guess what we are going to be doing next so how can I extract all the notes that I can hear in a specific given piece so let's say I you play a full score and I'd like to know which pitch is play at what time of what so the answer was convolution just for the recording I'm asking convolution of what no convolutional spectrogram so you have convolution of your input signal with what with some different kind of pitches right which pitches will you pick let's say you don't see the spectrum because let's say I'm I just play any kind of piece of music so I'd like to know all possible notes they are there what would you do [Music] you don't know all pitches how would you try that right so in which are all the pitches you may want to use if you're if I'm playing the piano all the keys of the piano right so if I have if I play a concerto with the piano then I want to have like a piece of audio for each of those keys and I'm gonna be running convolutions of my whole piece with the old kids right and therefore you're gonna see hits which are the alignment of the cosine similarity whenever you get basic the audio matching your specific kernel so I'm gonna be doing this but with these specific tones I actually extract it here so here I'm going to be showing you first how the two spectrograms look like the left side is going to be the spectrogram of my actual signal X of T and on the right hand side I have just the spectrogram of this concatenation of my pitches so here you can clearly see this but then here is first of all what are these bars here these vertical bars you follow me right I can see you had to actually talk back what are these red bars here vertical bars now it don't tell van I already told you right these are and the vertical what what is it sampling issues right transitions so whenever you have deep you actually have one white waveform one waveform and then the other one one away from his to stop so it's no longer periodic and whenever you do a Fourier transform of a non periodic signal you get you know crop that's why whenever you get the junk to the junk junction between these the jump here you're gonna have this spike because it's gonna get basically you can think about the jump is like having a very high frequency right because it's a it's like a delta right so you actually get all the frequencies that's why you get all the frequencies here boom okay makes sense right so far kind of alright so this is the green version that I cannot even sign and what left side here why is on the left-hand side all red down there okay yes you know so the left side left hand the cold are the one I show you on the bottom left side okay so let me finish this class and then I'll let you go so here I'm gonna be convoyed show you first all the kernels you can tell now the red one is going to be the first chunk of my signal they want the real one and then you can see the first pitch is gonna be the has the same frequency can you see so the problem have the same same same delta T the same interval the same period can you see you cannot nod your head because again I don't see you had to answer me can you see or not okay thank you fantastic and so this one is that the third one you can see that it starts here in the period-- and it finishes here if you go up here you're gonna see exactly there were two of these guys right so that's why you can see that's how you can see this is like twice the frequency of the one below finally I'm gonna be performing the convolution of these four corners with my input signal and this is how we look like okay so the first kernel has a high match in the first part of the of the score so between zero and zero five seconds the second one starts just after after the first one then you have the third one starting at zero three I guess and then you have the last one starting at the zero six okay and so guess what I'm gonna make you listen to convolutions now are you excited oh okay you actually answering now good alright and so these are the outcomes let me lower a little the volumes otherwise you complain yeah I can't lower the okay so the first one let's try again how cool is that it's just listen to convolution okay so basically this was on I have one more slide because I felt like there was some confusion last time about what is the different dimensionality of different type of signals so I'm really recommending to go and take the class of young Bruna which is math for deep learning and I stole one of his you know small things he was teaching I just put a one slide here together for you so this slide is the following so okay so we have the input layer or the samples we provide into this network and so usually our last time I define this I have this curly X which is gonna be made of those x i's which are all my data same post right and so I usually have em there are samples so my I goes from n 1 to n ok so is this clear on is this notation clear because it's a bit more formal I use AMA less formal but then somehow someone was feeling a little bit not comfortable I think so this one is just my input samples but we we can also see this one is this curly X which is my input set as the set of all these functions as x i's which are mapping my Omega capital Omega which is my domain to a RC which are going to be basically my channels of that specific example in so here I'm gonna be mapping those lowercase Omega to these x i's of omega so let's see how these different this from the previous notation so I'm gonna give you now three examples and I you should be able to tell now what is the dimensionality and is all in this example so the first one let's say I have likely one and show you right now in the time just fun piece of you know audio signal so my Omega is going to be just the samples like sample number one sample number two like the index right so you have index one index to index until these 70,000 whatever we just saw right now okay and the last value is going to be the T capital T which is the number of seconds divided by the delta T which would be the you know 1 over the frequency and this is going to be a subset of n right so this is a discrete number of samples because you have a computer you always have discrete samples so this is my input data and then what about the image of this function so when I ask what is the dimensionality of this type of signal you should answer this is a one-dimensional signal because the power of these n here is 1 ok so this is like a 1 dimensional signal although you may have the total total time and sorry the 1 there it was a sampling interval on the right hand side you have the number of channels can be 1 if you have a mono signal you can have 2 if you have a stereophonic so you have mono there you have a 2\/4 stereophonic or what is 5 plus 1 that should all be like 5.1 how cool alright so this is still a one dimensional signal which may have multiple channels nevertheless is still one dimensional signal because there is only one running variable there ok is it somehow better than last time yes no better thank you let's say thanks to John alright second example I have here my Omega is going to be the Cartesian product of these two sets the first set is going to be going from 1 to the height and also this one in discrete and the other one is going to be going from 1 to the width so these are the actual pictures and so this one is a 2 dimensional signal because I have 2 different 2 degrees of freedom in my domain what are the possible channels we have so here the possible channels that are very very common are the following so you can have a grayscale image and therefore you only output one scrape one scalar value or you get the rainbow there the color and therefore you get like my X which is a function of the coordinates w1 sorry Omega 1 Omega 2 which is not be the each point is represented by a vector of three components which is gonna be the R component of the point Omega 1 Omega 2 the G component at Omega 1 Omega 2 and the blue component of Omega 1 Omega 2 so again you can all think about this as a big big data point or you can think about this as function mapping a low dimensional domain which is a two dimensional domain to a three dimensional domain right finally the twenty who who knows the name of the twenty channel image yeah this is a hyper spectral image it's very common to have a better than 20\/20 bandwidth but then sorry finally cooking gas this one my if my my domain is r4 x r4 what can it be no no this discrete right this is r4 so it's not even computer ha who said something that I heard yes is this correct so this is space-time what is the second one yeah which momentum has a special special name it's called for momentum because it has a temporal information as well right and so what's gonna be my possible image of the X function let's say it's equal 1 what is it do you know so this could be for example the Hamiltonian of the system okay so this was like a bit more mathematical you know introduction or mathematical procedure how do you say you'll make make a more precise definition so that was pretty much everything for today let me turn on the light and let I see you on next Monday thank you for being with me [Music]"},"manual_text":{"0bMe_vCZo30":"OK, so first of all I have a terrible confession to make. This class is actually being run not by me, but by these two guys: Alfredo Canziani and Mark Goldstein, whose names are here [points to slide]. They are the TA'S and you'll talk to them much more often than you'll talk to me. That's the first thing. The other confession I have to make is that if you have questions about this class, don't ask them at the end of this course because I have to run right after the class to catch an airplane. But that can wait until next week. OK, so let's start right in. Some very basic course information. There is a website as you can see. I will do what I can to post the PDF of the slides on the website. Probably just before the lecture, probably just a few minutes before the lecture, usually. But, but it should be there by the time you get to class, or at least by the time I get to class. There's going to be nine lectures that I'm going to teach, on Monday evenings. There is also a practical session every Tuesday night that further on Mark will be running. So, they'll go through some of the, you know, practical questions. Some, you know, refreshers on sort of math, you know mathematics that are necessary for this, and basic concepts. Some tutorials on how to use PyTorch and various other software tools. And there's going to be three guest lectures. The names of the guest lectures are not finalized. But it's gonna be on topics like natural language processing, computer vision, self-supervised learning, things like that. There's going to be a midterm exam, or at least we think there is. And it's going to take one of those sessions, you know, around March. And the evaluation will be done on the midterm and on a final project. And, you can sort of, you know, band in groups of two. Did we say two or three, or just two? We didn't decide yet, we'll see. The project will probably have to do with a combination of self-supervised learning and autonomous driving. We are discussing with various people for data and things like that. Okay, let me talk a little bit about, so this first lecture is really going to be sort of a broad introduction about what deep running is really, and what it can do and what it cannot do. So it will serve as an introduction to the entire thing. So, we'll go through the entire arc, if you want, of the class but in, sort of, very superficial terms so that you get, sort of, broad high-level idea of all the topics we're talking about. And whenever I'll talk about a particular topic you'll see where it fits in this kind of whole picture. But before that... So, there is a prerequisite for the class which is, you know: You need to be kind of familiar with machine learning or at least basic concepts in machine learning. Who here has played with PyTorch, TensorFlow, has trained a neural net? OK. Who has not done that? Don't be shy, OK. OK? So the majority has. Which is good. But I'm not going to assume that you know everything about this. Particularly, I am not going to assume that you know a lot of the, you know, sort of deep underlying techniques. OK, so here is the course plan and depending on what you tell me I can adjust this and sort of, you know, go faster on certain sections that you think are too obvious because you've played with this before, or other things. So intro to Supervised Learning, Neural Nets, Deep Learning. That's what I'm going to talk about today. What deep learning can do, what it cannot do, what are good features. Deep learning is about learning representations. That's what I'm going to talk about. Next week will be about back propagation and basic architectural components. So things like the fact that you build neural nets out of modules that you connect with each other. Then you compute gradients you get automatic differentiations. And then these various types of architectures, loss functions, activation functions \u2014 you know different modules. Tricks like weight sharing and weight tying, multiplicative interactions, attention gating \u2014 things like this, right. And then particular macro architectures, like mixture of experts, Siamese net, hyper networks, etc. So we'll dive pretty quickly in and that's appropriate if you've already played with some of those things. Then there will be either one or two lectures \u2013 I haven't completely decided yet \u2014 about convolutional nets and their applications. One of them might end up being a guest lecture. Then, more specifically, about deep learning architectures that are useful in special cases. So things like recurrent neural nets with back propagation through time, which is the way you train recurrent neural nets. And ... ... and sort of ... ... applications of ... recurrent neural nets to things like control and, you know, producing time series and stuff like that. Then things like combine recurrence and gating and multiplicative interactions like gated recurrent units and LSTM. And then things that really use multiplicative interactions as kind of really a basis of their architecture like memory networks, transformers, adapters, etc., which are sort of very recent architectures that have become extremely popular and in things like NLP and other other areas. And then a little bit about graph neural nets, which I'm not going to talk about this a lot because there is another course that you can take by Joan Bruna where he spends a lot of time on graph neural nets. Then... then we'll talk about how we get those deep learning systems to work. And, so, various tricks to get them to work. Sort of understanding the type of optimization that takes place in neural nets. So... ...the type of... you know, we... we use, of course \u2014 learning is always about, almost always about, optimization. And deep learning is almost always about gradient-based optimization. And there are certain rules about optimization in the convex case that are well understood. But they're not well understood when the training is stochastic, which is the case for most deep learning systems. And they're not very well understood also in deep learning, because the the cost function is not ... is not convex. It has local minima, and saddle points, and things like this. So it's important to understand the geometry of the objective function. I say it's important to understand but the the big secret here is that nobody actually understands. So ... it's important to understand that nobody understands. Okay? But there are a few tricks that have come up through a combination of intuition and a little bit of theoretical analysis and empirical search. Things like initialization tricks, normalization tricks, and regularization tricks like drop out. (Grading clipping is more for optimization.) Things like momentum, average HDD, the various methods for parallelizing HDD. Many of which do not work. And then something a little exotic called target prop and the Lagrangian formulation of back prop. Then I'll switch to my favorite topic, which is energy-based models. So this is sort of a general formulation of a lot of different, sort of, approaches to learning \u2014 whether they are supervised, unsupervised, self-supervised. And whether they involve things like inference. Like, you know, searching for the value of variables that nobody tells you the value of, but that your process your system is supposed to infer. So that could be thought of as sort of a way of implementing reasoning with neural nets. So you could think of reasoning in neural nets as a process by which you have some energy function that's being optimized with respect to some variables. And the value you get as a result of this optimization is the value of those variables you were trying to find. And so, there is sort of the the common view that a neural net is just a function that computes its output as a function of its input. So you just run through the neural net, you get an output. But that's a fairly restrictive form of inference in the sense that you can only produce one output for a given input. But very often there are multiple possible answers to a given input. And so, how do you, kind of, represent problems of this type where there are multiple answers, multiple possible answers, to a given input? And one answer to this is: You make those answers the minima of some energy function, and your inference algorithm is going to find values of those variables that minimize this objective function. And there might be multiple minima. So that means your model might produce multiple outputs for a given input. Okay? So, energy-based models, it's kind of a way of doing this. A special case of those energy-based models are probabilistic models: like, you know Bayesian methods, graphical model, Bayesian nets and things like this. Energy methods are a little more general. So a little less specific. So special cases of this include things like what people used to call structure prediction. And then there is a lot of applications of this in what's called self-supervised learning. And that will be the topic of the next couple lectures. So self-supervised learning is a very very active topic of research today. And probably something that's going to become really dominant in the future. It's already ... ... in the space of a year, it's become dominant in natural language processing. And, in the last few months, just three months there's been a few papers that show that self-supervised learning methods actually work really well in things like computer vision as well. And so my guess, my guess is that ... self-supervised learning is going to take over the world in the next few years. So, I think it's useful to hear about it in this class. The things like \u2014 I'm not going to go through a laundry list of this \u2014 but there are things that you may have heard of: like variational auto-encoders, de-noising auto-encoders, BERT, which is, you know, those transformer architectures that are trained for natural language processing. They are trained with self-supervised learning and they are a special case of a de-noising auto-encoder. So a lot of those things you may have heard of without realizing they were all, kind of \u2014 it can be all understood in the context of this sort of energy-based approach. And that includes also generatative adversarial networks (GANs), which I'm sure many of you have heard of. And then there is self-supervised learning and beyond. So, you know, how do we get machines to really kind of become really intelligent? They're not superintelligent. They're not very intelligent right now. They can solve very narrow problems very well, sometimes with superhuman performance. But no machine has any kind of common sense. And, the most intelligent machines that we have probably have less common sense than a house cat. So, how do we get to cat-level intelligence first, and then maybe human-level intelligence? And, I don't pretend to have the answer, but I have, you know \u2014 a few ideas that are interesting to discuss in the context of self-supervised learning, there. I've had some applications. Any questions? So that's the plan of the course. Okay. it might change, dynamically But, at least, that's the intent. Any questions? ...Okay... [Student Question: Will we also be having assignments in the course?] Yeah, yeah, there are assignments. [...Inaudible...] Okay, so for those of you who didn't hear Alfredo, because he didn't speak very loudly: The final project is actually going to be a competition between the teams. So there is going to be a leaderboard and everything. And, in preparation for this, the assignments will be basically practice to get familiar with all the techniques that you would need for deep learning in general, but for the final project in particular. [Also for the midterm.] Right, also for midterm, obviously. Okay, so most of you probably know that \u2014 and this is gonna probably be boring for some of you who've already played with those things \u2014 but let's start from the basics. Deep learning is inspired by what people have observed about the brain, but the inspiration is just an inspiration. It's not, the attempt is not to copy the brain because there's a lot of details about the brain that are irrelevant, and that we don't know if they are relevant actually to human intelligence. So the inspiration is at kind of the conceptual level. And, it's a little bit the same as, you know, airplanes being inspired by birds. But the underlying principles of flight for birds and airplanes are essentially the same, but the details are extremely different. They both have wings. They both generate lift by propelling themselves through air, but, you know, airplanes don't have feathers and don't flap their wings. So it's a bit of the same idea. And the history of this goes back to a field that has kind of almost disappeared, or, at least changed names now, called Cybernetics. If you want a specialist about the history of cybernetics, he is sitting right there: Joe Lemelin Can you raise your hand? So, Joe is actually philosopher. And he is interested in the \u2014 he actually has a seminar on, kind of, the history of AI. In the what department is this? [Joe: Media, Culture, and Communication.] Media, Culture, and Communication. So, not CS. He knows everything about, you know, the history of cybernetics. So it started in the 40's with two gentlemen: McCulloch and Pitts. Their picture is on the top right here. And they came up with the idea that, you know, people at the time were interested in logic, but neuroscience was a very sort of nascent field. And, they got the idea that if neurons are basically threshold units that are on or off, then by connecting neurons with each other, you can build Boolean circuits and you can basically do logical inference with neurons. So they say, you know: The brain is basically a logical inference machine because the neurons are binary. And this idea \u2014 So the idea was that a neuron computes a weighted sum of its inputs and then compares the weighted sum to a threshold. It turns on if it's above the threshold, turns off if it's below. Which is sort of simplified view of how real neurons work \u2014 a very, very simplified view. That model kind of stuck with the field for decades. Almost four decades. Actually, a full four decades. Then there was, you know, quasi-simultaneously Donald Hebb, who had the idea that neurons in the brain \u2014 it's an old idea that the brain learns by modifying the strength of the connections between the neurons that are called the synapses. And you had the idea of what's now called Hebbian learning, which is that if two neurons fire together, then the connection that links them increases. And if they don't fire together, maybe it decreases. That's not an idea for learning algorithm, but it's sort of a first idea, perhaps. And then cybernetics was proposed by this guy Norbert Wiener, who is here. [Bottom Right] This is the whole idea that by having systems that, kind of, have sensors and have actuators, you can have feedback loops and you can have, you know, self-regulating systems. And, what's the theory behind this? You know, we sort of take that for granted now. But the idea that you know, you have things, like kind of, for example: You know, you drive your car, right? You turn the wheel and there's a so-called PID controller that actually turns the wheel in proportion to how you turn the steering wheel. And it's a feedback mechanism that basically measures the position of the steering wheel, measures the position of the wheel of the car. And, then, if there is a difference between the two, kind of corrects the wheels of the car so that they match the orientation steering wheel. That's a feedback mechanism. That, the stability of this, and the rules about this basically all come initially from this work. That led to a gentleman by the name of Frank Rosenblatt to basically imagine learning algorithms that modified the weights of very simple neural nets. And what you see here at the bottom the two pictures here [Bottom Left]: This is Frank Rosenblatt, and this is the Perceptron. This was a physical analog computer. It was not a three-line Python program, which is what it is now. It was a gigantic machine with, you know, wires and optical sensors so you could show it pictures. It was very low resolution. And then it had \u2014 it had neurons that could compute a weighted sum, and the weights could be adapted. And the weights were potentiometers. The potentiometers had motors on them so they could rotate for the learning algorithm. So it was electro-mechanical. And what he's holding here in his hand is a module of eight weights with (you can count them), with those potentiometers, motorized potentiometers on them. Okay, so that was a little bit of history of where neural nets come from. Another interesting piece of history is that this whole idea of, sort of, trying to build intelligent machines by basically simulating networks of neurons was born in the 40's, kind of took off a little bit in the late-50's, and completely died in the 1960's, in the late-1960s when people realized that with the kind of learning algorithms and architectures that people were proposing at the time you couldn't do much. You know, you could do some basic, very simple pattern recognition, but you couldn't do much. So between 1969, roughly, and \u2014 or 1968 \u2014 and 1984, I would say, basically, nobody in the world was working on neural nets except a few kind of isolated researchers mostly in Japan. Japan is its own, kind of, relatively isolated ecosystem for funding research. People don't listen to the same kind of ... ... fashions, if you want. And then the field took off again in 1985, roughly, with the emergence of backpropagation [backprop]. So backpropagation is an algorithm for training multi-layer neural nets, as many of you know. People were looking for something like this in the 60's and basically didn't find it. And the reason they didn't find it was because they had the wrong neurons. They were using McCulloch-Pitts neurons that are binary. The way to get backpropagation to work is to use an activation function that is continuous, differentiable, or at least, continuous. And people just didn't have ... you know, the idea of using continuous neurons. And so, they didn't think that you could train those systems with gradient descent, because things were not differentiable. Now there's another reason for this, which is that if you have a neural net with binary neurons, you never need to compute multiplications. You never need to multiply two numbers. You only need to add numbers, right. If your neuron is active, you just add the weight to the weighted sum. If it is inactive, you don't do anything. If you have continuous neurons, you need to multiply the activation of a neuron by a weight to get a contribution to the weighted sum. It turns out, before the 1980's, multiplying two numbers, particularly floating point numbers, on any sort of non-ridiculously expensive computer was extremely slow. And so there was an incentive to not use continuous neurons for that reason. So the reason why backprop didn't emerge earlier than the mid 80's is because that's when, you know, computers became fast enough to do floating point multiplications, pretty much. People didn't think of it this way, but that's, you know, kind of retrospectively, that's pretty much what happened. So, there was a wave of interest in neural nets between 1985 and 1995 \u2014 lasted about 10 years. In 1995, it died again. People in machine learning basically abandoned the idea of using neural nets. (For reasons that I'm not gonna go into right now.) And that lasted until the late 2000's, early 2010. So, when around 2009\/2010 people realized that you could use multi-layer neural nets, training with backprop, and get an improvement for speech recognition. It didn't start with ImageNet. It started with speech recognition, around 2010. And within 18 months of the first papers being published on this, every major player in speech recognition had deployed commercial speech recognition systems that use neural nets. So, if you had an Android phone and you were using any other speech recognition features in an Android phone around 2012 that used neural nets. That was probably the first really, really wide deployment of, kind of, modern forms of deep learning, if you want. Then at the end of 2012 \/ early-2013, the same thing happened in computer vision, where the computer vision community realized deep learning, convolutional nets in particular, work much better than whatever it is that they were using before, and started to switch to using commercial nets, and basically abandoned all previous techniques. So that created a second revolution, now in computer vision. And then three years later, around 2016 or so, the same thing happened in natural language processing \u2014 in language translation, and things like this: 2015\/16. And, now we're going to see \u2014 it's not happened yet \u2014 but we're going to see the same revolution occur in things like robotics, and control, and, you know, a whole bunch of application areas. But let me get to this: Okay. So, you all know what supervised learning is, I'm sure. And this is really what the vast majority \u2014 and not the vast majority \u2014 90-some percent applications of deep learning use supervised learning as kind of the main thing. So supervised learning is the process by which you collect a bunch of pairs of inputs and outputs of examples of, let's say, images together with a category (if you want to do image recognition). Or a bunch of audio clips with their text transcription: a bunch of text in one language with the transcription in another language, etc. and you feed one example to the machine. It produces an output. If the output is correct you don't do anything, or you don't do much. If the output is incorrect then you tweak the parameters of the machine. (Think of it as a parametrized function of some kind.) And you tweak the parameters of that function in such a way that the output gets closer to the when you want. Okay. This is in non-technical terms what supervised learning is all about. Show a picture of a car, if the system doesn't say car, tweak the parameters. The parameters in the neural net are going to be the weights, you know, that compute weighted sums in those simulated neurons. tweak the knobs so that the output gets closer to the one you want. The trick in neural nets is: How do you figure out in which direction and by how much to tweak the knobs so that the output gets closer to the one you want? That's what gradient computation and backpropagation is about. But before we get to this, a little bit of history again. So there was a flurry of models, basic models for classification. You know, starting with the Perceptron, there was another competing model called the Adaline, which is on the top right here. They are based on the same kind of basic architectures: compute the weighted sum of inputs compared to a threshold. If it's above the threshold, turn on. if it's below the threshold, turn off. What you see, the Adaline here, the thing that Bernie Widrow is tweaking is actually a physical analog computer again. So it's like the Perceptron, it was much less, you know, much smaller, in many ways. The reason I tell you about this is that the the Perception actually was a two layer neural net, a two layer neural net in which the second layer was trainable with adaptive weights. But the first layer was fixed. In fact, most of the time with most experiments it was, It was determined randomly. You would, like, randomly connect input pixels of an image to neurons that would, you know, be threshold neurons with random weights, essentially. This is what they called the associative layer. And that basically became the basis for the sort of conceptual design of a pattern recognition system for the next four decades. I want to say four decades. Yeah, pretty much. So, that model is one by which you take an input, you run it through a feature extractor that is supposed to extract the relevant characteristics of the input that will be useful for the task. So, you want to recognize a face? Can you detect an eye? How do you detect an eye? Well, there is probably a dark circle somewhere. Things like that, right? You want to recognize a car, you know. Well, they are kind of dark, round things, etc. So, the problem here \u2014 and so, what this feature extractor produces is a vector of features, which are things that may be numbers, or they may be on or off. Okay, so it's just a list of numbers, a vector. And you're going to feed that vector to trainable classifier. In the case of Perceptron or a simple neural net, it's gonna be just the system that computes a weighted sum, compares it to a threshold. The problem is that you have to engineer the feature extractor. So the entire literature of pattern recognition (statistical pattern recognition at least) and a lot of computer vision (at least the part of computer vision that's interested in recognition) was focused on this part: the feature extractor. How do you design a feature extractor for a particular problem? You want to do, I don't know, Hangul character recognition. What are the relevant features for recognizing Hangul? And how can you extract them using all kinds of algorithmic tricks? How do you pre-process the images? You know, how do you normalize their size? You know, things like that. How do you skeletonize them? How do you segment them from their background? So the entire literature was devoted to this [Feature Extractor], very very little was devoted to that [Trainable Classifier]. And what deep learning brought to the table is this idea that instead of having this kind of two-stage process for pattern recognition, where one stage is built by hand, where the representation of the input is the result of, you know, some hand-engineered program, essentially. The idea of deep learning is that you learn the entire task end-to-end. Okay, so basically you build your pattern recognition system, or whatever it is that you want to do with it as a cascade or a sequence of modules. All of those modules have tunable parameters. All of them have some sort of nonlinearity in them. And then you stack them, you stack multiple layers of them, which is why it's called deep learning. So the only reason for the \"deep\" word in deep learning is the fact that there are multiple layers. There is nothing more to that. And then you train the entire thing end-to-end. So the complication here, of course, is the fact that the parameters that are in the first box: How do you know how to tune them so that the output does\u2014 you know, goes closer to the output you want? That's what backpropagation does for you. Okay, why do all those modules have to be nonlinear? It's because, if you have two successive modules, and they're both linear, you can collapse them into a single linear. Right, the product of two linear functions, or the composition of two linear functions is a linear function. Take a vector multiply by a matrix and then multiply it by a second matrix. It's as if you had pre-computed the product of those two matrices, and then multiplied the input vector by that composite matrix. So there's no point having multiple layers if those layers are linear. Okay, there's actually a point, but it's a minor point. So, since they have to be nonlinear, what is the simplest multi-layer architecture you can imagine that has arameters that you can tune \u2014 things like weights in the neural nets \u2014 and is non-linear? And you realize quickly that it has to look something like this: So ... Take an input. An input can be represented as a vector, right. An image is just a list of numbers. Think of it as a vector, ignore the fact that it's an image for now. Piece of audio, whatever it is that your sensors or your data set gives you, is a vector. Multiply this vector by a matrix. The coefficients in this matrix are the tunable parameters. And then take the resulting vector, right \u2014 when you multiply a matrix by a vector, you get a vector. Pass each component of this vector through a nonlinear function. And, if you want to have the simplest possible nonlinear function, use something like what's shown at the top here [ReLU(x) = max(x, 0)], which people in neural nets call the ReLU; people in engineering call this half wave rectification; people in math call this positive part. Whatever you want to call it, okay. So, apply this nonlinear function to every component of the vector that results from multiplying the input vector by the matrix. Okay. Now you get a new vector, which has lots of zeros in it, because whenever the weighted sum was less than zero, the output is zero, if you pass through the ReLU. And then repeat the process: Take that vector, multiply it by a weight matrix; pass the result through point wise non-linearity; take the result, pass it \u2014 multiplied by a matrix \u2014 pass the result through nonlinearities. That's a basic neural net, essentially. Okay now Why is that called a neural net at all? It's because when you take a vector and you multiply a vector by a matrix, to compute each component of the output, you actually compute a weighted sum of the components of the input by a corresponding row in the matrix, right. So this little symbol here \u2014 there's a bunch of components of the vector coming into this layer. And, you take a row of the matrix, compute a weighted sum of those values where the weights are the values in the row of that matrix, and that gives you a weighted sum. And you do this for every row that gives you the result, right. So, the number of units after the multiplication by a matrix is going to be equal to the number of rows of your matrix. And the number of columns of the matrix, of course has to be equal to the size of the input. Okay. So supervised learning \u2014 in slightly more formal terms than the one I showed earlier \u2014 is the idea by which you're going to compare the output that the system produces... So, right, you show an input, you run through the neural net, you get an output. You're going to compare this output with a target output. And you are going to have an objective function, a loss module, that computes a distance, a discrepancy, penalty \u2014 whatever you want to call it. Divergence \u2014 okay, there's various names for it. And then you're going to compute the average of that. So the output of this cost function is a scalar, right. It computes the distance, for example, Euclidean distance between a target vector and the vector that the neural net produces, the deep learning system system produces. And then you can compute the average of this cost function, which is just a scalar You're going to average it over a training set, right. So, a training set is composed of a bunch of pairs of inputs and outputs; compute the average of this over the training set. The function you want to minimize with respect to the parameters of the system (the tunable knobs) is that average. Okay. So, you want to find the value of the parameters that minimizes the average error between the output you want and the output you get, averaged over a training set of samples. So... I'm sure the vast majority of people here, sort of, have at least an intuitive understanding of what gradient descent is. So, basically, the way to minimize this is to compute the gradient, right. It's like you are in a mountain, you're lost in the mountain (and it's a very smooth mountain), but there is fog and it's night, and you want to go to the village in the valley. And so, the best thing you can do is you turn around and you see which way is down, and you take a step down in the direction of steepest descent. Okay. So, this search for the direction that goes down: that's called \"computing a gradient\" or, technically, a negative gradient. Okay, then you take a step down. That's taking a step down in the direction of negative gradient. And if you keep doing this and your steps are small enough \u2014 small enough so that when you take a step, you don't jump to the other side of the mountain \u2014 then eventually you're going to converge to the valley, if the valley is convex. Which means that if there is no, kind of, lake, no mountain lakes in the middle where, you know, there's kind of a minimum and you're going to get stuck in that minimum the valley might be lower, but you don't see it. Okay. So that's why convexity is important as a concept. But here is another concept, which is the concept of stochastic gradient, which I'm sure again a lot of you have heard [of]. I'll come back to that in more detail. The objective function you're computing is an average over many many samples. You can compute the objective function in its gradient over the entire training set by averaging the the value of the entire training set. But it turns out it is more efficient to just take one sample or a small group of samples, computing the error that this sample makes, then computing the gradient of that error with respect to the parameters and taking a step. A small step. Then a new sample comes in \u2014 you're going to get another value for the error and another value for the gradient, which may be in a different direction because it's a different sample. And take a step in that direction. And if you keep doing this, you're gonna go down the the cost surface but in kind of a noisy way \u2014 there's going to be a lot of fluctuations. So what is shown here is an example of this. This is stochastic gradient applied to a very simple problem with two dimensions where you only have two weights. And it looks kind of semi-periodic because the examples are always shown in the same order, which is not what you're supposed to do with stochastic gradient. But as you can see the path is really erratic. Why do people use this? There's various reasons. One reason is that, empirically it converges much, much faster, particularly if you have a very large training set. And the other reason is that you actually get better generalization in the end. So if you measure the performance of the system on a separate set that you \u2014 I assume you all know the concepts of \"training set\" and \"test set\" and \"validation set\" but \u2014 So if you test the performance of the system on a different set, you get generally better generalization if you use stochastic gradient than if you actually use the real, true gradient descent. The problem is... yes [inaudible student question] No. It's worse. So computing the entire gradient of the entire dataset \u2014 It is computationally feasible. I mean you can do it. It's not any more expensive than... ...you know... [inaudible student comment] It'll be less noisy but it will be slower. So let me tell you why: I mean, this is something we're gonna talk about again when we talk about optimization. But let me tell you: I give you a training set with a million training samples. It's actually 100 repetitions of the same training sample with 10,000 samples. Okay. So my actual sample is 10,000 training samples. I replicate it 100 times and I claim that, you know, I scrambled it. I tell you here is my training set with a million training samples. So if you do a full gradient, you're going to compute the same values a hundred times. You're gonna spend a hundred times more work than necessary. Without knowing it. Okay. So this only works because of repetition. But it also works in, kind of, more normal situations in machine learning where you have samples that are, have a lot of redundancy in them, like very many samples are very similar to each other, etc. So if there is any kind of coherence \u2014 if your system is capable of generalization, then that means stochastic gradient is going to be more efficient because if you don't stochastic gradient, you're not going to be able to take advantage of that redundancy. So that's one case where noise is good for you. Okay. Don't pay attention to the formula. Don't get scared because we're going to come back to this in more detail. But, why is backpropagation called backpropagation? Again, this is very informal. It's basically a practical application of Chain Rule. So you can think of a neural net of the type that I showed you earlier as a bunch of modules that are stacked on top of each other. And you can think of this as compositions of functions. And you all know the basic rule of calculus. You know, how do you compute the derivative of a function composed with another function? Well the derivative of, you know, F composed with G is the derivative of F at the point of G of X, multiplied by the derivative of G at the point X. Right. So you get the product of the two derivatives. So this is the same thing except that the functions, instead of being scalar functions, are vector functions. They get vectors as inputs and the previous vectors as outputs. More generally, actually, they take multi-dimensional arrays as input and multi-dimensional arrays as output, but that doesn't matter. Basically, what is the generalization of this chain rule in the case of functional modules that have multiple inputs, multiple outputs that you can view as functions? Right. And, basically, it's the same rule if you, kind of, blindly apply them \u2014 it's the same rule as you applied for, as you apply for regular derivatives. (Except here you have to use partial derivatives.) You know, what you see in the end is that if you want to compute the derivative of the difference between the output you want and the output you get, which is the value of your objective function, with respect to any variable inside of the network, then you have to kind of back, you know, propagate derivatives backwards and kind of multiply things on the way. All right. We'll be much more formal about this next week. For now, you just know why it's called backpropagation: because it applies to multiple layers. OK, so the the picture I showed earlier of this neural net is nice, but what if the input is actually an image? Right. So, an image, even sort of a relatively low resolution image, is typically like, you know, a few hundred pixels on the side. OK. So let's say 256 x 256, to take a random example. OK, a car image: 256 x 256. So it's got 65,536 pixels, times three, because you have R, G, and B components to it for, you know, you have three value for each pixels. And so that's, you know, roughly two hundred thousand values. OK, so your vector here is a vector with two hundred thousand components. If you have a matrix that is going to multiply this vector, this matrix is going to have to have two hundred thousand rows \u2014 Columns, I'm sorry. And depending on how many units you have here in the first layer, there's going to be a 200,000 x, you know, maybe a large number. That's a huge matrix. Right. Even if it's 200,000 x 100,000. So you have a compression in the first layer you know, that's already a lot of\u2014very, very large matrix: billions. So it's not really practical to think of this as a full matrix. What you're going to have to do if you want to deal with things like images is make some hypothesis about the structure of this matrix so that it's not a completely full matrix that, you know, connects everything to everything. That would be impractical. At least for a lot of practical applications. So this is where inspiration from the brain comes back. There was some work, classic work, in neuroscience in the 1960s by the gentlemen at the top here: Hubel and Wiesel. They actually won a Nobel Prize for this in the in the 70s but their workforce from the late 50s\u2014early 60s. And what they did was that they poked electrode in the visual cortex of various animals: you know, cats, monkeys, mice, you know, whatever. (I think they like cats a lot.) And they tried to figure out what the neurons in the visual cortex were doing. And what they discovered was that\u2014 so, first of all, well, this is a human brain. But, I mean, this chart is from much later. But all mammalian visual systems is organized in similar way. You have signals coming in to your eyes, striking your retina. You have a few layers of neurons in your retina in front of your photoreceptors that, kind of, pre-process the signal, if you want. They kind of compress it, because you can't have\u2014 you know the human eye is something like a hundred million pixels. So it's like a hundred million pixel camera, megapixel camera. But the problem is you cannot have a hundred million fibers coming out of your eyes, because otherwise your optical nerve would be this big. And you wouldn't be able to move your eyes. So those neurons in front of your retina do compression. They don't do JPEG compression, but they do compression. So that the signal can be compressed to one million fibers. Right. You have one million fibers coming out of each of your eyes. And that makes your, you know, optical nerve about this big, which means, you know, you can carry the signal and turn your eyes. This is actually a mistake that evolution made for vertebrates. Invertebrates are not like that. Invertebrates have actually\u2014so, it's a big mistake because the wires collecting the information from your retina, because the neurons that process the signal in front of your retina, the wires have to kind of\u2014 it'll be in front of your retina, and so blocking part of the view, if you want. And then they have to punch a hole through your retina to get through your brain. So there's a blind spot in your visual field because that's where your optical nerve punches through your retina. So it's kind of ridiculous if you have a camera like this to have the wires coming out the front and then, you know, dig a hole in your sensor to get the wires back. It's much better if the wires come out the back, right? And vertebrates got that wrong. Invertebrates got it right. So, you know, like squid and octopus actually have wires coming out the back. They're much luckier. But anyway. So, the signal goes from your eyes to a little piece of brain called the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is under your brain actually\u2014and like at the basis of it. It does a little bit of contrast normalization. We'll talk about this again in a few lectures. And, and, then that goes to the back of your brain where the the primary visual cortex area called v1 is. It's called V1 in humans. And there's something called the ventral hierarchy: V1, V2, V4 (IT), which is a bunch of brain areas going from the back to the side. And in the infero-temporal cortex right here, this is where object categories are represented. So, when you go around and you see your grandmother, you have a bunch of neurons firing that represent your grandmother in this area. And it doesn't matter what your grandmother is wearing, you know, what what position she is in, if there is occlusion or whatever\u2014those neurons will fire if you see your grandmother. So the sort of category-level things. And those things have been discovered by experiments with patients that had to have their skull open for a few weeks, and where, you know, people poked electrode and had them watch movies and realize this is known that turns on if Jennifer Aniston is on the movie. And it only turns on for Jennifer Aniston. So with the idea that somehow the visual context, you know, can do pattern recognition and seems to have this sort of hierarchical structure, multi-layer structure, there's also the idea that the visual process is essentially a feed-forward process. So the process by which you recognize an everyday object is very fast. It takes about 100 milliseconds. There's barely enough time for the signal to go from your retina to the infero-temporal cortex. It takes about, it's a few millisecond delay per neuron that you have to go through. 100 milliseconds you barely have time to, for just you know, a few spikes to go through the entire system. So there's no time for like, you know, recurrent connections and like, you know, etc. Doesn't mean that there are no recurrent connections. There's tons of them but somehow fast recognition is done without them. So this is called the the feed-forward ventral pathway. And this gentleman here, Kunihiko Fukushima, had the idea of taking inspiration from Hubel and Wiesel in the 70s, and sort of built a neural net model on the computer that had this idea that, first there were layers, But also the idea that Hubel and Wiesel discovered, that individual neurons only react to a small part of the visual field. So they poked electrodes in neurons in V1 and they realized that this neuron in V1 only reacts to motifs that appear in a very small area in the visual field. And then the neuron next to it will react to another area that's next to the first one, right. So the neurons seem to be organized in what's called a retinotopic way, which means that neighboring neurons react to neighboring regions in the visual field. What they also realized is that the group of neurons that all react to the same area in the visual field, and they seem to turn on for edges at a particular orientation. So one neuron will turn on for, if it's receptive field has an edge, a vertical edge, and then the one next to it if the edge is a little slanted, and then the one next to it if the edge is a little rotated, etc. And so they had this picture of V1 basically as oriented, orientation selectivity, so neurons that look at a local field and then react to orientations. And those groups of neurons that react to multiple orientations are replicated over the entire visual field. So this guy Fukushima said, well, why don't I build a neural net that that does this? I'm not going to, you know, necessarily insist that my system extracts oriented features, but I'm going to use some sort of unsupervised learning algorithm to to train it. So he was not training his system end-to-end. He was training it layer by layer in some sort of unsupervised fashion, which I'm not going to go into the details of. And then he used another concept from, so he used the concept that those neurons were replicated across the visual field, and then he used another concept from Hubel and Wiesel called complex cells. So complex cells are units that pool the activities of a bunch of simple cells, which are those oriented orientation-selective units. And they pull them in such a way that if an orientation, if an oriented edge is moved a little bit it will activate different simple cells, but the complex cell, since it integrates the outputs from all those simple cells, will stay activated until the edge moves beyond its receptive field. So those complex cells build a little bit of shift invariance in the representation. You can shift an edge a little bit, and it will not change the activation the activity of one of those complex cells. So that's what we now call \"convolution\" and \"pooling\" in the context of convolutional nets. And that basically is what led me in the mid-80s or late-80s to come up with convolutional nets. So they are basically networks where the connections are local; they are replicated across the visual field; and you intersperse, sort of, feature detection layers that detect those local features with pooling operation. We'll talk about this at length in three weeks. So I'm not going to go to into every detail. But it has, it recycles this idea from Hubel and Wiesel and Fukushima that (...if I can can get my pointer...) that, basically, every neuron in one layer computes a weighted sum of a small area of the input, and the weighted sum uses those weights. But those weights are replicated across, so every neuron in a layer uses the same set of weights. OK, so this is the idea of weight tying or weight sharing. So using backprop we were able to train neural nets like this to recognize handwritten digits. This is back from the late-80s early-90s. And this is me when I was about your age, maybe a little older. I'm about thirty in this video. And this is my phone number when I was working at Bell Labs. Doesn't work anymore. It's a New Jersey number. And I hit a key, and there is this neural net running on the 386 PC with a special accelerator card recognizing those characters, running a neural net very similar to the one I just showed you the animation of. And the thing could, you know, recognize characters of any style, including very strange styles, including even stranger styles. And so this was kind of new at the time because this was back when character recognition, or pattern recognition in general, were still on the model of: we extract features and then we train a classifier on top. And this could basically train the entire, like, learn the entire task from end-to-end. You know, basically, the first few layers of that neural net would would play the role of a feature extractor, but it was trained from data. The reason why we used character recognition is because this was this was the only thing for which we had data. The only task for which there was enough data was either character recognition of speech recognition. Speech recognition experiments were somewhat successful, but not as much. Pretty quickly, we realized we could use those convolutional nets not just to recognize individual characters, but to recognize groups of characters, so multiple characters at a single time. And it's because of this convolutional nature of the network, which I'll come back to in three lectures, that basically allowed those systems to just, you know, be applied to a large image and then they will just turn on whenever they see in their field of view, whenever they see a shape that they can recognize. So, basically, if you have a large image, you train a convolutional net that it has a small input window, and you swipe it over the entire image, and whenever it turns on it means it's detected the object that you trained it to detect. So here the system, you know, is capable of doing simultaneous segmentation and recognition. You know, back in the\u2014before that people in pattern recognition would have an explicit program that would separate individual objects from their background and from each other, and then send each individual object, character for example, to a recognizer. But with this you could, you can do both at the same time. You don't have to worry about it. You don't have to build any special program for it. So in particular this could be applied to natural images for things like facial detection, pedestrian detection, things like this. Right. Same thing, train a convolutional net to distinguish between an image where you have a face and an image where you don't have a face, train this with several thousand examples, and then take that window, swipe it over an image: whenever it turns on there is a face. Of course, the face could be bigger than the window so you sub-sample the image: you make it smaller, and you swipe your network again, and then make it smaller again, swipe your network again. So now you can detect faces regardless of size. OK. In particular you can use this to drive robots. So this is things that were done before deep running became popular, OK. So this is an example where the the network here is a convolutional net. It's applied to the image coming from a camera, from a you know, running robot. And it's trying to classify every window of a small window\u2014like, 40 x 40 pixels or so, even less\u2014 as to whether the central pixel in that window is on the ground or is an obstacle, right. So whatever it classifies as being on the ground is green Whatever it classifies as being an obstacle is red or purple, if it's on a foot of the obstacle. And then you can sort of map this to a map, which you see at the top. And then do planning in this map to reach a particular goal, and then use this to navigate. And so these are two former PhD students. Raia Hadsell on the right, Pierre Sermanet on the Left, who are annoying this poor robot. Pretty confident the robot is not going to break their legs, since they actually wrote the code and trained it. Pierre Sermanet is a research scientist at Google Brain in California working on robotics. Raia Hadsell is head of robotics research\u2014 Director of Robotics research at DeepMind. They did pretty well. So a similar idea can be used for what's called semantic segmentation. So semantic segmentation is the idea that you can, again, with this kind of sliding window approach, you can train a convolutional net to classify the central pixel using a window as a context. But here it's not just trained to classify obstacles from non-obstacles. It's trained to classify something like 30 categories. This is\u2014 this is down Washington Place, I think. This is Washington Square Park. And, it you know, it knows about roads, and people, and plants, and trees, and whatever\u2014but it finds, you know, desert in the middle of Washington Square Park, which is not... There's no beach that I'm aware of... So it's not perfect. At the time it was state of the art, though. That was the best system there was to do this kind of semantic segmentation. I was running around giving talks like trying to evangelize people about deep learning back then. This was around 2010. So this is before the, kind of, deep learning revolution, if you want. And one person, a professor from Israel was sitting in one of my talks. And he's a theoretician, but he was really kind of transfixed by the potential applications of this, and he was just about to take a sabbatical and work for a company called Mobileye, which was a start-up in Israel at the time\u2014 working on autonomous driving. And so, a couple of months after he heard my talk, he started working at Mobileye. He told the Mobileye people, you know\u2014\"You should try this convolutional net stuff. This works really well.\" And the engineers there said\u2014Nah. No, we don't believe in that stuff. We have our own method. So he implemented it, and tried it himself, beat the hell out of all the benchmarks they had. And all of a sudden the whole company switched to using convolutional nets. And they were the first company to actually come up with a vision system for cars that, you know, can keep a car in a highway, and can break if there is a pedestrian or cyclist crossing. I'll come back to this in a minute. They were basically using this technique. Semantic segmentation, very similar to the one I showed for the robot before. This was a guy by the name of Shai Shalev-Schwartz. You have to be aware of the fact also that back in the 80s, people were really interested in using, in sort of implementing special types of hardware that could run neural nets really fast. And these are kind of a few examples of neural net chips that were actually implemented\u2014I had to do with some of them\u2014 but they were implemented by people working in the same group as I was, as I was at Bell Labs in New Jersey. So this was kind of a hot topic in the 1980s, and then of course with the interest in neural nets dying in the mid-90s people weren't working on this anymore, until a few years ago. Now the hottest topic in in chip design in the chip industry is neural net accelerators. You go to any conference on computer architecture you know, chip, like ISSCC, which is the big kind of solid-state circuit conference\u2014half the talks are about neural net accelerators. And I worked on a few of those things. OK, so then something happened, as I told you, around 2010, -13, -15 in speech recognition, image recognition, natural language processing, and it's continuing. We're in the middle of it now for other topics. And what happened, and I'm really sad to say it didn't happen in my lab, but but with our friends, we started, with Yoshua Bengio and Geoff Hinton back in the early 2000s\u2014we knew, you know that deep learning was working really well and we knew that the whole community was making a mistake by dismissing neural nets and deep learning. And so\u2014 we didn't use the term deep learning yet. We invented it a few years later\u2014so, around 2003 or so, 2004, we started kind of a conspiracy, if you want. We got together and we said we're just going to try to, kind of, beat some records, and some data sets, invent some new algorithms that will allow us to train very large neural nets. So that will, and will collect very large data sets, so that we will show the world that those things really work, because nobody really believed it. That really kind of succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. In particular, in 2012 Geoff Hinton had one student Alex Krizhevsky, who spent a lot of time implementing convolutional nets on GPUs, which were kind of new at the time\u2014they were not entirely new but they were starting to become really high-performance. So he was very good at sort of hacking that and and then they were able to train much larger neural nets, convolutional nets, than anybody was able to do before. And so they used it to to train on the ImageNet dataset. The ImageNet dataset is a bunch of natural photos. And the system is supposed to recognize the main objects in the photo among 1,000 different categories. And the training set had 1.3 million samples. Which is kinda large. So what they did was build this really large, and very deep convolutional net, pretty much on the same model as what we had before, implemented on GPUs, and let it run for a couple weeks. And with that they beat the performance of best competing systems by a large margin. So this is the error rate on ImageNet going back to 2010. So 2010 it was about 28% error, top 5. So, basically you get an error if the correct category is not in the top 5 among 1,000. OK, so it's kind of a mild measure of error. 2011 it was 25.8%, the system that was able to do this was actually very, very large. It was sort of somewhat convolutional-net-like, but it wasn't trained. I mean only the last layer was trained. And then Geoff and his team got it down to 16.4%, and then that was a watershed moment for the computer vision community. A lot of people said, Okay, you know now we know that this thing works. And the whole community went from basically refusing every paper that had neural nets in them in 2011 and 2012 to refusing every paper that does not have a convolutional net in it in 2016. So now it's the new religion, right. You can't get a paper in a computer vision conference unless you use ConvNets somehow. And the error rate went down really quickly, you know people found all kinds of really cute architectural tricks that, sort of, made those things work better. And what you'd see in there is that there was an inflation of the number of layers. So my convolutional nets from the 90s had 7 layers or so, and from the early 2000s. And then AlexNet had, I don't know, 12. Then VGG the year afterward, after that had 19. GoogLeNet had I don't know how many, because it's hard to figure out how you count. And then the workhorse now of object recognition, the standard backbone, as people called them, has 50 layers. It's called ResNet-50. But some, you know, some networks have 100 layers or so. So Alfredo a few years ago put together this chart that shows where each of those blob is a particular network architecture.  And the x-axis is the number of billions of operations you need to do to compute the output. Okay, those things are really big billions of connections. The y-axis is the top one accuracy on ImageNet. So it's not the same measure of performance as the one I showed you before. So the best systems are around 84, today. And the size of the of the blob is the memory occupancy, so the number of millions of floats that you need to store to store the weight, the weight values. Now people are very smart about compressing those things like you know quantizing them, and there's entire teams at Google, Facebook, and various other places that only work on optimizing those networks and compressing the things so they can run fast. Because, to give you just a rough idea, the number of times Facebook, for example, runs a convolutional net on its servers per day is in the tens of billions. Okay. So there's a huge incentive to optimizing the amount of computation necessary for this. So one... one reason why convolutional nets are being so successful is that they exploit a property of natural data, which is compositionality. So compositionality is the property by which a scene is composed of objects; objects are composed of parts; parts are composed of sub-parts; sub-parts are really combinations of motifs; and motifs are combinations of contours or edges, right, or textures. And those are just combinations of pixels. Okay, so there's this so-called compositional hierarchy that, you know, particular combinations of objects at one layer in the hierarchy form objects at the next layer. And so if you, kind of, mimic this compositional  hierarchy in the architecture of the network, and you let it learn the appropriate combinations of features at one layer that, you know, form the the features of the next layer, that's really what deep learning is. Okay. Learning to represent the world and exploit the structure of the world\u2014and the world, being the fact that there is organization in the world because the world is compositional. A statistician by the name of Stuart Geman, who is at Brown University, said\u2014 so he was kind of playing on the famous Einstein quote, Einstein said: The most incomprehensible thing about the world is that the world is comprehensible. Like, among all the complicated things that the world, you know, the world could be extremely complicated, so complicated that we have no way of understanding it. And it looks like a conspiracy that we are able to understand at least part of the world. And so Stuart Geman's version of this is that the world is compositional... or there is a God. (Because you need supernatural things to be able to understand it if the world is not compositional.) So this has led to incredible progress in things like computer vision, as you know, from you know, being able to unreliably identify, you know, detect people, to being able to generate masks for every object, accurate masks, and then even to figure out the pose, and then do this in real time on a mobile platform, you know. I mean the progress has been sort of nothing short of incredible, and most of those things are based on two basic families of architectures. This sort of so-called one-pass object detection\/recognition architectures called RetinaNet, feature pyramid network. There's various names for it. Or U-Net. Then another type called Mark-RCNN, both of them actually originated from Facebook. Or, the people who originated them are now at Facebook\u2014they sometimes came up with it before they came to Facebook. But, you know, those things work really well, you know, they can do things like that: detect objects that are partially occluded, and, you know, draw a mask of every object. So basically, this is a neural net, a convolutional net where the input is an image. But the output is also an image. In fact, the output is a whole bunch of images, one per category. And for each category outputs the mask of the object from that category. Those things can also do what's called \"instant segmentation.\" So if you have a whole bunch of sheeps, it can tell you, you know, not just that this region is sheep, but actually pick out the individual sheeps and will tell them apart, and it will count the sheeps right, and fall asleep. That's what you're supposed to do right, to fall asleep you count sheeps, right? And the cool thing about deep learning is that a lot of the community has embraced the whole concept that research has to be done in the open. So a lot of the stuff that we're gonna be talking about, as you probably know, in the class is it's not just published, but it's you know, published with code. It's not just code, it's actually pre-trained models that you can just download and run. All open source. All free to use. So that's really new. I mean people didn't use to do research this way, particularly in industry. But even in academia people weren't used to kind of distributing their code. But deep learning has sort of, somehow the race has kind of driven people to kind of be more open about research. So there's a lot of applications of all this, as I said, you know self-driving cars. This is actually a video from Mobileye, and Mobileye was pretty early in this in using convolutional nets for autonomous driving. To the point that in 2015 they had managed to shoehorn a convolutional net on the chip that they had designed for some other purpose. And they sold the licensed the technology to Tesla. So the first self-driving Tesla's, I mean self-driving, not really self-driving, they have driving assistance, right. They can keep in lane on the highway and change lane\u2014had this Mobileye system. And, and that's, that's pretty cool. So that's a convolutional net. It's a little chip that is, you know, just behind the, it looks out the window and it's behind the the rear-view mirror. Since then this\u2014you know, four\/five years ago\u2014since then this kind of technology has been very widely deployed by a lot of different companies. Mobileye still now was bought by Intel, and they have like 70 or 80 percent of the market for those vision systems. But, but there is a lot of companies that\u2014and car manufacturers\u2014 that use those things. So in fact in some European countries, every single car that comes out, even low-end cars, has convolutional-net-based vision systems. And they call this: emergency, emergency, sort of, advanced emergency braking system or automated emergency braking system.  AEBS\u2014 is deployed in every car in France, for example. It reduces collisions by 40%. So not every car on the roads have them yet, because you know people keep their cars for a long time. But what that means is that it saves lives. So a very positive application of deep learning. Another big category of applications, of course, is medical imaging. So this is a, it's probably the hottest topic in radiology these days\u2014is how to use AI (which means convolutional nets) for radiology. This [slide image] is lifted from a paper by some of our colleagues here at NYU, where they analyzed MRI images. So there's one big advantage to convolutional nets: it's that they don't need to look at the screen to look at an MRI. In particular to be able to look at an MRI, they don't have to slice it into 2D images. They can look at the entire 3D volume. This is one property that this thing uses. It's a 3D convolutional net that looks at the entire volume of an MRI image and then produces, you know, it uses the very similar technique for, as I was showing before, for semantic segmentation. And it produces, it basically turns on on the output image wherever there is some, you know, here a femur bone, but you know, it could be\u2014 so this is the kind of result it produces. It works better in 3D than in 2D slices. Or, it can turn on when it detects malignant tumor in mammograms. (This is to 2D, it's not 3D.) And there's, you know, various other projects in medical imaging that are going around. Okay. Lots of applications in science and physics, bioinformatics, you know, whatever, which we'll come back to so... Okay. So there's a bunch mysteries in deep learning. They're not complete mysteries, because people have some understanding of all this, but they are mysteries in the sense that we don't have, like, a nice theory for everything. Why do they work so well? So one big question that theoreticians were asking many years ago, when I was trying to convince the world that deep longing was a good idea, was that they would tell me: Well, you can approximate any function with just two layers, why do you need more? And I'll come back to this in a minute. What's so special about convolutional nets? I talked about the compositionality of natural images, or natural data, in general. This is true for speech also and values of the signals, natural signals. But it seems a little contrived. How is it that we can train the system, despite the fact that the objective function we're minimizing is very non-convex. We may have lots of local minima. This was a big criticism that people were throwing at neural nets, people who'd never played with neural nets were throwing out neural nets back in the old days. Say, like you know, you have no guarantee that your algorithm will converge\u2014you know, it's too scary. I'm not gonna use it. And, the last one is: why is it that the way we train neural nets breaks everything that every textbook in statistics tell you? Every textbook in statistics tells you, if you have n data points, you shouldn't have more than n parameters, because you're going to overfit like crazy. You know, you might regularize.  If you're a Bayesian, you might through a prior. But... (which is equivalent) But what guarantee do you have? And with neural nets, neural nets are wildly over parametrized. We train neural nets with hundreds of millions of parameters, routinely. They're used in production. And the number of training samples is nowhere near that. How does that work? But it works! OK, so things we can do with deep learning today: You know, we can have safer cars; we can have better medical analysis, medical image analysis systems; we can have pretty good language translation, far from perfect, but useful; stupid chatbots; you know, very good information search retrieval and filtering. Google and Facebook nowadays are completely built around deep learning. You take deep learning out of them and they crumble. And, you know, lots of applications in energy management and production, and all kinds of stuff; manufacturing, environmental protection. But we don't have really intelligent machines. We don't have machines with common sense. We don't have intelligent personal assistants. We don't have, you know, smart chatbots. We don't have household robots. You know, I mean, there's a lot of things we don't know how to do, right. Which is why we still do research. OK, so, deep learning is really about learning representations. But really we should know in advance what representations are. So I talked about the traditional model of pattern recognition. But... Representation is really about you know, you have your raw data, and you want to turn it into a form that is useful, somehow. Ideally, you'd like to turn it into a form that's useful regardless of what you want to do with it. Sort of \"useful\" in a general way. OK, and it's not entirely clear what that means. But, at least, you want to turn it into a representation that's useful for the task that you are envisioning. And there's been a lot of ideas over the decades on, sort of, general ways to pre-process natural data in such a way that you produce good representations of it. I'm not going to go through the details of this laundry list. But the things like tallying the space, doing random projection. So random projection is actually, kind of, you know, like a monster that rears its head periodically, like every five years. And you have to whack it on the head every time he pops up. That was the idea behind the Perceptron. So the first layer of a perceptron is a layer of random projections. What does that mean? A random projection is a random matrix, which you know, has a smaller output dimension than input dimension, with some sort of non-linearity at the end, right. So think about a single layer neural net with nonlinearities, but the weights are random. So you can think of this as random projections. And a lot of people are rediscovering that wheel periodically, claiming that it's great because you don't have to do multi-layer training. And so it started with the Perceptron, and then you know it came back in the 60s, and then it came back again in the 1980s, and then it came back again. And now it came back. There's a whole community, mostly in Asia. They call two layer neural nets, where the first layer is random, they call this \"extreme learning machines,\" OK. It's like, it's ridiculous, but it exists. They're not \"extreme,\" I mean they're extremely stupid, but\u2014you know. Right, so I was mentioning the compositionality of the world. It's, you know, from pixels to edges to texton, motifs, parts, objects. In text you have characters, word, word groups, clauses, sentences, stories. In speech it's the same, you have individual samples. You have, you know, spectral band, sound, phone, phonemes, words, etc. You always have this kind of hierarchy. OK, so here are many attempts at dismissing the whole idea of deep learning. OK, first, first thing. And this is things that I've heard for decades, OK\u2014 from mostly theoreticians, but a lot of people, and you have to know about them because they're going to come back in five years when people say, \"Oh, deep learning sucks.\" Why not use support-vector machines? OK, so, here is support-vector machines here on the top left. Support-vector machine is a, and I'm sure many of you have heard about kernel machines and support-vector machines. Who knows what this is? I mean, even if it's a rough idea what this is. OK, a few hands. Who has no idea what a support-vector machine is? Don't be shy. Yeah. Yeah, I mean it's okay if you don't. OK, like most people haven't raised their hands for either.  [Alfredo: Hands up, please, who knows support-vector machines.]  OK, come on all the way up. Cool, all right. Who has no idea what it is? Don't be shy, it's okay. [Alfredo: inaudible] All right, good. Right, so here's the support-vector machine. Support-vector machine is a two layer neural net. It's not really a neural net, people don't like when it's formulated this way, but really you can think of it this way. It's a two layer neural net, where the first layer, which is symbolized by this function K here, each unit in the first layer compares the input vector X to one of the training samples X^i's.  OK, so you take your training samples, let's say you have a thousand of them\u2014 so you have a thousand X^i's, from i = 1 to 1,000, and you have some function K that is going to compare X and X^i.  Good example of a function to compare the two is you take the dot product between X and X^i, and you pass the result through, like, exponential minus square or something. So you get a Gaussian response, as a function of the distance between X and X^i, OK. So it's a way of comparing to two vectors, doesn't matter what it is. And, then you take those scores coming out of this K function that compares the input to every sample and you compute a weighted sum of them. And what you're going to learn are the weights, the alphas. Okay, so it's a two-layer neural net in which the second layer is trainable and the first layer is fixed. But in a way you can think of the first layer as being trained in an unsupervised manner, because it uses the data from the training set, but it only uses the X's, doesn't use the Y's. It uses the data in the stupidest way you can imagine, which is you store every X and use every single X as the weight of a neuron, if you want. Okay. That's what support vector machine is. You can write a thousand page book about the cute mathematics behind that. But the bottom line is it's a two-layer neural net where the first layer is trainied a very stupid way unsupervised, and the second layer is just a linear classifier. So, it's basically glorified template matching, because it basically compares the input vector to all the all the training samples.  And so, it doesn't work if you want to do like, you know, computer vision with raw images. If X is an image and the X^i's are a million images from ImageNet\u2014 first of all, for every image you're gonna have to compare it with a million images, or maybe a little less if you're smart, and how you train it. That's going to be very expensive, and the kind of comparison you're making is basically what solves the problem. The weighted sum you're gonna get at the end is really the cherry on the cake. I use that analogy too often, actually. So... You can approximate, you can have theorems that show that you can approximate any function you want, as close as you want, by tuning the K function and the alphas.  And so, if you were to talk to a theoretician, they'll tell you: Why do you need deep learning? I can approximate any function I want with a kernel machine. The number of terms in that sum can be very large, and nobody tells you what kernel function you can use. And so, that doesn't solve the problem. You can use a two-layer neural net, OK. So this is the top right here. The first layer is a nonlinear function F applied to the product of a matrix W^0 by input vector; and then the second layer multiplied by the second matrix; and then passes it through another non-linearity. OK, so this is a composition of two linear and non-linear operations. Again, you can show that under some conditions you can approximate any function you want with something like this. Given that you have a large enough vector in the middle. OK, so the dimension of what comes out of the first layer, if it's high enough \u2014potentially infinite\u2014you can approximate any function you want as close as you want, by making this layer go to infinity. So again, you talk to theoreticians and they tell you: Why do you need layers? I can approximate anything I want with two layers. But there is an argument, which is it could be very, very expensive to do it in two layers. And... For some of you this may sound familiar. For most of you probably not. Let's say I want to design a logic circuit. OK, so, when you design logic circuits, right, you have AND-gates and OR-gates and... or NAND-gates, right. You can do everything with just NAND's, right, negative ANDs.  And if you.. You can show that any Boolean function can be written as a bunch of ORs on a bunch of, a bunch... you know, a bunch of ANDs and then an OR on top of this. That's called disjointed normal form (DNF). So any function can be written in two layers. The problem is that for most functions, the number of terms you need in the middle is exponential in the size of the input. So, for example, if I give you N bits, and ask you to construct a circuit that tells me if the number of bits that are on in the input string is even or odd. OK, it's a simple Boolean function: 1 or 0 on the output. The number of gates that you need is essentially exponential, in the middle. If you do it in two layers. If you allow yourself to do it in log(N) layers, where N is number of input bits, then it's linear. OK. So you go from exponential complexity to linear complexity if you allow yourself to use multiple layers. It's as if, you know, when you write a program\u2014 I'll tell you write the program in such a way that there is only two sequential steps that are necessary to run your program. So basically your program has two sequential instructions. You can have, you can run as many instructions as you want in your program but they have to run in parallel, most of them. And you're only allowed two sequential steps. OK. And, the kind of instructions you have access to are things like, you know, linear combinations, nonlinearities\u2014 like simple things, right. Not like entire sub-programs. So for most, most problems, the number of intermediate values you're going to have to compute in the first step is going to be exponential in the size of the input. There's only a tiny number of problems for which you're going to be able to get away with a non-exponential number of minterms. But if you allow your program to run multiple steps sequentially then all of a sudden, you know, it can be much simpler. It will run slower, but it will take a lot less memory. It will take a lot less stuff\u2014 resources. So people who design computers circuits know this, right. You can design, for example, a circuit that adds two binary numbers. And there is a very simple way to do this, which is that you first you take the first two bits, you add them, and then you propagate the carry at the second bit, the second pair of bits, you know, taking the carry into account that gives you the second bit of result, and then carry, you know, propagate the carry, and then you do this sequentially, right. So problem with this is that it takes the time that's proportional to the size of the numbers that you're trying to add. So circuit designers have a way of, basically, pre-computing the carry, it's called carry lookahead, so that the number of steps necessary to do an addition is actually not N, it's much less than that. OK. But that, that's at the expense of a huge increase in the complexity of the circuit. The the number, like the area that it takes on the chip. So this exchange between time and space, or, between depth and and... and, kind of, time is is known. So what do we call deep models? So, you know, a two-layer neural net, one that has one hidden layer, I don't call that \"deep,\" even though technically it uses backprop. But, eh, you know, it doesn't really learn complex representations. So there's this idea of hierarchy in deep learning. SVMs definitely aren't deep. Unless you learn complicated kernels, but then they're not SVM's anymore. So what are good features? What are good representations? So, here's an example I like. There is something called the manifold hypothesis, and it's the fact that natural data\u2014 So, if I take a picture of this room with, you know, a camera with a 1,000 x 1,000 pixel resolution. That's 1 million pixels at 3 million values. It leaves, you can think of it as a vector with 3 million components. Among all the possible vectors with 3 million components, how many of them correspond to what we would call natural images? We can tell when we see a picture whether it's a natural image or not. We have a model in our visual system that tells us this looks like a real, like a real image. And we can tell when it's not. So the number of combinations of pixels that actually are things that we  think of as natural images is a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny subset of the set of all possible images. There's way more ways of combining random pixels in nonsensical images than there are ways of combining pixels into things that look like natural images. So the manifold hypothesis is that the set of things that, you know, look natural to us live in a low-dimensional surface inside the high-dimensional ambient space. And a good example to convince yourself of this: Imagine I take lots of pictures of a person making faces, right. So the person is in front of a white background. Her hair not moving. And she, kind of, moves her head around and, you know, makes faces, etc. The set of all images of that person\u2014so I take a long video of that person\u2014the set of all images of that person  lives in a low dimensional surface. So a question I have for you is, What's the dimension of that surface? Whatever magnitude, okay. Any, yes? [Inaudible student comment.] Yeah, you've probably heard my spiel before, but... [Speaker: What did the person say?] Huh? [Speaker: What did they say?] OK, so for whoever hasn't heard this, you have a shot, another shot at an answer. OK, any guess? No? Don't be shy. I want like multiple proposals. Anyone. You can look down your laptop, but, you know, I can point at you or something. OK, any idea? Yes. No idea? It's OK. You, any idea?  Maybe you heard what he said. [Inaudible student comment.] Linear, what does that mean? [Inaudible student comment.] It's a 1D space. OK, a one-dimensional subspace. OK, any other proposal? Any idea? OK, the images I'm taking are a million pixels. OK, so the ambient space is 3 million dimensions. [Inaudible student comment] They don't change, no. And the person can move the head, you know, turn around, things like this. But not really move the whole body. I mean you only see the face, it's mostly centered. [Student: A thousand.] A thousand, OK. Why? [Inaudible student comment.] OK yeah, that's a good guess. At least the motivation. [Inaudible student comment.] Say again. [Student: The surface area of the person.]  The surface area of the person. Right. So it's bounded by the number of pixels occupied by the person. That's for sure. That's a, that's an upper bound. Yes. Those pixels, of course, are not gonna take all possible values. So that's a wide upper ground. Any other idea? OK. So, basically the dimension of that, as you said, Is bounded by the number of muscles in the face of the person. Right. The number of degrees of freedom that you observe in that person is the number of muscles in their face. The number of independently movable muscles, right. So there's 3 degrees of freedom due to the fact that you can tilt your head this way, that way, or that way. That's 3, right there. Then there is translation, this way, that way. Maybe this way and that way, maybe up or down. That's 6. And then the number of muscles in your face, right. So you can smile. You can, you know, pout. You can do all kinds of stuff, right. And you can do this, you know, independently. You close one eye. You can smile in one direction, you know, I mean... So, whatever independent muscles, you have\u2014not counting the tongue, because there's tons of muscles in the tongue. And that's about 50. Maybe a little more. So, regardless, it's less than 100. OK, so the surface, locally, if you want to parameterize the surface occupied by all those pictures\u2014move from one picture to another\u2014 it's a surface with less than 100 parameters that determine the position of a point on that surface. Of course it's a highly nonlinear surface. It's not like this beautiful Calabi-Yau manifold here, but but it's a it is a surface nonetheless. Of course the answer was in the slide so, you know. So what you'd like is an ideal feature extractor to be able to disentangle the explanatory factors of variation of what you're observing. Right. So the different aspects of my face, you know, it's not just I move my muscles and I move my head around\u2014each of those is an independent factor of variation. Again I can also remove my glasses. You know, the lighting could change. That's another set of, you know, variable\u2014 variables. And what you'd like is a representation that basically individually represents each of those factors of variations. So if there is a criterion to satisfy in learning good representations it's that: it's finding independent explanatory factors of variation of the data that you're looking at. And the bottom line is that nobody has any idea how to do this. OK. But that would be the ultimate goal of representation learning. And we basically are at the end. OK. I'll take two more questions, if there is any. Yes. [Inaudible student question.] OK, so the question is: Is there some sort of pre-processing like PCA that will find those vectors? Yeah, so PCA will find those if the manifold is linear. So if you assume that the surface occupied by all those examples or faces is a plane, then PCA will find the dimension of that plane\u2014principal component analysis, right. But, no, it's not linear unfortunately, right. Let me... Yeah, let me give you an example. If you take me and my oldest son that looks like me, and you place us making the same face in the same position, the distance between our images will be relatively small even though we're not the same person. Now if you take my face and my face shifted by 20 pixels, there's more distance between me and myself shifted than there is between me and my son, OK. So... What that means is that, you know, the manifold of my face, you know, is some complicated manifold in that space. My son is a slight different manifold which does not intersect mine. Yet these two, those two manifolds are very close to each other, and they're closer to each other than any two samples from my manifold, and two samples from his manifold. So PCA is not going to tell you anything, basically. OK, here is another reason why that surface is not, is not a plane. You're looking at me right now. Now imagine the manifold, which is a linear manifold, one dimensional manifold, of me turning my head all the way 360. OK. That manifold is topologically identical to a circle. It's not flat. Can't be, it can't be aligned. So PCA is not going to find it. OK, I gotta blast off. Thanks! See you next week.","5_qrxVq1kvc":"Thank you for being here on time I will have only 50 minutes today, so we are going to be trying to Squeeze as much as I can without running too much. So there's gonna be like a small agreement between me and you every time we start class so the agreement is the following I'm here for Trying to communicate to you right so I'm here because I'd like to send a message across every time you don't have Idea, what's going on? You think I'm confusing you cannot understand my English you know, I have a very strong Italian accent, you know \"mamma mia!\". No, okay Yeah, I make jokes, so don't take every word I say as Truthful if I'm talking about, you know You know being aggressive or whatever. I'm joking. Most likely If I'm talking about, you know deep networks and stuff. Usually it's reliable Yeah Okay, so the point is gonna be like every time you have no idea what's going on just stop me call me: \"Alf! I've no whatever idea was going on here. Stop, repeat, explain to me again\" I will explain to you as many times it's required If you do not understand something it's almost 99.9% my fault because I haven't taken an account your background and you know, I'm skipping some steps perhaps because I'm not used to You know, maybe this class or your background or whatsoever So again, I'm here in order to educate in order to communicate and I can't do that if you don't help me, right? So if I ask a question and you understand what I'm saying, you should like nod your head because if you're like ... Yeah not reacting to my jokes or questions Then I have some issues understanding whether you are making any sense of what I'm saying If you get distracted, I will try to usually I throw chalks. We don't have a chalk here, right? I think I can try with markers but Maybe not right? Just for an undergraduates You're grownups. So you should be able to you know, keep yourself awake for the next 45 minutes more or less do not turn off because if you turn off I can't come there and take you and shake you right again. You're not undergraduates anymore. You're grownups Some of you are undergraduates, I guess so Okay, I figure out where you are if I may come and shake you up But for the others you should be able to stay awake for the next 50 minutes. I know it's like late night so try not to eat before class so you don't have like *snore* You know after dinner thingy, whatever so Yeah, so don't take me too seriously I'm Italian Right so so so inspirational like why are we here? To take an A maybe so it's a competitive class right at the end. We're gonna have a competition Don't get too scared. We do not only Like consider how you're doing well in the final ranking. We also consider, How well is your work? Right so sometimes things don't quite work, but you still apply yourselves So that's actually what matters nevertheless if you actually win the challenge you may have some gifts and presents and something from us Yep, that should be it also, if you take a very nice grade, you may come and you know join the lab perhaps with young and so on next semester, so Just saying, you know take a nice grade so you can serve later as well. Okay. All right kind of joking So neural networks, right? Did we see last time yesterday what neural networks are kind of know? So I think we mentioned a few applications one of those were classifications So let me just give you a small recap about what classification is. So what is classification? Let's say I take a picture of these of something right? Let's say I take a picture if it is a one megapixel camera So how many dimension will be my image? So if I take an image, I can consider my image which is gonna have RGB plane and it's gonna be heavy like a thousand Pixel in the vertical and one thousand pixels horizontally so you're gonna have overall 1 million pixels So one megapixel you have RGB. So how many pixels how many values will you have? 3 million, right? Ok, cool So you can think about this image which can be thought as this kind of stack of three layers is one point Living in this 3 million dimensional space and this 3 million dimensional space is really really really really large right, you can move around and Nothing happens, right? So let's say I take a picture of a dog and I have here a picture of a dog (rises right hand) Let's say I take a picture of a cat Where is gonna be a picture of a cat: here, here, or here (points far away, closer and next to right hand) Sorry Ok hands up for whose thinks, if this is my cat or dog Who thinks the other one is here? (far away) Ok Maybe you were actually paying attention yesterday who were thinking who thinks the other point is gonna be here (closer). Okay Who thinks the other point is gonna be here? (right next to each other) Fantastic, ok, so you actually on the right? So everything is just in the same damn little spot in the space (closes hand) Ok and everything everything it actually makes sense is here. Everything else is just trash and so We have to take the space go here take this point and move it here. How do you move point? Have you taken linear algebra? Yes, no Ok about linear algebra so as you may know or if you don't, now you do I do have Twitter and I'm very annoying person on Twitter because I talk a lot So, let's see Twitter. Ok open Twitter all right, so Here I cannot zoom so twitter.com right So then you go. Oh, there is no internet. See ha. Let's connect Wi-Fi Yes, I'm connecting All right, almost there Okay, so you want to do a search and you do a linear algebra You cannot see anything here. Okay. Damn. Let me zoom here Okay, so you go top right, there is the search so you do linear algebra Then you do parenthesis from me: \"alfcnz\", okay So here's how you find out what are the questions for the midterm? Right? Just check on Twitter I usually yeah leak stuff there. All right. So here you have these Actually is very nice, this book Introduction to linear algebra by Gilbert Strang so you may want to you know, look up this stuff But the other one is this one here So you'd like to check the third tweet here where I show you the essence of linear algebra by Grant Maybe you know this guy Grant Sanders if you don't know, well, you should know now Just check this link, right and this link is going to show you how you move stuff around. Okay? Anyhow, it was the first link for today. So how do you move things around in a space? For the ones that actually know how linear algebra works You just talk it down raise your hands Huh, okay matrix multiplication what does it do? rotation Cant hear. Okay first matrix multiplication is a what kind of variation Linear transformation. Okay, what are the linear transformation? one: rotation, two: You sure Stretching okay. Fantastic then, third: Stretching, scaling, I guess let's see scaling\/stretching is number two, then If the determinant is negative, what do you have (Alf turn around, showing its back) What is it? reflection, third and then one more Is it Okay, I guess we have three for the moment this should be one more Hold on so scaling right? So you have scaling this way (vertical). You have scaling in that way (horizontal) Then you have rotation Then you have reflection if there when you have reflection No no no, identity does nothing, right? So okay rotation means the matrix is orthonormal, right? cool second one you have scaling When do you have scaling? Okay Well, I wish you in fantastic So we have at the four, right? So we have rotation we have zoom in this way you have shearing, right? and then you have the Reflection whenever you have the negative determinant Cool still I want you to move things around is motion, translation a linear operation? No, yes, you can answer you don't have to rise hands Adding scalars is adding scaler a linear operation Hmm not sure Because 0 where is the 0 mapped to, right? only if the 0 is mapped to 0 then you have a linear transformation. Anyhow So you have translation which is the fourth one and a fifth operation if you use affine transformations So all those nice things you're gonna be fine them there. Ok. So check those things are very useful Anyhow, so finally we figure out that if I have everything up here We have cat, hippopotamus, dogs and whatever. I want to take them down. I want to Translate Right. Yes talk to me. No, you don't talk yet. Ok. All right So we want to use translation and then you translate this in the z-row So you have all the things here then how do you separate those things apart? So all of them are tall together, how can I (stretches space) We mentioned what are the five different- four different transformation that a linear transformation does Scaling right? How do you scale things with a Diagonal matrix fantastic cool, right, so Fantastic. So how do we diagonalize matrices? Ha that is the second question. You can figure out if you check Twitter So we open a new page we go Twitter again We go on top right should take a note about how to do this stuff. You do SVD parentheses from \"alfcnz\". Okay, cool. Now you go if you go here is like or SVD, so this is from also Gilbert, right? So you also like to check these on if you click here It's gonna be more information about midterm right last year. Oh Okay, you know too much now, okay. Anyhow, so you want to check this stuff out? Anyhow, we'll figure out that by using matrices and scalars You can move things around and then you can zoom right? And so again, I have things all collapsed here. I can't do anything so I take it down with a Translation, right? Yes, no? do like that with your head. No you following there? Yes, no, okay, it's boring No, okay Alright, so you take this one, you put it down with translation and then you zoom it right with a matrix perhaps diagonal with some Singular values right cool cool. Cool And then what so I have this thing zoomed up though. So classification. What is it? How do you perform classification now You I'd like you'd like to assign labels, but how do you do that? So whatever you would like to do is going to be basically moving these points in different regions And then you slice them Okay, and so this is problem is gonna be part of the next class And now I'm just showing you how a neural network does this? I hope you're gonna be enjoying this video If I find my cursor, okay So All right, so we start from here Full screen, perhaps. All right, so can you see anything? No, how do you turn off the lights? Can someone figure out how to oh maybe here Yes, no good night, hold on All right, good night so At least then I'd turn it back so here we start with these five branches of a spiral and you can see that each point is gonna be basically Represented as what how can you represent each of those points without the color? Okay, where do these points live On a 2d plane, right? So this is a 2d plane this screen here. So each of those points is represented as a As a tuple, right, that is representing the X and the Y coordinate, then the color there represents a third dimension Where it's going to be basically Representing the class to which each of those points belong and here we have five different branches of a spiral So this is the input to my network is going to be a bunch of points without Colors and then I ask my network to separate the points by color. Okay. Is it clear? What is the task I ask my network? You can not rise your hands because I cannot see sh*t, right? *laughs* So you have to shout back because I don't see you understand right what's going on here if sorry not right now, so we start with this guy here, which is Just five branches of a spiral the network doesn't see the colors right now and the network will try to separate the colors apart. So This is what my network does It takes the space the space space fabric and it performs like a stretching of the space fabric, right? how cool does that sound and You should do like oh, oh See, okay. Yeah, we had to do multiple iterations. I think here this your first class. It's okay to be shy Alright, so this is my network Which is basically stretching the space fabric in order to get all those points that are belonging to the same color to the same class To be in the same subspace of this final manifold such that once we reach convergence, so whenever we reach at the end of this animation you Have all your points that belongs to different spirals Very separable And so now you can just use logistic regression, right or like one versus all whatever regression is called Yeah, I don't know. So I mean this is the last matrix is represented by that That for five arrows there. So of those five arrows represent a matrix, which is how many rows how many columns So what is my output dimension here of this network? What are we trying to infer in this case? The classes how many classes do we have? five, so the number of rows of this matrix will be Five right because they are height of the matrix is they the same dimension where you shoot in two and the width of the matrix? Represents the space where you're shooting from right? And so what is going to be my width of this matrix? Two, right? so this matrix is going to be a high times two because we are shooting towards five dimensions the five colors over here and then And then we have two columns, right? So it's gonna be basically the two coordinates of the tip of the arrow and those arrows are just centered in zero We're going to talk about more about that intersection I guess in later lessons if I actually may manage to make a video about that, but can you see that kind of cute? intersection at the center Have you ever seen that kind of intersection before? Have you ever taken a bath? I mean oh, yeah bubbles, right? So whenever you have multiple bubbles touching together, it looks like similar to that Perhaps maybe not that I don't know. It looks to me Alright, so that was the first Network Okay and this is how this network work these networks basically take the space fabric and then apply some kind of Transformation which is still parametrized by matrices. So I have many many matrices then I have Nonlinearities, why do I need Many matrices or why do I need nonlinearities? Can I turn on the light? Oh, you still like to watch? Okay Yeah, otherwise you'll start sleeping All right So so Here it basically this guy here is gonna be a network with two matrices my first matrix maps My input which is living in which space? Two dimensions to a intermediate layer of 100 dimensions So my network architecture is the following so I have my two neurons here. I met this one two, one two three, so on here, I have 100 Then I have some non-linearity which is going to be just the positive part and then from this guy here, I Do something Cute or funny or weird? I don't know depends. So from here I map down to Okay, what should I do after let's say this is this is my network. What's gonna be the last layer of this network? 5 right?, but how many dimension has this screen? So, how can I plot there? and don't say PCA So I do this one Okay Such that I can show you there the linear interpolation between this point here, which I call embedding in this case but just a way I call this stuff right now and my input Okay Alright that's pretty much it so this is my neural network has one input layer one hidden layer One kind of embedding layer, which does nothing and an output layer. Okay, so it has one hidden and overall I count this as three layer neural network, because it is one two, and then this stuff is linear, right? so why do we need nonlinearities and What can one layer-, okay, he said: Without non-linearity it would look like a single layer neural network and a single layer neural network what can it do? Scaling, Translation, Rotation, Reflection, and? I guess, shearing, right? Okay, so guess what's going to be the next part of this class? Let's let's check how one one linear one network with one layer works. Okay questions so far Also there in the yeah For just displaying stuff on the screen more questions again, don't raise hands you can just talk to me Can you hear me the over there is everything okay? Awesome. Alright. Thank you for approval So these two points here represent the coordinates of my input points, right So this is gonna be my x-coordinate and my y-coordinate of the input space This one is going to be my x-coordinate and my y-coordinate of these embedding space which is linearly separable Given that I have, you know, I am Obtained 100% accuracy with the training we haven't talked about training yet, but does it make any sense the answer what I gave you? Okay, yeah So this is just a way to visualize five dimensions in two dimensions instead of doing a PCA, I just do a PCA Hold on hasn't finished Because I'd like to see what the network output looks like in two dimensions, okay Why is that true or is that false you see that next time it doesn't shrink because again those two You can see multiply them together, right? It looks like one singular matrix one single matrix And actually this works better More about this later on in the class actually Yann is going to be talking about this Okay, we still have some time all right, so how did I make these animations First option: I'm a magician Why you're laughing?, it's actually true. But anyhow, I know how to use matplotlib I've taken this class three times and I never pass it Okay, all of those are three All the three are true. I never taken the class. But okay. I mean I've been on the other side Yes, so this is not magic, right so this is just visualization using matplotlib free open source code in an PyTorch, which is going to be our library, which are going to be using for the Right in these models. It's very it's very very convenient was made by a student of mine back, I guess in 2016, so You know be that cool. I'm just kidding. You can be even more cool. All right more questions No, okay, so now we actually can go to the more concrete part, right, so this was kind of abstract I gave you some interesting You know delicious I guess appetizer. Let's get on the main course and let's see how you can actually get started. Okay, so Everything you're gonna be seen in my classes or in my github repository, which you are gonna be forced to star Now I'm just kidding But if you don't star it, I will take notice All right, github.com\/atcold so it cold stays for something weird So my Italian name is Alfredo, \"fredo\" can mean \"cold\" and \"al\" can mean \"at\" So that \"atcold\" is gonna be like kind of transliteration of my name So atcold You go there Yet, it's me how cute and the first one with one thousand and three hundred stars, and I guess you have two hundred so I should be 1500 by tonight It's not the class repository for the class. Right? And so you're gonna be if you don't have so you should have like a UNIX, actually no, PyTorch works or something on Windows I don't use Windows so I have no idea. But if you have a Mac or a Linux machine everything works. Just fine. If you have a Windows it should work as well. I haven't tried So how do you access this stuff you go there? Here you're gonna have the page website as soon as we actually make it we are going to be actually looking at the Repo, sorry, The notebook number two right now If we have time left, we can also check a bit of a more basic introduction to the tensor tutorial How many of you have no idea what numpy or numpy whatever you want to call it is ends up. Don't be shy So I'll change my question now Do does everyone here in class know about numpy and has it used before? Is it are you gonna be shaking your hand? Just shake your head, right? So who is no whatsoever idea what numpy is and how it works and never use Python before you know, it happened Don't don't laugh. Okay Because if you don't know about that, there is also the zero zero class where you implement things from scratch But I guess there's too much back So I guess the number one it perhaps is not too worthy going over. We see if we have some time left It basically gives you some introduction about how to use basic pytorch routines for creating tensors which are basically multi-dimensional arrays in an amp I And so it creates tensors multiply tensors it just Initialize create random stuff. So it's it's not that different from numpy again We can check them out if we can check this out if we have some time afterwards Otherwise, it's gonna be like left as an assignment to go over this It should be very easy gentle introduction to how to get started with the API. Ok Complains about this No, wow Are you shy or you're too nice? Ok You're not laughing. Ok. All right, so Ok, I'm joking, but you're not getting the jokes is fine. One more advertisement is type. Aura this type or a thing I love it so much is a markdown editor where you can write down your Notes in latex and markdown, right so you can write for example You know, whatever soft argmax which is something you're going to be learning about which I call it this way So you can use latex in a markdown file. It looks very good for example I here I annotate Articles I I read okay. So this is TYPORA T Y  P O R A. Okay. That's just you know Promotional message I don't get paid so, you know, it's Franco, okay All right. So, how do we get started there? we open the terminal we Zoom such that you can see something so we can go for example inside or this is going to be different Let's say we go inside that fall inside that repository Icon somewhere else which is gonna be my notebooks and then my video something video lessons Okay, so you're going to be basically running Conda activate deep learning mini course and Everything just works If you have installed and you have followed the instructions in the readme, okay, so right now if you just type ipython Ipython with pylab It open you can do import Torch for example just to see whether everything works and then you can type for example torch dot R and and Five and this one is going to be typing creating a tensor with five number Which are randomly picked from zero to one uniform distribution, okay So this is just to check that everything just works fine. If this works, then we can actually start and playing with the notebooks You're not kind of I mean, you can try to follow along in class with the computer But I rather I think it's better for you to actually follow and what I do here you know, I'm a clown I try to engage with you if you isolate yourself with the Computer maybe sometimes you may lose some of some of the nuggets I give you Anyhow, so it looks like everything works here. So I'm gonna be just opening the Jupiter notebook And things are black because I like them this way Yeah, black is good. Alright, so we're gonna see this random projection to be starting so Yeah I'm let me go fullscreen You should be complaining if you don't see things, right? I kind of know what you see what you don't know what you see what you don't see but if you Provide feedback live like I can't read anything or can you turn off the light? That would be also useful Okay, so do interrupt me to Talk to me. Can you see is he okay? Yes, no Thank you All right. Let me turn off that one - all right. Okay, so I do here. I just what I do here I'm gonna just import some utilities. I find for plotting stuff Then here I just import torch and then from torch I import this NN library Which is simply I'm gonna be importing the matrix multiplication and the addition of our vector, okay? so matrix multiplication is gonna be a linear operation plus the Bias, but plus the translation we have the affine transformation Which is the one we were talking about with the five different transformations, and then we're going to be important I guess some nonlinear function somewhere Moreover I import from applet leave those Things for plotting things. I also important. Um pipe is NP Non pine on PI, I don't know is it numpy number or Mumbai with numeric people complain about the atom? Anyhow, so I use some default things and okay. This is the first line torch specific line. So this is gonna be device equal torch dot device CUDA 0 if CUDA is available otherwise CPU. What is this if I am running these? Examples on a chip on a machine which has a GPU Automatically porch will run on the GPU memory So your machine has a CPU which makes only sequential operations one after each other Musty might be very very very fast, but it still sequential right? It's like your brain you can only do one thing at a time If you try to drive and smoke and funk take a phone call Yeah, you might not be here tomorrow so you can only do one thing at a time, right? And it's like the CPU of a computer and then you have some local memory, which is the main memory is called RAM random access Memory on the other side. If you would like to speed up things you can use something that is much slower Which is called GPU so why would you use a GPU which is slower? Than a CPU to speed up your computations Because although it's very very much slower it can perform many many many more computation at the same time, right? So if the CPUs might be like like running very quickly from one side to the other It's gonna be beating your GPU so many times but the GPU does Okay Alright, so the GPU will have a memory which is called device memory, which is which lives on the GPU I think right now they are planning to get some Access to the main memory of the CPU from the GPU. I think they are working on that. I don't think it's yet out Anyhow, if you work on the GPU, you will have to create your tensors in the GPU maintain the in the GPU memory But you don't have to worry about that as long as you specify that thing over there at the beginning of your code my torch will take care and will put your Tensors in the right location for you. If you're going to be using a TPU a tensor processing unit from Google similarly You're gonna have pi torch putting your tensors in the TPU memory Which is close to the actual processing unit there which is going to make your operation, you know computed in a faster way so this is a Stupid single line, but it's important. Okay Again about the Pytorch stuff you won't be Tested in the midterm Midterm is going to be mostly about math This study is going to be essential for actually managing to succeed in the final project Okay, so if you are trying to beat others while using CPUs, and they are using GPUs You know, good luck okay, and yeah, I'm ironic but You know people tried and And then complain and then I don't want complaints. Okay. Alright, so here we create 1,000 points and Actually, I do this one. Okay, so one underscore zero zero zero is the same as one thousand But it's better to read and so here I have 1,000 points and my X capital X is gonna be my design matrix It's gonna be having 1,000 rows and two columns. Okay, and it's sampled from our random and Distribution, so if you go here you press shift tab You're going to be having this thing opening up and you can click here. You're gonna see what is this stuff, right? So R and R on the end is gonna be able to turn a tensor field with random numbers from a normal distribution With mean 0 and variance 1 also called the standard normal distribution. Okay. So, how did I open the help? Do you know this stuff? Have you ever used notebooks before is the first time you saw this help, you know? Some of you may have seen this the first time Ok. So, how are these capital X going to be looking? Like how are these set of points? What what is your expectation for this set of points? You're supposed to interact Small values near to zero. Okay. So you're going to have a cloud of points. What is going to be the radius of your cloud? It's again No I'm just speaking since I don't like distributions I'm gonna have like a bunch of points which are going to be basically somehow circularly distributed I'd like to know what is the average radius of this? blob 1\/2 Warfare's more or less Zero average So you have the expectation of the square of the X square, right? Square root of the expectation but whatever like expectation of the square root of the sum of the squares, right? Okay. Someone said 1\/2 cool guys once more who beats more Say again? that that or 1 so you have the standard deviation is gonna be 1 So are you gonna get points outside of the standard deviation or not? You know the bell curve right? Where is the one standard deviation? Close to the center far away how much larger than the standard deviation is the bell? Okay, roughly Try to guess just shoot numbers, it's okay. I don't judge you yet No you too shy okay, where is my student answer I Can't find You fine not fine, okay There we go What is this stuff it's cute I know Can you see anything let me should I lower it okay. I just lowered the light whatever people with Eric in the recording are gonna be complaining but Okay, still I don't know how to turn off the first thing so you got get dark So what are those red and green arrows there? Okay, you can you can guess right I don't bite you The axe is fantastic which axis? What is the length of those things? Come on? You need right? So those are the unit vectors Y. Y1 is red one while the other is green Okay, fantastic Which one is X which one is Y X is the red one. Why is that because you have RGB and right because you have taken some graphic just before this So R is gonna be always right is gonna be always the x-axis green is gonna be always the y-axis Those are unit vectors and therefore this cloud of points spends, roughly What is the average radius here can you guess more or less Three fantastic, that was the answer. Okay, so you have a cloud of points roughly large three, right? Uniformly like circularly distribute the rain sort of all right cool. So we're gonna run now You can try to put like this arrow here one more arrow here one more arrow here you have three arrows there, okay More or less. I'm a physicist, right? Yeah later. I will be mortician. Okay now I'm a mathematician so Realizing, you know transformations see here. I compute the SVD singular value decomposition Again, there's the video I pointed out before so I'm gonna be multiplying this This cloud of point by a matrix, so what does the matrix do to these circular blob? Come on, you know this stuff you will be repeated three times so far. What do you expect to? See you? Have a circle here. What do you expect to see afterwards? a Potato yes, correct. So first potato and this is a very squished one. So why is he what's happen here? What's happen in the y-direction? All right, so how is this matrix It's a cute matrix is the rotation matrix is an annoying matrix How are the eigen what are the singular values look look here one singular value is almost close to 0, right? So this is our almost singular matrix So this is what's happening. It's gonna kill one dimension. This one didn't kill it yet But basically you have that the dimensions in the diagonal right in the singular value decomposition Represent the amount of zooming you have in the different direction and then the first two matrices the first and the last one Represent the rotation that these metrics apply This other one has a factor of two in one direction and the zero six in the other one So you get this stuff here Oh something else. Hold on So here you have blue green yellow red, right so our our G alone. No, there is no order here We have blue green yellow red and then here you have blue red Yellow green. So what's happened here? How's the determinant? Negative why is that Because you had a Reflection that's correct. All right, I'll keep going you can see here different Things right? So you have more potatoes here and this is actually zooming a lot. You have one point three This also is kind of zooming a little Okay, this one does nothing Okay, boring, right, oh, okay what's happen here, how are these metrics It's gonna be singular right almost you can see the one singular value is gonna be zero point zero three, it's very tiny You can see these are the unit vectors. There are very big arrows here means it has squashed down, right? The first one is 0 6 the other one is 0 0 3 so you can basically almost killed a dimension here And so on. Okay, so no much Stuff anyhow, you can do the same things with Pytorch now, so this can be the first instruction You're gonna be seen about Pytorch So here I do model is going to be a sequential which is basically a Container where I can put a few a few modules one after each other and my first module is going to be a NN linear Which means what does and then linear means? Doesn't mean a linear transformation because these people were Guest programmers so, you know, they don't know I guess this is an affine transformation But actually it's a linear transformation because I said bias equals false. Okay. So this is actually just a matrix multiplication So it is a linear transformation. Okay maps to 0 to 0 Then I do model to device I ship the model to the memory of the GPU and then I remove the gradients You're gonna figure out this next week what it is I'm gonna bet get here. My Y is gonna be the output of the model to which I input the X Then I generate my figure and I plot this stuff. So this is to show you that You can also get a singular matrix with the Pytorch. How cool is this? No, it's boring, right? I mean you can see you can multiply data by matrix matrices by using the Pytorch package And so we had to create a model Sequential container we put inside the linear module. We remove the bias the translation and you get this stuff Why did I remove the translation? Because otherwise I had to fetch it and it goes outside the screen so I keep it in the center. Okay? All right, so Let's have this one. So right now I'm gonna just use the following I just use a matrix That is I think I didn't pick curl. No, it's gonna be identity matrix Which I scale both items in the diagonal by the same item by the same value And then I apply a nonlinear function. So my nonlinear function is gonna be the following. It's a hyperbolic tangent which goes to Minus 1 roughly when you cross the minus 2.5 here at the bottom and it goes to to put goes to one Roughly whenever you cross the plus 2.5 okay up here so this stuff Maps, what the whole Real line to wear so plus infinity goes to one and minus infinity goes to Until you reach the linear region, which is roughly minus two point five to two point five Why do I mention this name in these numbers? Because sometimes you're gonna put your nose inside your model it is not training and you still want to figure out the order of Magnitude and you know the rough the number which are kind of associated to the kink of these nonlinearities Anyhow, so I just create this one which is very very similar to the thing. I just show you before Which has Where is it here? So here I have my sequential which is the sequence of Operations I use a matrix first so this linear to two then I applied the tanh and Then I increased the I think the multiplier for that diagonal matrix So that's what you get. So this is my cloud. What do you expect to see of my cloud? So what is the range of this cloud we said it's roughly It goes from minus 3 to plus 3 right? Where is the kink happening? So everything that is outside these two point five minus two point five two plus two point five box is going to be mapped to one things that are inside Stay roughly the same that's correct. So what do you expect to see after this image over here? You expect to have inbox your data but what is going to be the size of this box Are you sure so the the suggestion was from minus two point five to two point five? The box is going to be 2 minus 1 2 plus 1 so minus 1 minus 1 I mean all the box from minus 1 to plus 1 But then the points inside are going to be mapped according to the mapping We were mentioning before so things from minus two point five to two point five are getting linearly Squeezed and then things outside at two point five number are going to be squashed down to the Basically edge of this box. Okay. Are you ready to see how to box a normal distribution? Are you excited? Okay, just two people just said that I mean are we excited come on give me some satisfaction Okay, you're not playing with me okay, I see I'm trying to be nice to you oh Oh, thank you at least at work, right? So that was first one So in this case here, I'll just show you just my identity matrix. I didn't do anything and here things are kind of What kind of distribution looks this? I mean what what does it look like? Come on? Oh It's a uniform kind of between Minus 1 to plus 1 fantastic in 2d, what does it happen now if I start doing a little bit If I start multiplying instead of having identity matrix now, I have the 2x2 matrix or 3x3 or 4x4 5x5 Say again? The points will go for further to the edges so you're gonna be seeing these and these and these and Finally this huh? Oh, hey Cool hah? So what happens here? We met by our cloud. It was like circular into this kind of boxy thing How good is that now? Those little points are very very spread apart And so you can actually tell them apart if you are for example Classifying stuff finally in the last minute then I do let you go It's going to be using random matrices but in this way, so here I'm gonna have my sequential I Put like a linear layer Which also has the bias terms is affine transformation I go from two to this hidden layer dimension Which is going to be five, so I go to two to five I applied the ReLU which is simply the positive part operator And then I apply another affine transformation that goes to five to two such that I can display them on the screen Okay, is it clear what I'm doing, so I create a sequential which is a sequence of modules I have three modules The first module is a matrix mapping Matrix of height five with two so it shoots towards high dimensions it from a to two dimensional input space There is a bias which is going to be five dimensional. Then you remove you set to zero everything. That is negative And now you map this five dimensional space Whatever down to two dimensions, so you're gonna have a matrix that has two rows and five columns And then there is a bias of height like of size two. Okay. Did you follow? If you didn't follow you can find in the recording because I'm gonna play press play. Are you ready? Mmm, okay some engagement Okay, it didn't work. Sorry. Okay. Okay fantastically. They know I did so this is the beginning right? that's the starting point and then you get Yes, you're allowed to do oh It's fine. Oh, oh, this is all right. This is very spiky So you're gonna figure out in the next class what happened here, but this is a very different thing right. This is this smooth transformations Somehow smooth. This is very very Angular, right? and design and How cute is this right so finally final remarks and then I let you go I know it's dinner time for sorry for keeping you here to me if late so final remarks are the following then Yeah, check the Piazza so this is basically a untrain neural network those I just show you in the module with the three items the linear transformation Positive part the end transformation or affine transformation is your first linear deep neural network? It's not that deep but still makes pretty damn awesome Drawings I think in my opinion so I'm like a just initialize network an untrained Network We start with this kind of transformation, but we have seen from the first video I show you tonight that we are aiming for a Transformation which is, you know instrumental to perform a specific task, which is for example The classification of those points that are belonging to the different five spiral So in the next class we're going to figure out how do I take this? initial, you know arbitrary transformation and I can pull it apart and manipulate such that I achieve the final goal, which is for example Make my points linearly separable in the final layer. Okay, so this is gonna be for the next class otherwise stay warm And I see you next time, bye-bye","OrBEon3VlQg":"so since last time okay welcome back\nthank you for being here last time yang was using the tablet\nright and how can you use the tablet I don't use the tablet right so I should\nbe as cool as the Anna at least I think one more thing to begin with there is a\nspreadsheet where you can decide whether you'd like to join the slack channel\nwhere we collaborate over making like some drawings for the website fixing\nsome mathematical notations having some kind of you know fixing the error in\nEnglish in the English grammar or whatever so if you if you're interested\nin a help in improving the content of this class feel free to fill out the\nspreadsheet okay we are already a few of us on the slug channel so I mean if you\nwant to join if we are you're welcome so instead of writing on the whiteboard\nbecause it's impossible to see I think from the upper side we're gonna be going\nto experiment with a new toy here all right\nfirst time so you know I'm a little bit tense last time I screw up with a\nnotebook so okay alright so we're gonna be talking starting with a small review\nabout linear algebra I hope I'm not offending anyone I'm aware that you\nalready taken linear algebra and you're very strong in it but nevertheless I'd\nlike to provide you my intuition my perspective okay it's just you know one\nslide not too much so maybe you'd like to take out some paper and pen or you\ncan just you know whatever follow along so so this one is going to be linear and\nlinear algebra review okay am i waiting a little bit let me\nwait for a sec ready yes no shake your head okay fantastic alright so we were\ntalking last time we had a neural network with the input on the bottom\nthen we had like an affine transformation then we have a hidden\nlayer right so I'm gonna just write the first equation we're gonna have that my\nhidden layer and since I'm writing on with a pen can you see anything yeah\nso since I'm writing with a pen I'm going to be putting a underscore\nunderneath the variable in order to indicate it's a vector okay that's how I\nwrite vectors so my H is gonna be a nonlinear function f apply to my Z and\nZed is gonna be my linear input okay the linear when the output of the\naffine transformation so in this case I'm gonna be writing here Z is going to\nbe equal to my matrix a times X okay we can imagine there is no bias in this\ncase it's generic enough because we can include it bias inside the matrix and\nhave the first item of the X equal to B 1 so if this X here belongs to RN and is\ndead here belongs to RM first question what is the size of this matrix okay\nfantastic right so this matrix here is gonna be our M times n you have as many\nrows as the dimension where you should - and you have as many columns the\ndimension where you're shooting from ok all right so let's expand this one right\nso this matrix here is gonna be equal to what do you have a 1 1 a 1 2 so on until\nthe last one which is gonna be shout thank you 1\nand yeah 1n then you have second one's gonna have 1 a 2 1 a 2 2 so on until the\nlast one which is 2 n right and then you keep going down until the last one which\nis going to be what are the indexes M 1 right okay so you had a and 1 a M 2 and\nso on until amen okay thank you all right and then we have here our X right\nso you have X 1 X 2 and so on until xn right you're more responsive than last year\ngood thank you alright so we can also rewrite this one in different ways so\nthe first way I'm gonna write this one is gonna be the following so I'm gonna\nhave here these a 1 then I'm gonna have here my a 2 and then I have the last one\nwhich is gonna be my a and ok and then here I'm gonna be multiplying this by a\ncolumn vector right so my column vector I'm gonna be write it like this alright\nso what is the output of this operation so these are metrics you have a vector\nthe outcome is going to be a vector so what is gonna be the first item of my\nvector I don't use dots because I'm not a physicist actually I am that we are\ndoing linear algebra so what should I write alright so that's already transpose\nbecause those are a row vector so I just write a I'm gonna just mean just right\nright so I have a 1 X ok so there is no transposition here no dots around and so\non second element is gonna be a two okay X and then until the last one which is\ngonna be D okay there's no dot but sure like someone is calling that dot product\ninstead of the cross product but that is assumes like you use a different kind of\nnotation all right so and this is gonna be my so\nhow many elements does this vector have M okay so we have Z 1 Z 2 and so on\nuntil Z M and this is my final set right my vector is that okay fantastic so now\nwe are going to be focusing a little bit about the meaning of this thing over\nhere okay other questions so far all right this is very trivial so far I\nhope I mean let me know if if not okay okay so let's analyze one of these guys\nhere so I'd like to figure out what is the meaning of writing a T times X right\nso my a T is gonna be my generic a I so let's assume in this case when n equal\nto okay so what is ATX so ATX is going to be equal to what so let me draw here\nsomething so that is gonna be easier for you to understand so this one is gonna\nbe my a are these gonna be my alpha and then here you have like it's gonna be my\nX and is this gonna be here my X I so what is this what is the output of this\nproduct here these are here see you can sorry 8\/8 transpose it let's\ncall it let's say that is a row vector can you see know what is gonna be the\noutput of this operation here no why this is this is like a generic one of\nthe many aids right there are M aids this is one of those mas so I'm\nmultiplying one of those A's times my X right let's assume there are only two\ndimensions so what is gonna be the output of this scalar product can\nsomeone tell me no no no like normal scalar product hold on\nso you have egg hey here do you have here this part here is gonna be a 1 it\nis gonna be a two okay then you have here x1 and now you have x2 right so how\ndo you express this scalar product here okay so I'm just writing let me know if\nyou took clear so I'm gonna write here a 1 times X 1 plus a 2 times X 2 right\nthis is the definition clear right so far yeah no okay yeah question yeah that\nis meant to be a transpose Y a role times column vector so let's assume a is\na column vector then I have role x colouring so let's keep writing this\nstuff here so what is a 1 how can i compute AI a 1 second ok ok\nso I'm gonna write here the a 1 is going to be the length of vector a times\ncosine alpha then what about X 1 someone else the same right now wait what what\nis X 1 same thing right different letters so someone say something you're\nfollowing you're completely confused you're not having any idea it's too easy\nI have no idea what's going on here it's good right so far ok what's gonna be the\nsecond term the this one is gonna be X here write x cos x I right and then you\nhad the second term which is going to be what magnitude of a shout I can hear ok\nsine of alpha and then okay thank you okay all right I'm gonna be just putting\ntogether those two guys so you're gonna get equal magnitude of a times magnitude\nof x times cosine alpha cosine Phi plus sana sine alpha and sine cosine a sine X\nI sorry what is be starting the parentheses all\nright so there's the cosine of the difference of the two angle right\neveryone knows trigonometry here right sorry high school stuff so this one is\ngonna be equal to a x times the cosine of cos x i minus alpha right oh the\nother way around right from monoxides so what does this mean you can think\nabout each element so far is clear I I didn't do any magic yeah shake your head\nlike these four yes these four no this for maybe no something's working okay so\nyou can think about whenever you multiply a matrix times a vector that\nbasically each output of this operation is gonna be measuring so okay hold on\nwhat is this cosine how much is cosine of zero one so it means if these two\nangles if the two vectors are aligned which means there is a zero angle\nbetween the two vectors you can have the maximum value of this element right\nwhenever when you have the minus the most negative value when they are\nopposite right so when they're in opposition of phase you're gonna get the\nmost negative magnitude but then if you apply just let's a redo you're gonna cut\nall those negative things you're just checking for the positive matches right\nso neural net basically just perhaps who's gonna be figuring out only the\npositive matches right and so again when you multiply a matrix times a column\nvector you be performing element-wise sorry scalar\nproduct between each column each row of the matrix which represents your kernel\nright so whenever you have like a linear layer your kernel is gonna be the whole\nrow of the matrix and now you see what is the projection of that input on that\ncolumn I am on the input on that flow right so each element of this product is\ngoing to tell you the alignment with which the input is what is the alignment\nof the input with respect to the specific row of the matrix okay\nyes no this should shape some more like intuition while we are using these\nlinear transformations they are like allowing you to see the projection of\nthe input onto different kind of orientations let's say this way okay you\ncan try to you know extrapolate this in high dimensions I guess the intuition at\nleast I can give it to you works definitely in two and three dimensions\nin higher dimensions I kind of think it works in a similar way next lesson we\nare going to watch we are actually we are going to see how what is the\ndistribution of the projections in a higher dimensional space is this sort\ngonna be so cool I think all right so this was the first part of I think of\nthe class oh well there is one more more part so actually here this said here we\ncan also write it in a different way so maybe this is maybe it's known maybe\nit's not known when I saw it first time I didn't know so you know it's it's cool\nthat sometimes you see these things once again maybe so let's go back here is the\nthings that there and so you can express this Z as being equal the vector a 1 in\nthis case a 1 is gonna be the first column of the a matrix ok and this one\nis going to be multiplied by the scalar x1 now you have the second column of the\nmatrix so I have a 2 this is multiplied by the second element of the X right\nuntil the last one which is gonna be again I can't hear if it's M or n m like\nthis or end you know sign language which one n right you know sign language no\nyou should learn it's good you know inclusivity a and write the last column\ntimes your X and of course because n X has a size of n there are n items right\nand so basically when you also when you do a you know transformation a linear\nyou know apply a linear operator you can't be basically waiting each column\nof the matrix with the coefficient that is in a you know you have first column\ntimes the first coefficient of the vector second column and by the second\nitem plus third column times the third item and so you can see the output of\nthis DN transformation is a weighted sum of the columns of the a matrix okay so\nthis is a different kind of intuition sometimes you see these as like whenever\nyou want to express your signal your data is a combination of different you\nknow the composition this is kind of a linear composition of your input alright\nso that was the first part it is the recap about the linear algebra a second\npart is going to be something even more cool I think questions so far\nno easy too easy you're getting bored sorry okay all right then I'm gonna\nspeed up I guess alright so let's see how we can extend\nthe one that the stuff we have seen right now to convolutions right so maybe\nconvolution sometimes are a little bit weird let's see how we can do an\nextension to convolutions all right so let's say I start with the\nsame matrix so I'm gonna have here four rows and then three columns okay so my\ndata has to be if I had if I had this matrix if I multiply this to a column my\ncolumn vector should be of size three thank you all right so let me draw here\nmy column vector of size right and this is gonna give you a output of size four\nokay fantastic but then is your data let's say you're\ngonna listen to some nice audio audio file is your data just three simple long\nhow long is gonna be your data let's say you listening to a piece of music that\nis like three minutes how many sample does three minutes of\nall your health yeah I guess what is gonna be my sampling rate let's say\ntwenty two okay twenty two thousand kilo Hertz right 22 kilohertz so how many\nsamples three minutes of music have second you sure is monophonic\nor stereophonic just kidding okay so you're gonna multiply the number of\nsample the number of seconds right number of seconds times the frame rate\nright the okay the frequency in this case anyhow so this signal is gonna be\nvery very long right it's gonna be keep going down so if I have a vector that is\nvery very long I have I have to use a matrix which is gonna be very very fat\nwide right okay fantastic so this top keeps going this direction\nalright so my question for you is gonna be what should I put in this location\nhere what should I put here so do we care\nabout things that are further away no why not\nbecause our data has the property of locality fantastic so what am I gonna go\nwhat am I gonna be putting here a big zero right fantastic mom okay so we put\na zero here and then what is the other property so let me start drawing this\nstuff again right so can I have my kernel of size three and then here I\nhave my data which is gonna be very long right so hold on I can see all right so\nhere there are zero then let's say what is the other property my my my date my\nnatural data have stationarity which means the pattern that you expect to\nfind this can be kind of repeating over and over again right and so if I have\nhere my three values here perhaps I'd like to reuse them over and over again\nright and so if these three values let me change the color maybe so you can see\nin there is the same stuff so I have three values here and then I'm gonna be\nusing these three same values one step for the rain and I keep going further I\ndon't down and I keep going this way all right so what should I put here on the\nbottom what should I put here a zero right why that why is that because of\nlocality of the data right so putting zeros around is called it's also called\npadding but in this case it's called sparsity right so this is like sparsity\nand then the replication of this thing that is over and over over again\nit's called session I'd was the property of the signal this is called weight\nsharing yeah okay fantastic all right so how many how\nmany values do we have now how many parameters I have on the right hand side well so we have three parameters over\nleft on the left hand side instead we had product right so if the right side\nis gonna be easy is the right side gonna work at whole you have three parameters\none side on the other side you have 12 okay that is good using locality and\nspiral and whatever not like sparsity and parameter sharing but then now we\nend up with just three parameters isn't this too restrictive how can we have\nmultiple multiple parameter what's missing here in the big picture there\nare multiple channels right so this is just one layer here and then you have\nthis stuff coming out from the from the from the board here so you have the\nfirst kernel down here now he has some second kernel let's say listen and I\nhave last one here right and so you have each plane of these metrics being\ncontaining just one kernel which is replicated multiple times who knows the\nname of this matrix now so this is gonna be called triplets top list matrix okay so what is the main feature of\nthese topless metrics what is the big big big thing that you won't notice it's\na sparse matrix okay okay what is gonna be here this first item over here what\nis the content of the first guy yeah so this one here is gonna be the extension\nof my linear transformation which was you know I have a signal that is longer\nthan three samples therefore I have to make this matrix fatter second part is\nmight be given that I don't care about what things like things that are here\ndown I don't care about things that are here if I look at the points that are up\nhere so gonna be putting a big 0 here such that Oh everything that is down\nhere it gets cleaned up right and then finally I'm gonna be using the same\nkernel over and over again because I assume that my data is stationary and\ntherefore I assume that similar patterns are gonna be happening over and over\nagain therefore I'm gonna be using this one which is written here parameter\nsharing weight sharing finally given that this one gives you\nonly three parameter two parameters to work with I will use several layers in\norder to have different you know channels so this one is one kernel\nbefore one kernel was the whole row of the matrix okay so when you have a fully\nconnected layer the only difference between a fully connected layer and a\nconvolution is that you have the full dam row of the matrix so what is gonna\nbe in this first item over here anyone so the green colonel let's call the\ngreen corner just a one let me actually make it glow green because it's green\nkarna so you have a one times what it's gonna be from the number one to number\nthree right and then the second item is gonna be same same dude here a 1 and\nthen you're gonna have the X shifted by one and so on right make sense yeah and\nthen we're gonna have this one is going to be the green output then you're gonna\nhave the blue output one layer coming out and then you have the further one\nthe red one coming we've been one layer out okay what's the\niPad experience cool yes no I liked it okay other questions so again the blue circle this one it's a\nbig zero that's the sparsity one the same is here yes no yeah yeah yeah green so here I just put a lot of\nzeros inside here so I killed all the values that are away from the little\npart and then I repeat the same three values over and over again because I\nexpect to find the same pattern in different regions of this is the big big\nsignal I have this one here so I said that in this case I'm gonna have just\nthree values right and we started with 12 values and I ended up with 3 which is\nreally really little so if I'd like to have let's say 6 values then if I want\nto have six values and I can have my second 3 on a different plane and I\nperform the same operation whenever you multiply this matrix times a vector you\nperform a convolution so it just to tell you that a convolution is just a matrix\nmultiplication with a lot of zeros that's it yeah so they're gonna have\nthis one here then you have a second one you have a third one so you have three\nversions of the input alright so for a second part of the class I'm gonna be\nshowing you some more interactive things please do participate to the second part\nas well alright so let's try so I have rebranded I have rebranded the website\nand now has slightly some like that the environment is going to be called P PBL\nso pi torch deep learning instead of sleep learning mini course it was too\nlong so let me start by running this one so my torch deep learning so we can do this\nConda activate activate PI torch deep learning and then let's open not the\nJupiter notebook all right so now you're gonna be watching the going over the\nlistening to corners so I show you a convolution on paper well on my tablet\nnow got me making listening to convolution so can such that you can\nreally appreciate what this compositions are here we said a the new kernel right\nwhich is called P PBL Python sleep learning so you're gonna notice the same\nkind of you know procedure if you update your system alright so in this case we\ncan read the top here so let me hide the top here alright so given the assumption of\nlocality stationarity and composition compositionality we can reduce the\namount of computation for a matrix vector multiplication by using a sparse\nbecause local popplets matrix because stationary scheme in this way we can\nsimply end up rediscovering the convolution operator array moreover we\ncan also recall that a scalar product is a simply a normalized cosine distance\nwhich tells us the alignment of two vectors\nmore specifically we compute the magnitude of the orthogonal projection\nof two vectors onto the other and vice versa\nso let's figure out now how all these can make sense by using our ears okay so\ni'm going to be importing a library that professor here at NYU made and here I'm\ngonna be just loading my audio data and I'm gonna have that in my X and then my\nsampling grade is going to be in the other variable so here I'll just\nshow you I'm gonna have like 70,000 samples in this case because I have a\nsimple in rate of 22 kilo Hertz and then my total time is gonna be three seconds\nokay so three seconds times 22 you get what so it's not 180 you were saying it\nwas a hundred and eighty was three right oh it was three minutes oh you're right\nit's three seconds so you actually are correct my dad so this is three seconds\nso times 22 kilo Hertz you get 17 roughly some 70,000 samples here I'm\ngonna be important some libraries to show you something and then I'm gonna be\nshowing you the first chart so this is the audio signal I have imported right\nnow how does it look like wavy okay cool can you tell me how it sounds that was a\ngood guess the guess was you can tell is actually what's the content right from\nthis diagram because the amplitude of like the the the y-axis here is gonna be\nshowing you just the amplitude can I turn off the light is okay or you're you\nsure okay thank you I really dislike this like okay\ngoodnight Oh see how nice it is okay cool alright so you can't tell anything\nhere right you can't not tell what is the what is\nthe sound right so how can we figure out what is the sound inside here so for\nexample I can show you a transcript over the sound and actually let me let me\nactually force these in your in your your head right so you're gonna have\nhold on your network all right so now we actually heard it\nokay so now you can actually see ting ting ting boom you know you can kind of\nimagine a little bit but okay so what notes did we play there like how can I\nfigure out what put out the notes that they are inside so I'm gonna be showing\nthis one so since this is a bit brighter I can see your faces. How many of you can\nnot read this? Oh, ouch\u2026 Okay, so let me see if I can ask for some help. Maybe someone can help us out here. Okay. Let's see. Hey, hey Alf!\nOh, hi Alf! How's going?\nYeah, yeah, I'm fine, thank you. Nice class there!\nOh, thank you for the class. Oh, nice sweater you too!\nNice sweater! Oh, we're wearing the same sweater! Can you help us out?\nThey don't know how to read the Oh, the connection\u2026\nWhat the f- hell! They cannot read the score!\nCan you help us out, please? Alright!\nLet me try to help you out. Thank you!\nLet me switch the camera. Alright.\nPlease, do. So, here we can go like\u2026 and hear first how it sounds everything. So, it's going to be like that. How cool is that? Thank you. It took four\nlessons for you to clap me. So now\u2026 This is very nice of you. Let's keep\ngoing. A\u266d, then we have an E\u266d, and then a A\u266d. The difference between the first A\u266dand the other one in frequencies is that the first A\u266d is going to be twice the frequency as the other one. And instead, in the middle, we have the 5th.\nWe're going to figure out what is the frequency of that. And then, we are gonna be going to a B\u266d, here. On the left hand side, instead, we have the accompagnement, and so we're gonna have a A\u266d and B\u266d And then B\u266d and E\u266d. So, if we put all together, we gonna get\nthis one. Alright? Simple, no?\nYep! Thank you! Bye-bye!\nByeeeeee! See? This took a whole damn day to\nprepare\u2026 I was so nervous before come here\u2026 I didn't know if it actually would have worked\u2026\nBoth of them, tablet and this one. I'm so happy!\nNow I can actually go to sleep, later. Anyhow, so this was like in the first part you're gonna have the first note\nthere's A\u266d that you have a B\u266d A\u266d and B so you have \u2026 and the and the\ndifference between the first pitch and is one octave there for the first\nfrequency is gonna be twice the second frequency okay so whenever we're gonna\nbe observing the waveform one sign will have to a shorter like the half the\nperiod of the other one right the especially the the a the a flat on top\nis gonna have a period which is half of the period of the a on the bottom one\nright so you have okay if you go half of this one you get right okay okay so how\ndo we actually get these notes out from that spectra from the from the waveform\nwho can tell me how can I extract these pitches these frequencies from the other\nsignal any guess okay a free transform that I think if are kind of a good guess\nwhat does it happen if I perform now a Fourier transform of that signal anyone\ncan actually answer me you cannot raise your hand because I don't see just shout so if you basically perform the Fourier\ntransform of the whole scene are you gonna hear like the whole notes together\nall together right but then you can't figure out which pitch is playing where\nor when actually in this case right ha so we need kind of a Fourier\ntransform which is localized and so a localized Fourier transform in time or\nin space depending on whatever domain you are using its called spectrograph\nright and so on I'm gonna be now printing for you the spectrogram oh\nsorry and I'll be printing here the\nspectrogram of this one here and so here you can compare the two alright on the\nfirst part here on this side here you're gonna have this peak here at 1600 which\nis the the higher power there we go now you have a second one which is this peak\nhere you can see this peak right and you see this peak yeah okay so these Peaks\nare gonna be the actual notes I play with the right hand\nso let's actually put those together and I'm gonna have here the frequencies so I\nhave 1600 1200 and 800 can you see here I have 1600 and 800 Y one is double of\nthe other because they are one octave apart so if this is this gonna be okay\nand this is a fifth which is like a also has a nice interval so then we actually\ngenerate these signals here and then I gotta be concatenate the mouth so I'm\ngonna be playing both these the first one is actually the original audio but let me try again the second one the concatenation yeah so\nit's a bit loud I can now cannot even reduce the volume oh I can reduce it\nhere too much okay let me go again all right\nso this is the concatenation of these four different pitches so guess what we\nare going to be doing next so how can I extract all the notes that I can hear in\na specific given piece so let's say I you play a full score and I'd like to\nknow which pitch is play at what time of what so the answer was convolution just\nfor the recording I'm asking convolution of what no convolutional spectrogram so\nyou have convolution of your input signal with what with some different\nkind of pitches right which pitches will you pick let's say you don't see the\nspectrum because let's say I'm I just play any kind of piece of music so I'd\nlike to know all possible notes they are there what would you do you don't know all pitches how would you\ntry that right so in which are all the pitches you may want to use if you're if\nI'm playing the piano all the keys of the piano right so if I have if I play a\nconcerto with the piano then I want to have like a piece of audio for each of\nthose keys and I'm gonna be running convolutions of my whole piece with the\nold kids right and therefore you're gonna see hits which are the alignment\nof the cosine similarity whenever you get basic\nthe audio matching your specific kernel so I'm gonna be doing this but with\nthese specific tones I actually extract it here so here I'm going to be showing\nyou first how the two spectrograms look like the left side is going to be the\nspectrogram of my actual signal X of T and on the right hand side I have just\nthe spectrogram of this concatenation of my pitches so here you can clearly see\nthis but then here is first of all what are these bars here these vertical bars you follow me right I can see you had to\nactually talk back what are these red bars here vertical bars now it don't\ntell van I already told you right these are and the vertical what what is\nit sampling issues right transitions so whenever you have deep you actually have\none white waveform one waveform and then the other one one away from his to stop\nso it's no longer periodic and whenever you do a Fourier transform of a non\nperiodic signal you get you know crop that's why whenever you get the junk to\nthe junk junction between these the jump here you're gonna have this spike\nbecause it's gonna get basically you can think about the jump is like having a\nvery high frequency right because it's a it's like a delta right so you actually\nget all the frequencies that's why you get all the frequencies here boom okay\nmakes sense right so far kind of alright so this is the green version that I\ncannot even sign and what left side here why is on the left-hand\nside all red down there okay yes you know so the left side left hand\nthe cold are the one I show you on the bottom left side okay so let me finish\nthis class and then I'll let you go so here I'm gonna be convoyed show you\nfirst all the kernels you can tell now the red one is going to be the first\nchunk of my signal they want the real one and then you can see the first pitch\nis gonna be the has the same frequency can you see\nso the problem have the same same same delta T the same interval the same\nperiod can you see you cannot nod your head because again I don't see you had\nto answer me can you see or not okay thank you fantastic and so this one is\nthat the third one you can see that it starts here in the period-- and it\nfinishes here if you go up here you're gonna see exactly there were two of\nthese guys right so that's why you can see that's how you can see this is like\ntwice the frequency of the one below finally I'm gonna be performing the\nconvolution of these four corners with my input signal and this is how we look\nlike okay so the first kernel has a high match in the first part of the of the\nscore so between zero and zero five seconds the second one starts just after\nafter the first one then you have the third one starting at zero three I guess\nand then you have the last one starting at the zero six okay and so\nguess what I'm gonna make you listen to convolutions now are you excited\noh okay you actually answering now good alright and so these are the outcomes\nlet me lower a little the volumes otherwise you complain yeah I can't\nlower the okay so the first one let's try again how cool is that it's just listen to\nconvolution okay so basically this was on shit I have one more slide because I\nfelt like there was some confusion last time about what is the different\ndimensionality of different type of signals so I'm really recommending to go\nand take the class of young Bruna which is math for deep learning and I stole\none of his you know small things he was teaching I just put a one slide here\ntogether for you so this slide is the following so okay so we have the input\nlayer or the samples we provide into this network and so usually our last\ntime I define this I have this curly X which is gonna be made of those x i's\nwhich are all my data same post right and so I usually have em there are\nsamples so my I goes from n 1 to n ok so is this clear on is this notation clear\nbecause it's a bit more formal I use AMA less formal but then somehow someone was\nfeeling a little bit not comfortable I think so this one is just my input\nsamples but we we can also see this one is this curly X which is my input set as\nthe set of all these functions as x i's which are mapping my Omega capital Omega\nwhich is my domain to a RC which are going to be basically my channels of\nthat specific example in so here I'm gonna be mapping those lowercase Omega\nto these x i's of omega so let's see how these different this from the previous\nnotation so I'm gonna give you now three examples and I you should be able to\ntell now what is the dimensionality and is all in this example so the first one\nlet's say I have likely one and show you right now\nin the time just fun piece of you know audio signal so my Omega is going to be\njust the samples like sample number one sample number two like the index right\nso you have index one index to index until these 70,000 whatever we just saw\nright now okay and the last value is going to be the T capital T which is the\nnumber of seconds divided by the delta T which would be the you know 1 over the\nfrequency and this is going to be a subset of n right so this is a discrete\nnumber of samples because you have a computer you always have discrete\nsamples so this is my input data and then what about the image of this\nfunction so when I ask what is the dimensionality of this type of signal\nyou should answer this is a one-dimensional signal because the power\nof these n here is 1 ok so this is like a 1 dimensional signal although you may\nhave the total total time and sorry the 1 there it was a sampling interval on\nthe right hand side you have the number of channels can be 1 if you have a mono\nsignal you can have 2 if you have a stereophonic so you have mono there you\nhave a 2\/4 stereophonic or what is 5 plus 1 that should all be like 5.1 how\ncool alright so this is still a one dimensional signal which may have\nmultiple channels nevertheless is still one dimensional signal because there is\nonly one running variable there ok is it somehow better than last time yes no\nbetter thank you let's say thanks to John alright second\nexample I have here my Omega is going to be the Cartesian product of these two\nsets the first set is going to be going from 1 to the height and also this one\nin discrete and the other one is going to be going from 1 to the width so these\nare the actual pictures and so this one is a 2 dimensional signal because I have\n2 different 2 degrees of freedom in my domain what are the possible channels we\nhave so here the possible channels that are very very common are the following\nso you can have a grayscale image and therefore you only output one\nscrape one scalar value or you get the rainbow there the color and therefore\nyou get like my X which is a function of the coordinates w1 sorry Omega 1 Omega 2\nwhich is not be the each point is represented by a vector of three\ncomponents which is gonna be the R component of the point Omega 1 Omega 2\nthe G component at Omega 1 Omega 2 and the blue component of Omega 1 Omega 2 so\nagain you can all think about this as a big big data point or you can think\nabout this as function mapping a low dimensional domain which is a two\ndimensional domain to a three dimensional domain right finally the\ntwenty who who knows the name of the twenty channel image yeah this is a\nhyper spectral image it's very common to have a better than 20\/20 bandwidth but\nthen sorry finally cooking gas this one my if my my domain is r4 x r4 what can\nit be no no this discrete right\nthis is r4 so it's not even computer ha who said something that I heard yes is\nthis correct so this is space-time what is the second one\nyeah which momentum has a special special name it's called for momentum\nbecause it has a temporal information as well right\nand so what's gonna be my possible image of the X function let's say it's equal 1\nwhat is it do you know so this could be for example the\nHamiltonian of the system okay so this was like a bit more mathematical\nyou know introduction or mathematical procedure how do you say you'll make\nmake a
