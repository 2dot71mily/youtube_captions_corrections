the","start":352.199,"duration":5.271},{"text":"details but I would just like to point","start":354.72,"duration":6.03},{"text":"briefly pointed out so this measure

this","start":424.32,"duration":4.44},{"text":"complexity is low then this term is","start":426.24,"duration":5.43},{"text":"great and if this complexity is

the","start":527.1,"duration":5.1},{"text":"beautiful thing is that this framework","start":530.61,"duration":3.39},{"text":"is so general some people would

the","start":1274.509,"duration":3.601},{"text":"other is that none of the information","start":1276.759,"duration":4.65},{"text":"that's exchanged when clinicians

of","start":1369.67,"duration":5.04},{"text":"two things that are driving the patient","start":1372.64,"duration":4.5},{"text":"experience in hospital the first is how","start":1374.71,"duration":4.53},{"text":"do we identify which patients are at","start":1377.14,"duration":4.05},{"text":"risk of deterioration at any moment and","start":1379.24,"duration":4.05},{"text":"there's two or three sources of data","start":1381.19,"duration":3.87},{"text":"here there's the stuff that already","start":1383.29,"duration":4.44},{"text":"exists on the very clunky and painful","start":1385.06,"duration":5.61},{"text":"and old-school digital systems as well","start":1387.73,"duration":4.8},{"text":"as the paper-based record and I think","start":1390.67,"duration":3.87},{"text":"you'll be very surprising to most people","start":1392.53,"duration":4.11},{"text":"although not many of the junior doctors","start":1394.54,"duration":4.08},{"text":"and consultants and nurses who work in","start":1396.64,"duration":4.41},{"text":"the systems just to to realize that","start":1398.62,"duration":4.05},{"text":"actually a lot of these systems these","start":1401.05,"duration":3.63},{"text":"desktop-based old-school systems that","start":1402.67,"duration":3.48},{"text":"are in deployment at the moment were","start":1404.68,"duration":3.48},{"text":"actually developed for completely","start":1406.15,"duration":4.53},{"text":"different ecosystems so firstly largely","start":1408.16,"duration":5.28},{"text":"in the US and secondly often originally","start":1410.68,"duration":4.62},{"text":"those systems were built for logistics","start":1413.44,"duration":4.26},{"text":"or accounting so not really designed for","start":1415.3,"duration":4.29},{"text":"healthcare from the ground up thinking","start":1417.7,"duration":3.47},{"text":"about the user need all the way through","start":1419.59,"duration":4.26},{"text":"and so the first job is to take","start":1421.17,"duration":4.33},{"text":"advantage of all the data that currently","start":1423.85,"duration":4.14},{"text":"exists both both that which is digitized","start":1425.5,"duration":4.26},{"text":"and that which needs to be digitized and","start":1427.99,"duration":4.44},{"text":"then secondly use that to escalate

of","start":1442.12,"duration":4.53},{"text":"what a truly digitized healthcare","start":1444.37,"duration":4.86},{"text":"experience might actually look like here","start":1446.65,"duration":4.86},{"text":"we have our patient Robert who was","start":1449.23,"duration":5.01},{"text":"admitted yesterday with a complaint of a","start":1451.51,"duration":5.79},{"text":"severe abdominal pain and so he was kept","start":1454.24,"duration":5.01},{"text":"in overnight for observations and

simple","start":1465.7,"duration":3.96},{"text":"he's able to swipe across update the","start":1467.44,"duration":4.35},{"text":"number and immediately we see that

worked","start":266.17,"duration":2.63},{"text":"with teams in Google Brain\nto build models to control","start":268.8,"duration":4.17},{"text":"the cooling

TensorFlow,","start":281.527,"duration":1.833},{"text":"and they're getting\nhot doing so.","start":283.36,"duration":1.72},{"text":"So we have these fans\nat the back, which","start":285.08,"duration":2.17},{"text":"pull that cold air\nover the servers","start":287.25,"duration":1.68},{"text":"into this hot aisle, where it\ntravels down and is transferred","start":288.93,"duration":3.72},{"text":"into a water cooling system.","start":292.65,"duration":2.35},{"text":"So here are some\npipes and some pumps.","start":295.0,"duration":2.24},{"text":"And the pipes take the hot\nwater from the hot aisle","start":297.24,"duration":2.73},{"text":"to the chillers on the roof,\nand the cold water from those","start":299.97,"duration":2.58},{"text":"chillers back to the cold aisle.","start":302.55,"duration":2.482},{"text":"And here's what those\ncooling towers look like.","start":305.032,"duration":1.958},{"text":"They're just big fans\nwhich take the water","start":306.99,"duration":2.07},{"text":"and cool it down into the air.","start":309.06,"duration":3.48},{"text":"So we spent a while\nworking on this offline.","start":312.54,"duration":2.31},{"text":"We had to take into\naccount safety.","start":314.85,"duration":3.36},{"text":"The model couldn't go\nand try random things,","start":318.21,"duration":3.78},{"text":"otherwise we'd break\nbillion-dollar data centers,","start":321.99,"duration":2.34},{"text":"which is never great.","start":324.33,"duration":1.69},{"text":"And we had to work out how\nto do a bit of exploration","start":326.02,"duration":2.6},{"text":"as well, because if we\njust learned on the data","start":328.62,"duration":2.37},{"text":"which we had available,\nthe model would probably","start":330.99,"duration":3.026},{"text":"never learn to do\nanything more optimal","start":334.016,"duration":1.624},{"text":"than what the human\noperators had done.","start":335.64,"duration":4.77},{"text":"So we iterated a bit,\nand when it eventually","start":340.41,"duration":2.16},{"text":"came time to experiment,\nwe turned it on,","start":342.57,"duration":1.95},{"text":"and we saw this nice drop.","start":344.52,"duration":2.16},{"text":">From my experience, it's\nkind of rare to see

it.","start":351.06,"duration":1.26},{"text":"So we had this initial\nresult, and it came time","start":355.5,"duration":3.03},{"text":"to implement it.","start":358.53,"duration":1.11},{"text":"Because the data\ncenters didn't really","start":359.64,"duration":2.49},{"text":"have the infrastructure\nset up to run, and train,","start":362.13,"duration":4.59},{"text":"and evaluate, and verify\nmachine learning models,","start":366.72,"duration":2.94},{"text":"we had to write a lot\nof this ourselves.","start":369.66,"duration":3.48},{"text":"So we did that.","start":373.14,"duration":0.72},{"text":"We took our original\nTorch models","start":373.86,"duration":1.62},{"text":"and moved them to TensorFlow.","start":375.48,"duration":1.26},{"text":"We built up all this\ntraining, and validation,","start":376.74,"duration":2.16},{"text":"and serving

kind","start":395.55,"duration":2.0},{"text":"of infrastructure stuff.","start":397.55,"duration":1.4},{"text":"Cool.","start":401.974,"duration":2.178},{"text":"So another example\nwhere TensorFlow","start":404.152,"duration":1.458},{"text":"helped us is we\npreviously had this system","start":405.61,"duration":1.98},{"text":"called Gorila, which stands for\ngeneral reinforcement learning","start":407.59,"duration":3.72},{"text":"architecture, with some extra\nletters thrown in there.","start":411.31,"duration":2.992},{"text":"And we wrote this,\ninitially, to speed up","start":417.04,"duration":1.86},{"text":"training of DQN style agents.","start":418.9,"duration":2.73},{"text":"So what this was was a framework\nbuilt on top of disbelief.","start":421.63,"duration":5.31},{"text":"We had the parameters\nof an agent stored","start":426.94,"duration":2.85},{"text":"across multiple\nparameter

server","start":433.389,"duration":2.041},{"text":"and interacting with\nenvironments to get experience.","start":435.43,"duration":3.21},{"text":"That experience was then stored\nin a distributed

parameters.","start":446.431,"duration":0.999},{"text":"And the whole thing kind\nof cycled around like that.","start":447.43,"duration":2.867},{"text":"By doing it this way, we\ncould get more experience","start":450.297,"duration":2.083},{"text":"faster because we\nhad multiple agents,","start":452.38,"duration":1.83},{"text":"and we could learn\nfaster because we","start":454.21,"duration":1.5},{"text":"had multiple learners.","start":455.71,"duration":2.32},{"text":"But often, more than the\nspeed of convergence,","start":458.03,"duration":1.999},{"text":"we often saw that sometimes\nthese models actually","start":460.029,"duration":2.041},{"text":"did better than models\ntrained on single servers.","start":462.07,"duration":3.739},{"text":"And we think that\nhad something to do","start":465.809,"duration":1.541},{"text":"with the breaking\nof correlations","start":467.35,"duration":2.4},{"text":"between the examples we\ntrained on from time to time.","start":469.75,"duration":3.72},{"text":"This also was one\nof the

later","start":475.27,"duration":2.7},{"text":"developed.","start":477.97,"duration":2.81},{"text":"So with the introduction\nof TensorFlow,","start":480.78,"duration":1.98},{"text":"we were able to\nbasically deprecate this","start":482.76,"duration":1.806},{"text":"because much of\nthe functionality","start":484.566,"duration":1.374},{"text":"is handled by\nTensorFlow or can be","start":485.94,"duration":1.95},{"text":"written from within\nTensorFlow, which is great","start":487.89,"duration":3.51},{"text":"because it's less time\nwe need to spend on

projects.","start":496.32,"duration":3.8},{"text":"More generally, since we've\nstarted using TensorFlow,","start":500.12,"duration":2.26},{"text":"we've seen a reduction\nacross the board","start":502.38,"duration":1.95},{"text":"in the amount of ancillary\nwork we have to perform.","start":504.33,"duration":3.06},{"text":"And things are only getting\nbetter as TensorFlow","start":507.39,"duration":2.0},{"text":"and the ecosystem around\nit continues to develop.","start":509.39,"duration":3.519},{"text":"So one of these is\nthe high-level

nice.","start":551.67,"duration":2.48},{"text":"The distributed\ntraining helps us.","start":554.15,"duration":2.79},{"text":"We can try more things\nquicker and sooner.","start":556.94,"duration":4.097},{"text":"And finally, once we've\ngone through all this work","start":561.037,"duration":2.083},{"text":"and we're excited and wanting\nto put them all into

that.","start":363.04,"duration":1.8},{"text":"And what we've been\nvery committed to do","start":364.84,"duration":1.92},{"text":"is to try to train\nan algorithm to learn","start":366.76,"duration":2.29},{"text":"its own representation\nof the world","start":369.05,"duration":2.15},{"text":"through interaction\nwith some environment.","start":371.2,"duration":2.96},{"text":"So all of our systems begin\nwith the training of a machine","start":374.16,"duration":2.92},{"text":"learning system, or an agent.","start":377.08,"duration":1.93},{"text":"That agent has some goal, which\nis defined by the human being,","start":379.01,"duration":4.03},{"text":"and it's able to interact\nwith some

terms.","start":386.36,"duration":1.04},{"text":"It could be a robotic system\ninteracting with a kitchen","start":387.4,"duration":3.37},{"text":"or a car manufacturing plant.","start":390.77,"duration":2.376},{"text":"It could be YouTube,\nwhere the environment is","start":393.146,"duration":1.874},{"text":"to try to recommend\nvideos that people watch,","start":395.02,"duration":2.88},{"text":"or it could be an energy grid.","start":397.9,"duration":2.19},{"text":"And that agent is able\nto take a set of

YouTube","start":405.66,"duration":1.97},{"text":"or controlling a robotic arm.","start":407.63,"duration":2.09},{"text":"And then the environment passes\nback a set of state updates.","start":409.72,"duration":4.21},{"text":"So after the interaction\nwith the environment,","start":413.93,"duration":2.93},{"text":"the environment has\nsomehow changed.","start":416.86,"duration":1.87},{"text":"And so all the sensors\nthat collect information","start":418.73,"duration":2.2},{"text":"about that environment send\nthe updated observations","start":420.93,"duration":2.69},{"text":"back to the agent.","start":423.62,"duration":1.08},{"text":"And it's through this\nprocess of interaction","start":424.7,"duration":2.6},{"text":"through reinforcement\nlearning, we're","start":427.3,"duration":1.62},{"text":"able to train agents to learn\ntheir own representation","start":428.92,"duration":2.86},{"text":"of what it takes to\noptimize some goal.","start":431.78,"duration":4.04},{"text":"And right in the\nbeginning, we were","start":435.82,"duration":1.87},{"text":"very successful in\ntraining our algorithms","start":437.69,"duration":1.93},{"text":"on the old-school Atari testbed.","start":439.62,"duration":1.57},{"text":"So many of you will\nbe familiar with this.","start":441.19,"duration":1.75},{"text":"It's like 100 or so Atari\ngames from the '70s and '80s.","start":442.94,"duration":3.88},{"text":"And the environment is\nsimply a set of raw pixels.","start":446.82,"duration":3.28},{"text":"So at every frame, we're\npassing back a set of RGB,","start":450.1,"duration":4.1},{"text":"or red, green, blue\nvalues, to the algorithm","start":454.2,"duration":3.1},{"text":"based on where that sits in\na frame, on an x and y-axis.","start":457.3,"duration":6.64},{"text":"And so really there's no\npre-programmed knowledge.","start":463.94,"duration":2.46},{"text":"Everything is\nlearned from scratch.","start":466.4,"duration":1.6},{"text":"So we're not hand coding any\ninsight into the algorithm.","start":468.0,"duration":3.95},{"text":"We're not saying, this\nis what a color is","start":471.95,"duration":1.96},{"text":"or this is what motion\nand dynamics are,","start":473.91,"duration":1.9},{"text":"or this is a paddle,\nthis is an enemy.","start":475.81,"duration":2.23},{"text":"We're really saying\ngiven this set of pixels,","start":478.04,"duration":2.6},{"text":"over time can you optimize\nyour goal function,","start":480.64,"duration":3.94},{"text":"which is to get more reward,\nby tweaking the action buttons?","start":484.58,"duration":4.11},{"text":"And so that is really\nall we give to the agent.","start":488.69,"duration":2.35},{"text":"We just wire them up\nto the action buttons","start":491.04,"duration":2.42},{"text":"and give them the motivation of\ntrying to optimize for score.","start":493.46,"duration":2.59},{"text":"So really the best intuition is\nto think about a robot standing","start":496.05,"duration":3.54},{"text":"in an arcade being fed the\npixels from the video screen","start":499.59,"duration":3.9},{"text":"and fiddling around with the\njoystick and the fire button","start":503.49,"duration":3.02},{"text":"in order to find out\nwhat the association is","start":506.51,"duration":3.41},{"text":"between the set of actions it's\nable to take, the set of pixels","start":509.92,"duration":3.239},{"text":"that it saw in the\nlast few frames,","start":513.159,"duration":2.221},{"text":"and the reward that it gets.","start":515.38,"duration":1.175},{"text":"It's kind of just simple\nassociative learning","start":516.555,"duration":1.874},{"text":"at one level.","start":518.429,"duration":2.151},{"text":"So let me give you a sense\nfor what this looks like.","start":520.58,"duration":2.44},{"text":"This is the old\ngame of Breakout.","start":523.02,"duration":2.33},{"text":"And here we are after\n100 games, the agent's","start":525.35,"duration":2.09},{"text":"just arrived in the environment.","start":527.44,"duration":1.63},{"text":"So it really has\nno idea what to do.","start":529.07,"duration":1.81},{"text":"It's sort of moving\naround left and right,","start":530.88,"duration":1.93},{"text":"trying to explore the\nspace and randomly discover","start":532.81,"duration":3.97},{"text":"what kind of actions\nseem to be rewarding.","start":536.78,"duration":2.7},{"text":"After 300 games,\nit seems to have","start":539.48,"duration":2.18},{"text":"learned pretty well that\nthere's a strong association","start":541.66,"duration":2.799},{"text":"between moving the bat\ninto the right place","start":544.459,"duration":1.791},{"text":"to hit the ball back\nat the right time.","start":546.25,"duration":2.41},{"text":"And this is pretty\nmuch human performance.","start":548.66,"duration":1.98},{"text":"This is better than I can play.","start":550.64,"duration":2.23},{"text":"But interestingly, we left\nit training for 500 games","start":552.87,"duration":3.252},{"text":"overnight, and it developed\nthis really cool strategy","start":556.122,"duration":2.208},{"text":"where it tunnels the\nball up the sides","start":558.33,"duration":2.47},{"text":"to get maximum points\nwith minimum effort.","start":560.8,"duration":2.46},{"text":"And this was super\nsurprising to us","start":563.26,"duration":2.02},{"text":"as engineers because it was\nreally cool in some sense","start":565.28,"duration":3.72},{"text":"because many humans don't\nrealize that strategy when","start":569.0,"duration":2.41},{"text":"playing the game,\nand it was something","start":571.41,"duration":1.75},{"text":"that emerged through\nthe agent interacting","start":573.16,"duration":3.54},{"text":"with the game on its own.","start":576.7,"duration":1.6},{"text":"So it's really surprising\nto see the first signs,","start":578.3,"duration":2.32},{"text":"the complex behaviors,\nrelatively complex behaviors,","start":580.62,"duration":3.49},{"text":"can emerge without us\nhand-crafting those features","start":584.11,"duration":2.431},{"text":"in.","start":586.541,"duration":0.499},{"text":"So this was really\nexciting to us two","start":587.04,"duration":2.19},{"text":"and a half, three years ago.","start":589.23,"duration":2.39},{"text":"Another example is the\ngame of Space Invaders.","start":591.62,"duration":2.98},{"text":"And so this is a video\nof before training.","start":594.6,"duration":2.73},{"text":"You can see that it's getting\nkilled all of the time.","start":597.33,"duration":3.24},{"text":"It's sort of randomly\nfiring around.","start":600.57,"duration":1.71},{"text":"It doesn't realize that\nthose things are denying it,","start":602.28,"duration":2.48},{"text":"when it gets hit by\none of those

bunch","start":613.724,"duration":1.916},{"text":"of really interesting dynamics.","start":615.64,"duration":1.389},{"text":"So first of all,\nyou can see it often","start":617.029,"duration":1.541},{"text":"hiding behind the orange\nobstacle, because it knows","start":618.57,"duration":2.71},{"text":"that if it gets hit by\none of those missiles","start":621.28,"duration":2.05},{"text":"it's in big trouble.","start":623.33,"duration":1.49},{"text":"Secondly, you can see\nthat it's actually","start":624.82,"duration":1.89},{"text":"often aiming at the top.","start":626.71,"duration":1.137},{"text":"So it's trying to\nget those ones first","start":627.847,"duration":1.583},{"text":"because it gets more reward.","start":629.43,"duration":1.166},{"text":"Here, we see the\npink mothership.","start":630.596,"duration":1.494},{"text":"And it does an incredible\npredictive shot","start":632.09,"duration":1.86},{"text":"to try and get that because it\ngets more reward for hitting","start":633.95,"duration":3.77},{"text":"that at the right time.","start":637.72,"duration":1.759},{"text":"And the other thing is you can\nsee that it very rarely

19","start":698.64,"duration":3.59},{"text":"by 19 board.","start":702.23,"duration":1.32},{"text":"And if you're white, I'm black.","start":703.55,"duration":2.36},{"text":"And the objective is to\ntry and place stones such","start":705.91,"duration":2.15},{"text":"that you surround your\nopponent's territory.","start":708.06,"duration":2.51},{"text":"So there's really no\nfurther rules than that.","start":710.57,"duration":2.17},{"text":"It's very unstructured.","start":712.74,"duration":2.01},{"text":"It's very abstract.","start":714.75,"duration":1.69},{"text":"And there are no\nsort of tricks that","start":716.44,"duration":1.54},{"text":"help you to exploit\nstructure in the space.","start":717.98,"duration":3.53},{"text":"So in chess, for\nexample, all the pieces","start":721.51,"duration":1.94},{"text":"are worth different\namounts, and so you","start":723.45,"duration":2.05},{"text":"can focus all your energy\non protecting your

space","start":739.34,"duration":1.92},{"text":"is really absolutely enormous.","start":741.26,"duration":2.05},{"text":"It's a 3,000-year-old game.","start":743.31,"duration":1.45},{"text":"And believe it or not,\nit's incredibly popular","start":744.76,"duration":3.429},{"text":"all over the world.","start":748.189,"duration":0.791},{"text":"There are 40 million\nplayers

play","start":753.65,"duration":1.69},{"text":"is that there are 10 to the\npower of 170 possible state","start":755.34,"duration":3.93},{"text":"spaces on a 19 by 19 board.","start":759.27,"duration":3.08},{"text":"So just to give a sense\nof what this means,","start":762.35,"duration":2.4},{"text":"it's a 10 with 170\nzeros on to describe","start":764.75,"duration":3.07},{"text":"the number of possible\nboard configurations","start":767.82,"duration":3.26},{"text":"that are possible in the game.","start":771.08,"duration":3.72},{"text":"And it's been estimated that\nthere are something like 10","start":774.8,"duration":3.24},{"text":"to the 70, so 10 with 70 zeros\nafter it, atoms in the known","start":778.04,"duration":5.44},{"text":"universe.","start":783.48,"duration":0.66},{"text":"In every liquid, solid, and\ngas in the known

number","start":796.18,"duration":2.77},{"text":"to intuit and get\nyour head around.","start":798.95,"duration":2.092},{"text":"This is roughly what\nthe branching

space.","start":807.58,"duration":1.486},{"text":"And so here there\nare something like 10","start":809.066,"duration":1.624},{"text":"to the power of 40\npossible board positions.","start":810.69,"duration":3.45},{"text":"And so for every\npossible move, there","start":814.14,"duration":2.39},{"text":"arise another set of\nmoves that are possible,","start":816.53,"duration":1.96},{"text":"and then another\nset, and another set.","start":818.49,"duration":1.87},{"text":"And this branches out for\nabout 100 or so, and that","start":820.36,"duration":2.78},{"text":"roughly makes up 10\nto the power of 40","start":823.14,"duration":2.17},{"text":"or so possible board positions.","start":825.31,"duration":2.72},{"text":"But this is what it\nlooks like for there","start":828.03,"duration":2.25},{"text":"to be 10 to the power of 170\npossible board

move.","start":837.32,"duration":2.3},{"text":"And so trying to model structure\nin a space that is so large","start":839.62,"duration":4.07},{"text":"is really very, very difficult.\nWriting an evaluation function","start":843.69,"duration":3.38},{"text":"to know if you're in a strong\nposition or a weak position","start":847.07,"duration":2.46},{"text":"is incredibly hard.","start":849.53,"duration":1.18},{"text":"And so all of the top players\nessentially rely on intuition.","start":850.71,"duration":4.844},{"text":"And that branching\nfactor that you","start":855.554,"duration":1.416},{"text":"see there goes on for\n200 possible branches","start":856.97,"duration":3.18},{"text":"until you reach the\nend of the game.","start":860.15,"duration":3.07},{"text":"So we trained two\ndifferent neural networks","start":863.22,"duration":2.99},{"text":"that learn a representation of\nwhat is effective in the space.","start":866.21,"duration":3.16},{"text":"The first is to basically say,\ngiven a set of possible moves","start":869.37,"duration":4.87},{"text":"that might be valuable at\nthis particular position,","start":874.24,"duration":3.04},{"text":"how do I identify which\none I should take.","start":877.28,"duration":2.0},{"text":"So here what we see is\nthat, the green layer,","start":879.28,"duration":2.49},{"text":"there's 10 different positions\nthat have been identified.","start":881.77,"duration":2.79},{"text":"And that network has been\ntrained on past games,","start":884.56,"duration":2.97},{"text":"100,000 or so past games.","start":887.53,"duration":2.39},{"text":"So we're learning from the\nvery best of human knowledge","start":889.92,"duration":4.39},{"text":"to bootstrap our\nalgorithm to start","start":894.31,"duration":2.42},{"text":"from at least the best that\nhuman knowledge has to provide.","start":896.73,"duration":2.74},{"text":"And once a particular\nposition has been identified,","start":899.47,"duration":4.4},{"text":"the algorithm then trains\na different network","start":903.87,"duration":2.4},{"text":"to search the value of\nthat particular position.","start":906.27,"duration":3.31},{"text":"And so we're trying\nto figure out","start":909.58,"duration":1.6},{"text":"the probability of\nwinning if we roll forward","start":911.18,"duration":2.9},{"text":"from this kind of position.","start":914.08,"duration":2.89},{"text":"And so both of these networks\nwork in tandem with one","start":916.97,"duration":2.41},{"text":"another to make a guess at\nwhich movie should be taken.","start":919.38,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Earlier this year, we played\nthe world champion, Lee Sedol,","start":925.11,"duration":4.26},{"text":"over in Seoul in Korea for\na $1 million live

exciting.","start":947.48,"duration":2.29},{"text":"We won four to one.","start":949.77,"duration":1.13},{"text":"And widely recognized to be a\ndecade earlier than expected.","start":950.9,"duration":4.56},{"text":"And it created an\nincredible buzz.","start":955.46,"duration":2.43},{"text":"So there were 280\nmillion live

surreal","start":961.77,"duration":2.98},{"text":"given each game is about\nfour or five hours long.","start":964.75,"duration":4.39},{"text":"So it's of intense.","start":969.14,"duration":2.14},{"text":"35,000 press articles.","start":971.28,"duration":1.54},{"text":"So, incredibly, it\ncaused a shortage","start":972.82,"duration":1.68},{"text":"of the sale of Go boards, which\nwas also quite remarkable when","start":974.5,"duration":3.17},{"text":"you consider they're\nkind of bits of wood","start":977.67,"duration":1.93},{"text":"with some stones on top.","start":979.6,"duration":1.19},{"text":"So we're really excited\nabout the buzz and energy","start":980.79,"duration":2.56},{"text":"that it created.","start":983.35,"duration":0.93},{"text":"And, again, we were\nlucky enough to manage","start":984.28,"duration":2.61},{"text":"to get a Nature\npaper and, of

work.","start":994.42,"duration":4.12},{"text":"But, of course,\nour real motivation","start":998.54,"duration":2.55},{"text":"is to develop these systems\nso that we can actually","start":1001.09,"duration":2.6},{"text":"make progress on some of our\nmost intractable problems.","start":1003.69,"duration":2.42},{"text":"That's what motivates\nus at

ways","start":1009.29,"duration":1.624},{"text":"is what makes our\norganization so exceptional.","start":1010.914,"duration":2.516},{"text":"I think the really smartest\npeople in the

people.","start":1018.58,"duration":1.5},{"text":"But I think what's\nalso really important","start":1020.08,"duration":1.99},{"text":"and becoming really clear I\nthink in the last five years","start":1022.07,"duration":2.46},{"text":"at least is that those\npeople have the freedom","start":1024.53,"duration":2.65},{"text":"to work on any\nproblem in the world.","start":1027.18,"duration":1.55},{"text":"They can go to any\nlab or to any company,","start":1028.73,"duration":3.088},{"text":"they can take their

world,","start":1035.2,"duration":2.7},{"text":"and know that you are\nactually working hard","start":1037.9,"duration":2.199},{"text":"to try to change the model\nof running an

structures","start":1046.16,"duration":2.42},{"text":"and do things quite differently.","start":1048.58,"duration":2.16},{"text":"So we took the same\nkind of methods","start":1050.74,"duration":1.67},{"text":"and we actually\ndeployed them to see","start":1052.41,"duration":1.5},{"text":"if we could make Google's data\ncenters much more efficient.","start":1053.91,"duration":3.446},{"text":"And what we did, so\nwe trained a model","start":1057.356,"duration":2.584},{"text":"to look at all the past\nretrospective sensor","start":1059.94,"duration":2.67},{"text":"data that describes how\nthe data center operates.","start":1062.61,"duration":4.67},{"text":"And this includes data,\nthings like air pressure","start":1067.28,"duration":3.94},{"text":"and temperature, incoming server\nload, and so on and so forth.","start":1071.22,"duration":4.06},{"text":"And what we're able\nto do is train a model","start":1075.28,"duration":1.75},{"text":"to use power more\nefficiently to deliver","start":1077.03,"duration":3.94},{"text":"exactly the same performance.","start":1080.97,"duration":1.74},{"text":"So there were no\nglitches I hope in any","start":1082.71,"duration":2.04},{"text":"of your experience of watching\nYouTube or any of your search","start":1084.75,"duration":3.08},{"text":"results.","start":1087.83,"duration":0.73},{"text":"But all the while, we\nmanaged to deliver exactly","start":1088.56,"duration":2.0},{"text":"the

this is quite exciting\nbecause it gives us a hint","start":1097.18,"duration":3.13},{"text":"that these kinds of very\nlarge learning methods","start":1100.31,"duration":4.02},{"text":"can be used for very\nhard real-world problems.","start":1104.33,"duration":2.91},{"text":"And I think one of the things\nwe're really excited about now","start":1107.24,"duration":2.5},{"text":"is how we might\nbe able to deploy","start":1109.74,"duration":1.374},{"text":"these very general\nalgorithms for load balancing","start":1111.114,"duration":2.946},{"text":"on the national

space","start":1117.02,"duration":2.91},{"text":"and the real-world data\nis really, really noisy.","start":1119.93,"duration":2.747},{"text":"And what we really need\nto do is design

systems.","start":1128.29,"duration":2.47},{"text":"And so, ultimately, what we're\nexcited about is the potential","start":1130.76,"duration":3.27},{"text":"to use these same\nsystems in any building","start":1134.03,"duration":3.34},{"text":"to predict incoming load and\nadjust the energy required","start":1137.37,"duration":3.74},{"text":"to operate that piece of\ninfrastructure

thing","start":1182.2,"duration":1.92},{"text":"that we discovered is\nthat there is actually","start":1184.12,"duration":2.32},{"text":"an incredible amount\nof really rich data","start":1186.44,"duration":2.32},{"text":"that describes your\nexperience when","start":1188.76,"duration":1.78},{"text":"you're admitted in a

the challenge\nis that it sits","start":1196.2,"duration":1.51},{"text":"in charts like this at\nthe bottom of your bed.","start":1197.71,"duration":3.0},{"text":"And so this is, for\nexample, a fluid

facing.","start":1341.83,"duration":1.96},{"text":"And actually a really\ninteresting study","start":1343.79,"duration":2.24},{"text":"came out earlier this\nyear from the BMJ","start":1346.03,"duration":3.39},{"text":"that has estimated that\nmedical error is actually","start":1349.42,"duration":2.1},{"text":"the third leading cause\nof death in the US.","start":1351.52,"duration":2.82},{"text":"And so everybody thinks\nthat the numbers in the UK","start":1354.34,"duration":2.89},{"text":"are very, very underestimated.","start":1357.23,"duration":4.03},{"text":"Something like 250,000 people\ndie a year preventatively","start":1361.26,"duration":5.08},{"text":"because of medical\nerror in the US.","start":1366.34,"duration":2.88},{"text":"It's the third biggest killer.","start":1369.22,"duration":2.31},{"text":"And so largely\nthere's two things","start":1371.53,"duration":1.89},{"text":"that are driving the patient\nexperience in hospital.","start":1373.42,"duration":2.6},{"text":"The first is how do we identify\nwhich patients are at risk","start":1376.02,"duration":3.6},{"text":"of deterioration at any moment.","start":1379.62,"duration":1.74},{"text":"And there's two or three\nsources of data here.","start":1381.36,"duration":2.36},{"text":"There's the stuff\nthat already exists","start":1383.72,"duration":2.11},{"text":"on the very clunky and painful\nand old school digital systems,","start":1385.83,"duration":4.56},{"text":"as well as the\npaper-based record.","start":1390.39,"duration":1.889},{"text":"And I think it would be very\nsurprising to most people,","start":1392.279,"duration":2.291},{"text":"although not to many\nof the junior doctors","start":1394.57,"duration":2.23},{"text":"and consultants and nurses\nwho work in the systems,","start":1396.8,"duration":2.37},{"text":"to realize that actually\na lot of these systems,","start":1399.17,"duration":3.38},{"text":"these desktop-based old school\nsystems that are in deployment","start":1402.55,"duration":2.84},{"text":"at the moment, were actually\ndeveloped for completely","start":1405.39,"duration":2.76},{"text":"different ecosystems.","start":1408.15,"duration":1.22},{"text":"So firstly, largely in the US.","start":1409.37,"duration":2.28},{"text":"And secondly, often\noriginally those systems","start":1411.65,"duration":2.54},{"text":"were built for\nlogistics or accounting.","start":1414.19,"duration":1.95},{"text":"So not really designed for\nhealth care from the ground up,","start":1416.14,"duration":3.06},{"text":"thinking about the user\nneed all the way through.","start":1419.2,"duration":2.94},{"text":"And so the first job is to\ntake advantage of all the data","start":1422.14,"duration":2.86},{"text":"that currently exists, both\nthat which is digitized","start":1425.0,"duration":3.14},{"text":"and that which needs\nto be digitized.","start":1428.14,"duration":2.09},{"text":"And then secondly, use that to\nescalate care more effectively.","start":1430.23,"duration":3.18},{"text":"So once you've\nidentified which patients","start":1433.41,"duration":1.84},{"text":"are at risk of deterioration\nby looking at all the data,","start":1435.25,"duration":2.77},{"text":"how do you manage\nthe coordination","start":1438.02,"duration":1.48},{"text":"of that intervention\nmore effectively.","start":1439.5,"duration":3.03},{"text":"And so let me take you\nthrough an example of what","start":1442.53,"duration":2.29},{"text":"a truly digitized health care\nexperience might actually","start":1444.82,"duration":3.01},{"text":"look like.","start":1447.83,"duration":1.24},{"text":"Here we have our\npatient, Robert,","start":1449.07,"duration":1.55},{"text":"who was admitted\nyesterday with a complaint","start":1450.62,"duration":3.39},{"text":"of a severe abdominal pain.","start":1454.01,"duration":2.46},{"text":"And so he was kept in\novernight for observations.","start":1456.47,"duration":2.58},{"text":"And our ward nurse, Jamie,\nis taking his temperature.","start":1459.05,"duration":3.05},{"text":"He's able to record\nthe temperature","start":1462.1,"duration":2.17},{"text":"on his mobile phone,\non his iPhone.","start":1464.27,"duration":2.111},{"text":"And it's really pretty simple.","start":1466.381,"duration":1.249},{"text":"He's able to swipe\nacross, update the number,","start":1467.63,"duration":2.67},{"text":"and immediately we see that\nthe temperature is actually","start":1470.3,"duration":2.79},{"text":"39.2 degrees.","start":1473.09,"duration":2.02},{"text":"And so this is obviously\nsuper concerning.","start":1475.11,"duration":1.81},{"text":"And it's generated what's called\nan Early Warning Score, which","start":1476.92,"duration":3.11},{"text":"immediately triggers an\nalert to the doctor on call.","start":1480.03,"duration":4.51},{"text":"She is able to read that\ninformation in the lift","start":1484.54,"duration":2.75},{"text":"and immediately realize that\nactually this patient needs","start":1487.29,"duration":2.96},{"text":"to be seen by me\nvery, very quickly.","start":1490.25,"duration":2.21},{"text":"She scrubs through\non her mobile phone","start":1492.46,"duration":1.78},{"text":"and looks up the\nname of the patient.","start":1494.24,"duration":1.88},{"text":"So there's structured search\nacross all of the key features","start":1496.12,"duration":2.954},{"text":"in the hospital.","start":1499.074,"duration":0.666},{"text":"She can search by consultant,\nby ward, by specialty,","start":1499.74,"duration":5.26},{"text":"she can search my medical\nrecord number or date of birth.","start":1505.0,"duration":3.039},{"text":"And here she's typing in\nthe name of the patient.","start":1508.039,"duration":2.041},{"text":"So she can pull up Robert\nJones and immediately view","start":1510.08,"duration":2.74},{"text":"his profile.","start":1512.82,"duration":0.83},{"text":"So this for the\nfirst time aggregates","start":1513.65,"duration":2.51},{"text":"all of the data that is being\ncollected across the hospital","start":1516.16,"duration":2.52},{"text":"system from the\npatient's perspective.","start":1518.68,"duration":2.69},{"text":"And so what she's presented\nwith immediately is an overview.","start":1521.37,"duration":3.63},{"text":"What is this\npatient's allergies?","start":1525.0,"duration":1.77},{"text":"Why have they been admitted\nin this current episode?","start":1526.77,"duration":2.81},{"text":"What are their\nunderlying diagnosis?","start":1529.58,"duration":1.65},{"text":"She can see here that this\npatient's had tonsillitis, also","start":1531.23,"duration":3.63},{"text":"suffers from asthma, in the\npast had a tonsilectomy.","start":1534.86,"duration":3.57},{"text":"She can scrub down and see\nwhat medication they're on","start":1538.43,"duration":2.69},{"text":"and she can see all\nof the observations","start":1541.12,"duration":1.79},{"text":"and any other details that are\nrelevant and most immediately","start":1542.91,"duration":2.9},{"text":"necessary in the overview.","start":1545.81,"duration":1.68},{"text":"If she swipes across, she can\nsee a different stream of data.","start":1547.49,"duration":3.74},{"text":"She can see the linear\ntimeline of everything","start":1551.23,"duration":2.52},{"text":"that's happened to\nthis patient in order.","start":1553.75,"duration":2.272},{"text":"So in the last few\nminutes, she can","start":1556.022,"duration":1.458},{"text":"see that this patient's actually\ntriggered a sepsis alert.","start":1557.48,"duration":2.805},{"text":"It looks like they\nmay be at risk","start":1560.285,"duration":1.375},{"text":"of a very serious infection.","start":1561.66,"duration":1.684},{"text":"They've got an\nacute kidney injury","start":1563.344,"duration":1.416},{"text":"alert, which means\nthat they're probably","start":1564.76,"duration":1.666},{"text":"dehydrated in their kidneys\nor are at great risk.","start":1566.426,"duration":2.864},{"text":"We can see that they've\nbeen sent for bloods.","start":1569.29,"duration":2.08},{"text":"The bloods have been ordered\nand they've been taken,","start":1571.37,"duration":1.81},{"text":"but they've not\nyet been collected.","start":1573.18,"duration":1.458},{"text":"So she doesn't have to call down\nto the pathology lab to say,","start":1574.638,"duration":2.862},{"text":"is this blood test result ready.","start":1577.5,"duration":1.52},{"text":"She can immediately\nsee on her mobile phone","start":1579.02,"duration":2.26},{"text":"that actually this\nis a test that needs","start":1581.28,"duration":2.14},{"text":"to be reviewed and examined.","start":1583.42,"duration":1.57},{"text":"She can also see other\nradiology reports","start":1584.99,"duration":2.2},{"text":"and any other\ninformation she needs.","start":1587.19,"duration":1.74},{"text":"She can click on more detail\nto see every single blood","start":1588.93,"duration":3.16},{"text":"test that's been taken\nabout this patient,","start":1592.09,"duration":3.05},{"text":"look at trend analysis,\nlook at previous graphs,","start":1595.14,"duration":2.77},{"text":"compare that with all of the\nother important statistics.","start":1597.91,"duration":2.53},{"text":"So here as she can see that\nthe potassium has spiked.","start":1600.44,"duration":2.3},{"text":"This patient has a dangerously\nhigh level of potassium rising,","start":1602.74,"duration":2.96},{"text":"at 6.2.","start":1605.7,"duration":0.704},{"text":"She can see that the white\nblood cell count is high,","start":1606.404,"duration":2.166},{"text":"which probably means there's\nan infection and was probably","start":1608.57,"duration":2.54},{"text":"why the sepsis alert was\ntriggered in the first place.","start":1611.11,"duration":4.069},{"text":"She can also now, having\nknown that there's","start":1615.179,"duration":1.791},{"text":"an sepsis risk, go\nand look in more","start":1616.97,"duration":2.68},{"text":"detail at that\nradiology exam, where","start":1619.65,"duration":1.604},{"text":"she can see that the report\nsays that there's a right lobe","start":1621.254,"duration":2.416},{"text":"pneumonia.","start":1623.67,"duration":0.93},{"text":"She can zoom in on that, compare\nthat to what she's seen before,","start":1624.6,"duration":3.32},{"text":"and share it with a colleague\nand get a second opinion.","start":1627.92,"duration":2.41},{"text":"And this has all happened before\nshe's arrived at the bedside.","start":1630.33,"duration":2.68},{"text":"She's not even met\nthe patient yet.","start":1633.01,"duration":1.472},{"text":"There's no need to arrive\nand look through the charts","start":1634.482,"duration":2.208},{"text":"and then take a case history.","start":1636.69,"duration":1.48},{"text":"She's done all of this in\nthe corridor, in the lift,","start":1638.17,"duration":3.022},{"text":"and on her way\nthere so that she is","start":1641.192,"duration":1.458},{"text":"prepped and ready to give\nher full human attention","start":1642.65,"duration":3.3},{"text":"to that patient at the bedside.","start":1645.95,"duration":2.335},{"text":"Now she's here and she's\nbeen able to examine","start":1648.285,"duration":1.875},{"text":"Robert's condition.","start":1650.16,"duration":1.28},{"text":"She can text her consultant\nand say actually this patient.","start":1651.44,"duration":4.057},{"text":"Looks like they might need\nan appendectomy they probably","start":1655.497,"duration":2.333},{"text":"basically just need\ntheir appendix out.","start":1657.83,"duration":2.55},{"text":"And so her consultant\ncan-- so now","start":1660.38,"duration":2.5},{"text":"what we've enabled is effective\nescalation by very fast","start":1662.88,"duration":3.38},{"text":"real-time communication.","start":1666.26,"duration":1.44},{"text":"And her consultant can\ntext back and confirm","start":1667.7,"duration":2.92},{"text":"that actually this patient\ndoes need an appendectomy","start":1670.62,"duration":3.46},{"text":"and we should start\ninstigating all of the jobs","start":1674.08,"duration":2.79},{"text":"and procedures and tasks,\nboth automatic and human, that","start":1676.87,"duration":3.15},{"text":"need to take place.","start":1680.02,"duration":0.95},{"text":"So here we see Jamie,\nour ward nurse,","start":1680.97,"duration":2.69},{"text":"texting back saying I'm\ngoing to go ahead and do","start":1683.66,"duration":3.25},{"text":"the blood cultures and\nso on and so forth.","start":1686.91,"duration":2.69},{"text":"So this is our consultant who's\npreparing for the operation.","start":1689.6,"duration":3.32},{"text":"She's got her own\nphone and she's","start":1692.92,"duration":1.91},{"text":"able to tap on admit the patient\nand prepare them for surgery.","start":1694.83,"duration":4.6},{"text":"And automatically we see that\na whole series of subtasks","start":1699.43,"duration":3.62},{"text":"get dispatched across\nthe whole hospital.","start":1703.05,"duration":2.35},{"text":"So we can see that this patient\nneeds to be nil by mouth,","start":1705.4,"duration":2.92},{"text":"they need intravenous\nfluids, someone","start":1708.32,"duration":2.51},{"text":"needs to write up\nthe antibiotics,","start":1710.83,"duration":2.13},{"text":"they need to be consented,\nand so on and so forth.","start":1712.96,"duration":2.71},{"text":"And so all these jobs get\nsent to the right person","start":1715.67,"duration":2.38},{"text":"so that they can be carried\nout at the right time.","start":1718.05,"duration":2.457},{"text":"And obviously, following\nRobert's operation,","start":1720.507,"duration":1.833},{"text":"we can still follow up with\nall of the live

still","start":1725.51,"duration":2.742},{"text":"read through all\nof the information","start":1728.252,"duration":1.458},{"text":"that she needs to see from home\nand keep tabs and communicate","start":1729.71,"duration":2.974},{"text":"with her team so\nthat she can take","start":1732.684,"duration":1.416},{"text":"care of the patient in a\nremote and ongoing way.","start":1734.1,"duration":2.762},{"text":"But ultimately, what\nwe really want to do","start":1736.862,"duration":1.708},{"text":"is put the patient in control.","start":1738.57,"duration":1.66},{"text":"The patient owns\nthe data about her.","start":1740.23,"duration":3.33},{"text":"And we want to make that\navailable on a personal

conditions.","start":1755.13,"duration":1.74},{"text":"And I really believe that\nthis kind of digitization","start":1756.87,"duration":2.48},{"text":"has the potential to truly\ntransform health care.","start":1759.35,"duration":2.275},{"text":"One of the big challenges that\nwe face in the world today","start":1761.625,"duration":2.375},{"text":"is of obesity and diabetes.","start":1764.0,"duration":2.12},{"text":"So 26% of prevalence of\ndiabetes among adults in England","start":1766.12,"duration":4.15},{"text":"is massively rising.","start":1770.27,"duration":1.237},{"text":"And you're much more\nlikely, in fact, you're","start":1771.507,"duration":1.833},{"text":"25 times more likely, to\nsuffer some kind of sight

preventable","start":1778.3,"duration":3.707},{"text":"if you can get in there\nearly and detect it.","start":1782.007,"duration":1.833},{"text":"So these are\npreventable problems","start":1783.84,"duration":2.02},{"text":"if we can get access to\nthe data in real time","start":1785.86,"duration":2.73},{"text":"and identify who\nis at risk of that.","start":1788.59,"duration":2.162},{"text":"So what we've been doing is\nworking with the Moorfields Eye","start":1790.752,"duration":2.458},{"text":"Hospital to look\nat these OCT scans.","start":1793.21,"duration":2.51},{"text":"So these are 3D videos\nof your eye, if you like.","start":1795.72,"duration":3.07},{"text":"And one of the\nchallenges is that we","start":1798.79,"duration":1.5},{"text":"have a 10x shortage of\nradiologists to actually review","start":1800.29,"duration":3.52},{"text":"these images.","start":1803.81,"duration":0.95},{"text":"And so there's massive\ndelays in detecting disease","start":1804.76,"duration":2.239},{"text":"and this can lead to blindness.","start":1806.999,"duration":1.291},{"text":"And so what we\nreally want to do is","start":1808.29,"duration":1.458},{"text":"build algorithms that\ncan learn to

know if you know that but there is really this close connection between deep mind and UCL which started off by two of our founders Thomas and Shane meeting as post doctoral fellows at UCL and then ending up founding deep mind so really at the very root of things deep mind and UCL are connected and I think it's great that we can celebrate that and and use it and by putting out this lecture series and and sharing these thoughts together I will only be the first of several lecturers here are all the lecturers within the series and you will get to know these people if you stick through their lectures and they have a lot of interesting and wonderful things to say and towards the end of this lecture I'm going to go through the topics that they will cover and try to motivate them in the context of the larger field of deep learning here's the plan for the lecture first wheeled self intelligence and and then we'll do some other things when I have the word solving intelligence here that refers to the first part of deep minds mission deep minds missions Hadley has these two parts first solve intelligence and second use it to solve everything else and well that is of course an audacious mission statement we do believe that it's a great North Star to guide our research and so far it it has created a lot of great momentum so I could talk about deep learning in a very broad sense giving examples from all walks of life but I'm sure you're familiar with most most of those and so I'll take a more personal view a more deep centric view also because that's the work that I can authentically speak about and so what I would like to do is go through three case studies of successful deep learning applications to show you the power of deep learning and to motivate you to study it further and in these three case studies a lot of things will come up that you might not understand at this point in time fully but then I can assure you that the subsequent lectures will fill in those gaps and and make you appreciate what's happening here so the first case study is alphago and alpha0 the second one has a little more action to it learning to play the game of capture the flag and the third one goes beyond games and is about folding proteins with alpha fold a deep learning based system and it takes us into the realm of biology and science and then finally the last bit of the lecture I want to go over the the pieces that the subsequent lectures will deliver and put them into a greater context to tell you what's out there and why it's worth learning about these things so let's start with solving intelligence the hallmark of human intelligence is its generality and nobody has expressed this in a crisper way than the science fiction author Robert a Heinlein so he says a human being should be able to change a diaper plan an invasion butcher a hog Koerner ship design a building write a sonnet balance accounts build a wall set a bone comfort the dying take orders give orders cooperate act alone solve equations analyze a new problem pitch manure program a computer cook a tasty meal fight efficiently die gallantly specialization is for insects now nothing accounts against insects because they are actually smart in their very own way and I'm not sure we have actually fully reached that level of intelligence yet but for the purpose of this definition the idea is the ability to do a wide range of things well is a characterization of intelligence now my colleague Shane leg is very passionate about the definition of intelligence so passionate that he sifted through over 70 definitions of intelligence before he arrived at his own synthesis and his definition is intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments you see how that's connected to the Heinlein quote and to what we think of as intelligent behavior now why is this important well if we want to create artificial intelligence we better have some kind of idea how to measure success how to know when we have an intelligent agent now Shane also has mathematics at his heart close to his heart and so he has a formal theory of this definition of intelligence and we will not go into the details but I would just like to point briefly pointed out so this measure of intelligence here on the left is a function of PI a policy where a policy determines what action to take in a given state now this measure of intelligence is expressed as the sum over environments and this term represents the breadth of all the things that an intelligent agent should be able to do and he formalizes this in the framework of algorithmic information theory and so he talks about the sum over all computable environments now we need some something that indicates success and that's this term here the value that policy PI creates in environment mu so how successful is that policy or we expose it to that particular task or environment and here's this thing in the middle is a complexity penalty a waiting term K of MU is the comic or of complexity of the environment mu and so what this says is that if this complexity is low then this term is great and if this complexity is high then this term will be smaller and so the definition gives more weight to simple environments and then progressively less weight to more complex ones of course there are many more complex environments than simple ones and so it also acts as a normalization now the notion of the value and the policy come from a framework called reinforcement learning and in many ways we think of it as a very general purpose framework for AI the idea is that there's an agent and the agent interacts with an environment and that environment poses some kind of task or problem to the agent if you like and so the agent here represented as a neural net observes the state of that world and can then take an action in that world and influence the world and once it has taken that action it receives the subsequent observation what has happened as a consequence of that action and it receives the reward symbolized by the star here is there some kind of positive impact on the agent some measure of success and the goal of this agent is to learn a policy you know the PI from the previous definition such that it maximizes long-term reward so ideally it doesn't just go for the immediate reward but it it plans ahead it tries to act in such a way that in the long term it will be successful in this environment now the beautiful thing is that this framework is so general some people would say overly general that it encompasses things like unsupervised learning and supervised learning as special cases but if you want to learn more about it there is actually a module that colleagues of mine are teaching at UCL here on reinforcement learning so this framework will be important going forward in those first two applications of deep learning that I'm going to talk about and the reason is that the combination of deep learning and reinforcement learning we also refer to it as a deep reinforcement learning is such a powerful combination that we can use to solve interesting interactive problems out there in the world now we started a lot of our work with games and you might be aware of the work on atari games very early on and why do we do that well first of all games are a bit like this reinforcement learning you know you interact with this world and try to solve problems really often they're a microcosm of the real world if you think about typical games you know they are about value monopoly is about money and buying and selling and chess is about has spatial dimensions and time built into it and disease is a war game they have been designed to stimulate intelligence the designers of this game specifically want to stimulate human intelligence so clearly they must have some aspect to them that is is of interest when we want to build intelligence the great thing is we can simulate games you know we can set up simulations large-scale computer simulations and and learn very quickly by playing these games and finally games are great for us to measure progress because often there's some kind of winning or score or success measure associated with games they just think of video games with the little score indicator you know you want to ramp up that score that's great that's a way of measuring progress and in the context of our L of reinforcement learning it can also serve as a reward so that's what it looks like then if we apply deep reinforcement learning to a game in this case pong you know the ideas are the same the agent observes the environment and take actions and then the score here is the reward that the agent gets the reward that is trying to maximize in the long term and then in deep reinforcement learning the policy here the thing that decides in a given state what action to take drastic up drastic down and so on based on seeing this pixel image in this case that is parameterized by a neural network whose parameters were trying to adapt so that the agent has success in the long term for example optimizing long term discounted reward so in this particular application my colleagues ran these reinforcement learning algorithms over close to 50 different Atari games and achieved superhuman level in a lot of these games really by putting the controller into the hand of the reinforcement learning algorithm letting it play these games observing the screen if you like the pixels on the screen and training the system to maximize reward or game score in these games and I just want to use this as an example for how to think about Shane's definition you remember there was the sum over environments and the value that the agent generates in these environments now think of the set of environments as these games and then if we have an algorithm that can do well in all of these games then according to Shane's definition we might be tempted to call that agent to have acquired some degree of intelligence of course not anywhere close to human intelligence but you know just that ability to solve many different tasks to a high standard as the hallmark of intelligence okay so what's the role exactly of deep learning here well in previous machine learning work prior to the deep learning wave if you like for every problem that you wanted to solve with machine learning you first need to define features that describe the state of the problem you know for documents that would be bag of words features and for visual problems that would be particular filters that people defined edge detectors and so on and the new thing with deep learning not new now but you know it was back then is to enable end-to-end learning to put the raw features the pixels near the raw description of the problem in and learn the desired input output mapping just given the loss how you measure success and the architecture of your neural network that's really what I would call the the definition of deep learning now one beautiful thing about deep learning is that through the architecture we can put prior knowledge into the solution of our problem and that makes learning easier in other words it requires less training data if we can do that and hence also less compute and we will talk a little more about this later but this prior knowledge could for example be about space and be about time those basic kunti and notions if you like now what makes deep learning possible and attractive now I would argue it's the great computational power that we have available now GPUs TP use and so on it's the large amount of data that we now have generated by mobile devices online services distributed sensors labels generated by crowdsourcing by people if you like and finally our better understanding of algorithms and architectures and there's a great opportunity here because a lot of these algorithms are out there you know they're an uncute hub you can download them and play with them and a lot of the papers are an archive you know as soon as they're written people upload them on the archive and there's a huge repository of information there to get started in deep learning good ok I would like to move on now to these case studies and start off with alphago and alpha zero some of you may have heard about these projects and so I hope I can deliver some some more details on these and give you the general gist the core paper that I want to talk about is this paper a general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess shogi and go through self play learning with my great colleagues David silver tomorrow bear Julien Schmidt feasor and Eunice and no blue and others what you see here is the scene where were ad job who we also call the hand of alphago because he acts as alpha goes hand where he plays and here lee sedol on the other side in this 2016 match which was captured in in this Netflix documentary that you might want to check out if you haven't seen it so what's the problem with go go is a beautiful game complex with beautiful strategies doesn't take long to learn but a lifetime to master and the problem is that there are so many different moves in any given position the 361 vertices on which you can take turns to place black and white stones to surround territory and there's just so many different ways in which games can develop and that's where deep learning kicks in and in particular we use two neural networks to reduce the size of the search space the space of possible games in which we need to do our planning the first one we call the policy network and the policy network takes as input a raw goal position you're now characterized by empty black and white points on this 19 by 19 grid and maps it to a probability distribution over moves so given a go position this thing is a probability for each move being played in a particular position now we have a second neural network we call the value network and the value network also takes a given position but it just produces one number basically the evaluation of that position is this position good for black or is it good for white and how was this trained in alphago well we were lucky we had access to a lot of human game records that people had recorded from very strong players and so the first thing we could do was imitation learning we could use deep learning to learn the policy network to really just learn to imitate the human players and that gave us the weights for the policy network you know the network observes a position it observes the professional or the highly skilled move played in that position and now it's a simple mapping from the input board representation to that label if you like now at that point we had a policy network that was able to play in a similar way to very strong human players it could imitate them so we could use that neural network to very quickly generate more games and so we generated a lot of games that then allowed us to train the value network because what the value network requires is an again an input representation for the board and the outcome of the game did black win or did white win and from very many such pairs it can then learn the probability for any given position for black or white to win and this is already a form of reinforcement learning because we're learning the value function that I talked about earlier now how do we use these neural networks they actually use them much in the way that humans would use their intuition when they approach the game the problem is there's this huge search tree when you expand from a given position all the different ways black can play than all the counters by white and black and white and so on it's a huge search space and it would be hopeless to just try and plan within that space if you didn't have any guidance but these two neural networks they give us that guidance the policy network allows us to be smart about the moves that we choose we don't need to check out all the moves that start from this position we can focus on the promising ones on the ones where the professional or strong go player would be likely to play and that biases the search in the right direction now the problem that remains is that the game tree is still very deep a typical game of go can last 200 moves 250 moves even longer sometimes so how do we deal with that that's where the value net comes in because we don't need to go all the way to the end of the game to observe its outcome if black wins or white wins we can stop somewhere in the middle after a few moves and use the trained value network to give us an estimate of how good the position is for black or for white and so together the policy network and the value network reduce the size of this huge search tree and allow us to traverse it and find good plans in it and that's what alphago does and it worked we weren't always sure it would work but in 1968 in 2016 we had the match against isa dal a phenomenal 9dan professional go player from korea and at that point no program had ever beat a professional player at that level in a match and in a very exciting match alphago ended up winning four games to one and if you want to share that excitement I really recommend that you take a look at this Netflix documentary alphago which details our paths there and and also the drama of the match good so much for alphago but we weren't quite happy with that because alphago go is just one game right and so we said that intelligence requires us the agent to be able to solve more than one game maybe three games you know not much but a little better and so I'd like to talk about alpha zero and and how that managers not only to play two more games but also use much less human knowledge because remember alphago was still using those professional game records and also some some additional features that we had designed and so what's interesting is that a short story by Stefan spike the Royal game can give us some insight into how alpha0 approaches the SPRO this problem you see here on the right Stefan's like the author and the book tells the story of dr. B an innocent man who has been arrested and is being held in solitary confinement not unlike our learning agents that the B is alone in his small world and starved for stimulation I quote they did nothing other than subjecting us to complete nothingness for as is well known nothing on earth puts more pressure on the human mind than nothing while waiting for an interrogation dr. B manages to steal a book from one of his captors a book about the game of chess eager to engage his mind dr. B devours the book and learns to play chess on a makeshift board in his cells he replaced the master games from the book over and over again but after a few weeks the games from the book have lost their novelty desperately looking for further diversion dr. B attempts to play chess against himself but he soon realized that he can only play against himself if he splits his mind into two halves and I black and then I white only now with two agents in play through interaction and learning can happen later on a cruise ship dr. B meets the world chess champion of the time when Mirko sent ovitch an expert at chess and only at chess in a stunning demonstration of his skills dr. B manages to do the impossible he wins at chess against the world chess champion now fast forward 80 years and Stefan Sykes story becomes reality in a way that not even the author could have imagined and he could imagine a lot the modern center which stock fish the world computer Chess Champion 2016 a good old-fashioned AI for playing chess and only chess the modern dr. B I would argue alpha0 an artificial agent that learns to play chess solely by playing against itself now here you see some results as white alpha zero wins almost 30 percent of its game against his games against stock fish and as black it manages to draw most of the time and even wins the humor games then stock fish does you have to imagine stock fish is an is a good old-fashioned AI a program that has been designed by people by chess experts and so on and uses an enormous number of heuristics to cut down the search tree and uses all kinds of domain knowledge about chess now here you see the development over time as alpha zero trains this is the route these are thousands of steps and you see here the e low number that's how we measure success here and after roughly four hours of training alpha zero surpasses stock fish in its chess skills so how does this work the trick of course is a form of reinforcement learning and self play as you may have inferred from this story alpha zero is also all alone in some sense playing chess against itself and here's how it works so initialized with the policy and value network alpha zero plays by evaluating the search tree from a given position in making its best move then taking that next position again taking policy and value net and tree search to evaluate its net next move and so on and so forth it plays in place in place and generates a lot of games at its current level of chess which is very low at the beginning because it's just starting and P and V there are at this point almost random but then now we have games generated and we can train the policy network because now we have a position and we know which move was made and we can train the policy network to imitate that move we can do that for the next position and the next position and so on the move made by alpha zero previously is the label from which the policy network learns it's basically imitating itself augmented by search similarly we can train the value Network and predict the winner of these games because we know those games we've played them all the way to the end so for a given position we know how it will end and we can train in your network that estimates that now finally we put these new policy and value networks into the tree search and generate new games let alpha zero play against itself but now at a higher level because the new policy network and the new value network are better and hence together with the tree search they generate better moves and we can generate higher quality games of chess that's how it works and it actually works not only for chess but also for go and for shogi and these are just comparisons to how long it takes to over to reach the levels of the more traditional kind tenders for being the best programs in this space now one thing that I found very interesting is how does alpha zero reason about chess positions in order to appreciate that you need to understand that a classical chess program on the left evaluates tens of millions of positions before it makes a remove it expands the tree to that many nodes now alpha zero only expands about tens of thousands of positions less by a factor of a thousand so it's search is much more focused and of course that still a far cry from how human grandmasters operate because they only evaluate hundreds of position their intuition for chess is so great that they are very good at both selecting the lines they look at and evaluating the resulting positions but you see here that in some sense we've made a move from this brute force approach towards the smarter way of solving these problems that humans employ one thing I like is that we actually discovered some chess knowledge here or not we actually alpha zero did you know for example traditional openings like the English opening was discovered by alpha zero and it continues to play it there's there's other openings that are also known to humans that are discovered but then discarded you know not good enough alpha zero understood that that line although it's been played by humans for a long time you know just not good enough I want to give you one example of play of alpha zero this is my favorite game it's called the immortal souped swung game super strong is a german word that indicates a situation in which it's not actually advantageous for a site to move but they'd rather stay still and do nothing but the rules of chess don't allow that so what you see here is alpha zero as white and stockfish as black and you see here that whites pieces are very active and black is very crammed into this corner with the Queen in the corner blocked by that rock the King also blocked in these two rocks protecting that porn it doesn't look good and now we can take a look at which moves actually or which pieces black cannot move in this situation and the tragedy of the position if you like is that moving any of these pieces leads to a loss for black and so you see that alpha zero has a real appreciation of these positional advantages the mobility of the pieces and and dominating the board okay let's conclude the learning helps us conquer this huge search space and self play produces the large amount of data that we need to train these deep neural networks there's also another thing at play which we call an automatic curriculum because you know at the at the beginning the system starts to play in a very weak fashion and as it becomes better its opponent also becomes better and so it always trains against opponent that's just of the right level because it's training against itself and that automatic curriculum leads to stronger and stronger play and the system discovers new knowledge which i think is is a beautiful property of AI systems there's still many open questions it's just a game and relatively small spaces as opposed to real world situations but it's an interesting first step there's more material that you can look at if you're interested now let's move to a more action filled game learning to play the game of capture the flag this is based on a recent science paper with max jailer burg Wojtek Ronettes key and in Dunning and it's about playing the game of capture the flag so it's a large scale a decentralized multi agent learning problem because capturing the flag is an objective game where multiple agents need to learn to interact to play it well and you see here a first-person perspective and here a top-down view of a typical game situation how does this game work well this we play it as a 2v2 game the you go run to the opponent base and pick up the flag you want to bring it back to your own base but you need to make sure that when you capture it that your own flag is at your own base let's take a look at this from the game's perspective here this is the agent perspective and this is the top-down perspective and you'll see how this game works so you see the blue agents there they're going to the towards the red flag and capture it and they want to now bring it back to their own base and the trick is that you really need to have your flag at your base to score and that's that's why you need coordination for example now their flag has been stolen by the red agent and so they need to tag that red agent and get their flag back before they can score score a flag of their own now the types of environments that you see here we have - we have an outdoor version you know one that's placed in some kind of desert setting and here we have an indoor version we wanted to show that the system can handle these two types of very different terrains and specifically what's interesting here is we use procedural generation whereas you and I we would probably play this game on the same map every time or maybe it just changed maps a few times what we require the agents to do here is to play on a different map every single time and here you see a sample of these maps they all look different and what that does is when the agents learn to play on these varied maps they learn to generalize they learn robust strategies that work in all kinds of maps rather than just rote learning a particular map and so the trick is also to train a population of agents and you see here our training setup there's a population of agents down here and they connect to what we call arenas each one of these is a little game simulation and some sample of these this population connects to the games for agents to on blue side to on red side they play they learn they get feedback they win or they lose and then that stream of experience is routed back to those agents and that's where the neural networks are updated and they learn and they are trained pretty much independently other than through their interaction in the arena Kirsten you're a network architecture that we use it's a two level hierarchy of recurrent neural networks a fast one and a slow one so we can cover different timescales and it also learns about the reward signal because this problem is very difficult if you only ever get a reward signal at the end you know you imagine you play a five-minute game of capture the flag and in the end someone tells you oh you just won or you just lost and you now need to figure out going back in the game what was it that made me win or what was it that made me lose wouldn't it be much better if you had some intermediate rewards like oh I just take the opponent that must have been a good thing or I just got the flag of the opponent and so that's what happens at this top level when we learn those rewards we also use a population of agents because that allows us to get some robustness towards different playing styles different agents learn to play the game in different ways and so when agents train against these different agents they again need to develop robust strategies in order to succeed in this game so here you see the results and again we measure agent skill in ello so the higher it is the better and this is how they develop over time you see here this is the baseline a random atrum that doesn't do much it's just chittering about you know randomly naive self play doesn't quite work as you can see here it's almost as bad as the random here is the baseline of an average human and here's the baseline of a strong human and you see that the agent the deep learning aid redeveloped in this work learns and learns and learns surpasses the average surpasses the strong human and ends up with a much higher skill than all of them now one thing that we found particularly nice is when we test it with humans we also let them fill in some questionnaires and we asked them so which ones of your teammates was most collaborative you know with whom could you work the best and it turns out that the human players indicated that they liked it best to play with the AI big you know they found it reliable and strong and you know they wanted to play with the AI so a nice finding now I'd also like to use this example to show you something that is maybe a little underappreciated and it's the idea of understanding how these trained agents that behave in these arguably quite clever ways in these environments represent the world and in order to do that we've here done a tease me embedding like a two-dimensional embedding of the internal states of the agents as they play this game and we can color the points by our knowledge of the game situation for example here we know that this these points represent situations in which the agent flag is at the base the opponent flag is at their base and the agent is in their home base you know we know that because we can look at the game but the agents also know that you know they know that this is a particular type of situation and they represented by internal activations that are all similar to one another and that are different from a different situation like here where the agent flag is taken the opponent flag is held by the teammate and so somehow in their internal representations they've learned what a given situation is like and as a consequence they can use that to make the make good decisions about how to play in those situations and good decisions they make here are some patterns of behavior that we've observed and here for example home base defense they try to defend their own home base they sometimes camp in the opponent home base you know they just wait there until the flag responds and they can they can steal it or they can follow the teammate and really just work together in in the same area and it turns out that this most advanced agent is actually most similar in playing style to to the humans that we observed playing and I just want to emphasize there's a whole dimension of research out there where we not only train these systems but we look at their internal representation how do they represent the world and we look at their behavior and really understand how they solve the problem so that we can learn from that but also ensure that they behave in safe ways for example if it's a safety critical problem good now we've seen that in the in this more complex multiplayer game the agents can clearly reach human level it takes a lot of compute to achieve that no doubt training populations is important because you want a diverse training signal and the self play that still worked for alphago for alpha zero didn't actually work here because they just learned one strategy and there wasn't enough diversity and robustness in there a second thing of course that makes things robust is that we have diversity of environments because they we procedurally generate them and we can begin to understand how these agents behave and write this papers and blog posts on this that you can read to pick up more detail now as the third case study I would like to go beyond games and talk about how we can use deep learning to learn to fold proteins and the particular project I'll talk about is called alpha fold and the paper is called improved protein structure prediction using potentials from deep learning and is worked by my colleagues Andres senior Richard Evans John jumper and James Kirkpatrick and many others so what is this about what is this protein forwarding first let's understand what proteins are some of you may know more about this than I do and but here's the gist there are the fundamental building blocks of life they carry out all kinds of functions in our bodies they catalyze reactions they transduce signals across the cell membrane they regulate genes they do cellular transport they they provide antibodies and they're very important for clinical drugs often they are the target of particular drugs but also many drugs are proteins and the key thing we need to know to understand the protein is its shape what the shape of a given protein on the right here you see this amazing animation of proteins in action and you can see they really act as molecular machines you know then they can fulfill an amazing diversity of functions in the body depending on their shape now the interesting thing is that in some sense the specification of a protein is just a chain of amino acids it's it's a sequence of amino acids from an alphabet of 20 different amino acids and what happens is that these amino acids they interact locally to form these shapes for example HeLa C's or sheets and then these HeLa season sheets they interact more globally to form the 3d shape of the overall protein and then proteins can interact to do all of these amazing things now the the problem that we want to solve is that of protein structure prediction and you have to imagine that these proteins they have a backbone it's basically the kind of the main chain that determines their shape and they have these little side chains that that influence how these how this backbone interacts with itself as it folds back on itself and if we can figure out from the sequence you know this is the sequence of amino acids what the 3d shape of the protein is then we can understand what this protein does because it acts when it's in this 3d shape you can also imagine that if we have a shape in mind that we want to create it would be really good to have this kind of mapping available because then we could invert it and from the desired shape device the sequence of amino acids that we would need to create in order to build the thing that falls into that particular shape it's known as the inverse problem now how can we think about the shape of these proteins the goal really is to predict for every atom in this protein exactly where it ends up when it folds but one way of parameterizing this is through the torsion angles and once we have all these 2n torsion angles which are the angles how these different bonds connect to one another then we know the 3d shape just imagine if you wanted to determine the shape of these things someone told you which way they rotate at each point and you would be able to figure out where they are so those are the parameters that we're looking for once we have these angles then we should be done but there's a paradox and that is called Leventhal paradox and it's basically the following many naturally occurring proteins fold reliably and quickly to their native state despite the astronomical number of possible configurations so how if there are so many ways in which these things can fold how do they find the right way so that they end up in exactly the shape that's necessary in their living organism and I've done a little example here so suppose we have a chain length of 361 amino acids and just at any point there are three different ways in which they could fold then we would have three ^ 361 is roughly ten to the 172 configurations in which they could fold now imagine these proteins can wiggle really quickly and they can explore ten to the thirteen different configurations per second or ten to the twenty per year that seems like really quick search through that space right but it would still take 10 to the 152 years to sample all the possible configurations it's a huge space and for those of you who know the game of Go I have chosen 361 is the example on purpose here because that's the number of vertices and a go board and three ^ 361 is an upper bound on the number of legal go positions of all the kind of ways in which you can have a go position and John trump actually calculated how many legal positions there actually are in go and you see I tend to get sidetracked to go because I just love the game and he represents that number as a ternary number and a ternary number because any of these points can have three states empty black or white can be represented as a go position and so this is the go position that as rare if you read it as a ternary number represents the number of legal positions in the game of goal now you might be wondering is it a legal position it is an illegal position you know there's a black stone here where it shouldn't be and another one here and that's actually accurate because the majority of these configurations of a go board are in fact not legal positions but back to $11 per adducts there's a huge search space but we know that deep learning can do something about deep search spaces so let's do that so why do we want to use deep learning for protein folding there are experimental methods of course to determine the structure of of proteins but it's a very difficult modeling problem we have data available 150,000 proteins in the protein data bank which was founded in 1971 so this is a long ongoing process but we have much less data than for some of the other tasks like speech recognition or image recognition so it's a little harder there's another advantage there is CASP which is an assessment some kind of competition that provides a benchmark for protein folding so there's a way of testing how well a system does so what should we predict it turns out that the 3d structure of such a protein is fully described by a dispair wise distance matrix so if you have all of these points in space if you know all the pairwise distances between them then you know what that configuration in space looks like and so the main thing that's being predicted in this system is this distance matrix conveniently it looks a bit like an image and you know images we're good at at addressing with deep learning here's how the Alpha fold system works the sequence comes in here and we generate certain features from databases so it's not quite just using the raw data but it's pulling in features about these sequences from databases and then it does its distance predictions also some angle predictions and it produces a score function and this score function is a number that measures for a given forwarding configuration for that sequence how good that foldings configuration is and it's differentiable and if it's differentiable we can do gradient descent and we can optimize it and that's really the key idea behind this work I will not go into the details of this deep dilated convolution convolutional residual network but my colleagues in the future lectures will discuss architectures in greater detail and you will have no trouble understanding what's going on here once you've been through their lectures that's just one thing be said it's a very very deep neural network with 220 of these blocks one after the other good how accurate are the predictions the first thing we can compare is ground truth of this distance matrix with the estimates of the system and we find that the system does a good job at capturing not only short term interactions but also long long-range interactions and then we can compare the foldings themselves and these are good examples where the folding worked well but you can see here that blue which are Alpha false predictions and green are reasonably well aligned so it the system understands the gist of these proteins and and how they forward the second step is this gradient descent that we can do now that we have a potential and energy function if you like that we want to optimize we can use gradient descent on these angles and and just wiggle down in these in this configuration space and there you see that here in action it's literally optimizing the coordinates of all the different bits and folding in the process trying to optimize the score that has opted that it has estimated to be a good potential for this problem you started multiple times to discover local optima but overall it's a gradient descent operation now I said earlier that one reason this was such a nice set up for deep learning is that there's a good assessment exercise and this is cusp in this case calves 13 and it is a it is a competition in which there are 82 chains that fold into some 3d structures but they are not known to the community yet they're kept secret and so these chains are released one chain per day for a period of time and then the participating teams have three weeks to return five guesses or predictions of what they think that particular chain will forward into and it's a very popular competition over 90 groups from different labs across the world participate and then they have a particular scoring mechanism which boils down to measuring how close the predictions are to the to the ground truth that has been determined by those experimental techniques and this is a fantastic piece of work designing this competition and were indepted two decades of work here of those people who run the competition or the participants but of course also those people who do with the experimental work of producing this data because that's hard work some people estimate that for some proteins it takes an entire PhD thesis to get the 3d structure and entire PhD thesis that's a lot of work ok so here are the results these are the different teams that participated and in fact the deep learning system comes out as the best performing system in this in this exercise so this deep learning based distance prediction clearly works it gives more accurate predictions of contact between residues although it estimates distance previously a lot of systems used contact when they're close enough to go to one another closer than a test rooms but it also delivers richer information because you can imagine this is there's more information in a distance than in the binary signal or if something is together or further apart right we have more information and finally because it's a smooth prediction and we get these distances it's real numbers it's also a smoother potential that is easier to optimize and we see that's why the gradient descent for finding the right car configurations works there are many limitations still of course the a curious accuracy of the system is still limited it doesn't work so well on some some proteins or protein templates the method depends on what we pull out of that database so only because there's a database of structures can we get the features that allow us to make those predictions and also it only predicts the backbone and we then use a tool called Rosetta to fill in the side chains so it's it's one small step in in a problem that has been thought about and worked on for many decades but it shows that deep learning has something to contribute to these problems in science and specifically in biology good so that was the three case studies that I wanted to present alphago the classic if you like with its extension into alpha zero a board game a video game the game of capture the flag with more players more richer interactions harder to process visuals and so on and finally an example from the world of science where deep learning can really make a contribution to scientific progress in a field where that matters because it might help develop new new cures now I'd like to use the rest of the time to give you an overview of the field of deep learning by going through the different lecture topics that my colleagues are going to talk about and here they are and we start with number two because we just in the process of doing number one the first lecture away after this one is on the foundations of neural networks and will be developed at the delivered by Wojtek Ronettes key and it will really answer the questions what our neural networks what kinds of functions can they represent how are they trained you know back propagation some review of those ideas many of you will be familiar with them but I can tell you when Roy Tech explains these things then they become clearer than they have ever been and of course also what are the limitations of neural networks limitations of neural networks have led to the first neural network winter men decades ago when neural networks with only a single layer were not able to solve the simple XOR problem and when only only adding a second layer to the neural network then enables the system to solve this kind of problem so that's these things are important to know the second lecture after that or a number lecture number three will be on convolutional neural networks for image recognition given by sundar dilemma and the idea here is really to pick up on the on the thought that we want to imbue the neural network with a form of prior knowledge because that will make learning more efficient than more data efficient and introducing convolutional neural networks is one way of doing that convolutions encode a particular week prior about how images behave for example they can encode translation invariant you know no matter where an object is in the in the image it will still be the same thing and we'd like to encode these things in our neural networks and convolutional neural networks brainchild of Jung Lacan in his little net five work they really revolutionized image recognition because they made these neural networks competitive for these tasks and nowadays every neural network application in the area of vision makes use of convolutional neural networks now in the next lecture Viorica Petrossian will talk about vision beyond image net and object recognition and talk about more advanced models and this might involve object detection semantic segmentation you know what is what in a given scene estimation of optical flow she will also talk about analysis of videos videos can be viewed just as stacked images in time and there are interesting tasks there for example action recognition from a single frame you might not know what someone is doing but if you see a video of it then there's an action going on you might want to recognize what that is you know for example someone smashing in the window or doing a sports exercise the next thing is self supervised learning one problem that deep learning is plagued with is that it are it's supervised variant depends on labels you know when we learn object recognition we need a photo and a label what's in it so to speak but in self supervised learning we can learn a lot about the world without labels and this is particularly interesting if you have multiple modalities think of a video on YouTube there's a video stream but there's also an audio stream and the audio can tell us something about the video and the video can tell us something about the audio and so we can learn representations from that the next lecture is on optimization for machine learning given by James Martin's so you can think of optimization as the engine that drives the learning process and of course it's a very old field how to how to optimize functions and he will focus in particular on gradient based optimization methods and their application to training neural networks he'll cover gradient descent momentum methods second-order methods and stochastic methods and just to give you an example this is a visualization of the error surface of the lost surface of a neural network you see it's a complex beast it has this fine substructure everywhere with local optima there's a super interesting result in particular in this paper here mode connectivity that there are all of these little Optima this local Optima but there's a path between them where when you walk along purl in the parameter space along this path all the solutions along that path are relatively good solutions that generalize well and those connect those modes and you know there's a lot of complexity here in those lust surfaces and we need to understand optimization to to become good at training these neural networks I will then move on to sequences and recurrent networks delivered by Marta gar nello and this is again the idea that we want to imbue the neural network with prior knowledge but this time its knowledge about time its knowledge about sequences maybe the idea that in a sequence for what happens now more recent stuff have matters more than stuff that happened longer time ago and why is this important well if you think about it a lot of data comes in the form of sequences speech text DNA sequences video audio they're all sequences we might think of vectors that's like the first thing that we learned in machine learning but almost all the interesting stuff comes in sequences and so she will discuss recurrent neural networks and also the famous LST M's long short-term memory which is a way of dealing with the problem of vanishing gradients in training recurrent neural networks another interesting task here is sequence to sequence learning suppose you want to translate one language to another that's one sequence to another and so there's there's ways of training neural networks to do that as well we'll then move on to deep learning for natural language processing in some sense a special case of the previous work and Felix will discuss why deep learning is a good technique for language and he'll discuss simple recurrent your networks apply to language but also more complex models up to transformers which is one of the most successful models he'll also talk about unsupervised learning because not every piece of text is labeled so what can we learn if we just have a dump of Wikipedia or reddit you know a vast amount of text can we learn something about language from that without having labels and finally he'll also talk about subtle things like situated language understanding you know what does the situation of a particular agent tell us the grounding the interaction of language in the world here's just a tiny example of some recent very exciting work in language modeling you know where they train this huge model I think on the reddit corpus of a lot of data and it's a system that you can prompt with some input text and it will then produce a continuation of that text and it produces very fluent text I'll just read the completion but you know it's about the prompt is about scientists discovering unicorns you know pretty absurd but the model just keeps going the scientists named the population after the distinctive horn of its unique urn these four horned silver white unicorns were previously unknown to science you know it's kind of superficially makes sense you listen to it and it sounds like English right what's going on so then Alex graves will talk it will turn your and his attention to attention and memory in deep learning which are emergent topics that are very important we know of course that for human cognition attention and memory are very important but can you renege works and body these ideas it turns out that they can and you can even foreign normal in your network see that it will pay particular attention if you like to some parts of the input rather than others to solve particular tasks we call that implicit attention but we can also make that explicit we can build mechanisms that allow the neural network to zoom in on particular parts of the input to put its attention there if you like and the highlight of that lecture might well be the idea of the neural Turing machine or differentiable neural computer where there's a neural network controller that has access to an external memory that can write to it and read from it and it can solve problems in this way for example it can write the graph of the of the London Underground system into this memory and then answer questions about it about the connectivity of that graph so that should be an interesting one now then move to unsupervised learning in particular generative latent variable models and variational inference by Andreini and I already mentioned unsupervised learning is very important because we don't have labels for a lot of tasks and in particular and interesting model that he will consider is the auto encoder model at the variational auto encoder model and the idea here is that from data you might want to infer some latent variable responsible for generating that data for example there's the image of a digit and you might want to determine what the label of that digit is but then given the label of that digit you might want to generate images of those digits and training these jointly is the model of the variational auto encoder and it's a very powerful model for unsupervised learning when you don't have labels but when you need your system to learn the underlying representation then in lecture 10 will continue with work on unsupervised learning with the focus on representations and this will be delivered by me al or Oscar and Irina Higgins and they'll ask the question what is a good representation which of course is task dependent but can we characterized how we would like to represent the world and they'll argue that unsupervised learning has the potential to address a lot of the open problems that deep learning is struggling with for example the large amount of data of labelled data that is needed and they will discuss different approaches to this here's a little example there's a data set of 3d or of 2d projections of 3d chairs and you know they just come in the the system is just confronted with those how would it structure its perception of those it turns out that this bethe variational auto encoder is able to find different angle dimensions in this chaos where for example here's a dimension along which the rotation of the of the chair is discovered as one independent dimension the width of the chair is discovered as another independent dimension and the leg style is discovered as yet another independent dimension so this algorithm is thrown at this collection of data and it discovers what we would call natural factors in this data and that of course can be very useful for downstream tasks in lecture 11 we'll talk about generative adversarial networks this is delivered by Mahalo rasca and Jeff Donohue and this is a particularly fascinating recent development namely a model a generative model for data that is based on a little game that is being played it's really multi agency to agency there are two planners the generator that generates data and it discriminate that tries to discriminate if I want to generate a generated if that's the genuine image for the data or if it's just something that there was Maori generate and by thing is name in gradient space if you like this is gonna make it becomes better measuring what the generals from real data but the generator becomes better and better at fooling the discriminator to generate data that really looks like real data and there are now many variations of this it's in Goodfellow started this work in 2014 and it's it's one of the very interesting and hot topics in deep learning now finally and I'm very happy that we have this in the program the last lecture will be on the topic of responsible innovation and will be given by our son Gabriel and Charlie chin and the thought here is that AI provides powerful tools that are shaping our lives and our society but that of course with the great power that we can wield here also comes great responsibility and we would like to address that in this final lecture in two ways the first one is about building safe robust and verified AI systems that do what we like them to do for example you hear you see an example of an adversarial example where a classifier classifies this image correctly as a deer but if you add just a tiny bit of noise to it the right kind of noise adversarial noise it will then miss classify almost the same image as a bird so these systems are not robust and we need to understand the boundaries of what these systems can do and there's a whole field developing around this idea that we need our AI systems to be a lot like normal engineering reliable and robust and so on and we're beginning to understand how to do this better and better and the second aspect of this lecture is how to think about the ethics ethical consequences of building AI systems and more as a joke and the starting point I've put here the Three Laws of Robotics by Asimov the science fiction writer because you know already 80 years ago he was thinking about the consequences of deploying AI systems in the world and had some idea of how they would need to be thought about the ethics of this and what kinds of laws they should be following and of course now we are confronted with systems that actually do influence the world you know you have questions of employment where where there's automation and AI systems can now do a lot of the jobs that that humans can do more and more in the future probably you have the questions of of bias and fairness that these systems inherit certain properties from the datasets that they learned from that we might not agree with and that we might want to change maybe an opportunity to change some things here and so yes and we'll we'll talk about these aspects of our work in AI close the series of lectures okay that's all I had to say thank you very much now we have some time for questions do you have any yes please yes so the question is what are the most important limitations of deep learning and if there are any there are plenty I would say it's an emergent technology if I had to name my number one it would be the lack of data efficiency so with all of these examples I've shown we had a lot of data available in these reinforcement learning scenarios we generated a lot of that data ourselves but in other settings we might need to draw on existing data sets and they might just be limited in size for example in the protein folding situation we have these 150,000 folded proteins with a lot of duplicates but that's not actually that much data for what deep learning requires and my colleagues used a lot of data augmentation techniques to squeeze out the maximum of information out of this so that would be my number one data efficiency because as humans we are also we're very data efficient in our learning and if we could approach that with deep learning I think that would be great another one of my concerns that is a little related to it is energy consumption because these computational systems also consume a lot of energy and we know that our brain works on roughly 20 watts like that's a dim light bulb so how how can we bridge that gap that's another one of those and then on the side of a I I think there's way to go in questions like flexibility and common sense you know what we might characterize as fluid intelligence our it to quickly adapt to a new question to a new situation to understand to act appropriately those are the big areas to work on plenty of key ftcc's out there yeah so I think they go in the right directions but they're really only the the beginning of the path the goal your you asked you correctly characterizes that we want this generality these many different things and how do how do these settings help us in the entire games there clearly is a set of very different games that characterize you know that that require a very different behavior so there is some diversity there is it enough diversity you know ideally we would have a less constrained setting more real-world noisier with more different challenges that's true but I think you have to see the trend you know for example in alphago we started with a single game and a lot of human knowledge that came into it and then we generalized it to three different games that the system can now play and of course it could be trained on other games as well so we expanded the class of things and I think the game we're playing here is we want to always expand the class of things that we can do with our available methods and and eventually have a very large pool of things that can be done yes that's a good question so does this autonomous driving take us somewhere near our real intelligence because it requires the right reaction in so many different scenarios another way that we think about this is is autonomous driving AI complete is it true that if you can flawlessly drive and have a self-driving car does that mean that you have a full intelligence and I think it's it's kind of in between but because there still comes some constraints there but it is it's almost like that because there is such a wide variety of different scenarios as you're describing and currently systems don't have the flexibility to react to these so I don't think the the right approach here is to to just add data and try to sample that space of situations we need to come up with new ideas how the system can reason about about the world you know maybe with physical models maybe with multi agent models because a lot of the predictions we do in in traffic are based on our understanding of what the other agents want you know does this agent want to dis car want to overtake me what does that bicycle ride I want to do do they want to turn so all of these things so I think as we improve our understanding of how to model physical systems how to model multi-agent systems and how to acquire common sense then we'll be approaching autonomous driving it's a beautiful example because it's kind of it's so clear what we want to do here in autonomous driving yet it is so hard other questions yes please that's a good question are we entering into the new caste competition I don't know but my colleagues are certainly very passionate about the problem and and work has continued on protein folding for us this protein folding this this was one step in that work and but we're in that for the long term so they are certainly interested yes please right yeah so the question is if we do reinforcement learning with say two agents that train against one another will they explore the whole space of possibilities or could they be get stuck in some particular part of strategy space so that's that's a very real concern even in a single agent reinforcement learning setting the problem of exploration versus exploitation is a huge problem so in order to reach long-term reward maximize long-term reward the agent needs to explore the system and figure out what works and what doesn't but at the same time it can then not exploit what it already knows about the system because if it only exploits it will not find out about other parts of that space so even in single agent RL exploration is a huge problem in a 2-player self play kind of scenario it can be a problem but we were able to overcome it with a bit of randomization in in alpha zero that has somehow led led it to explore a lot of other options but in the capture-the-flag work we went one step further and we created a pool of diverse players that play differently and and that was in an attempt to address exactly the problem we're pointing out because that a single player then to have a strategy that can deal with a number of other opponent strategies and even teammate strategies and they that's the same type of robustness that that we're looking for in other intelligent systems you know be able to deal with a large variety of situations p-nut environments or opponents or teammates that's exactly the question yeah again that's a very good question how do we measure that one way of measuring it is by doing experiments with humans because humans are incredibly good at figuring out the patterns and finding counter strategies and that's why we did both in alpha go and alpha zero but also in the capture the flag work we benchmarked with humans and they did find some interesting strategies an alternative is to Train yet another agent that is just designed to exploit the given agent that that we're trying to test it's just designed to find the weaknesses in it and if reinforcement learning works then that agent will find weaknesses in it and in the alpha star work where my colleagues applied deep learning and RL to the game of StarCraft they had explicit exploiter agents in the pool they were training against whose sole role was to exploit the given agents as being trained to avoid it from developing degenerate strategies any other questions yes you immediately works for such as in makeup to the black case where you never work for tagging the therapist if you capture many points for that your agent might decide to ignore the game and just go around attacking enemies yeah a nice place and if that's true yes that's that's a good question so it is a big problem how do we specify a reward function such that the resulting system that optimizes them actually solves the problem that were interested in and the the answer is sometimes simple in the game of go that last you know you want a win rather than lose so there is clear in the game of capture the flag it's also clear you also want to win that game but it's such a spaz reward signal that you want intermediate rewards and the way we did it in that work I didn't dwell on that is we actually learned a wait for the different game events that we can observe you know capture a flag tag an opponent be tagged your flag being stole and so on there's a whole list of game events those are the events that real players of this game gets points for in the game and we learned a waiting function for these and the weighting function was learned to optimize for the final outcome go up and so there is a way of bootstrapping the learning process from the final outcome to denser more informative reward signals that the RL agents can then pick up on it's one way of solving it I think okay I'm afraid you need to wrap up our terms up I hope we can welcome you to the next lecture on the basics of neural networks by a Vortech have a great evening Thanks [Applause] you","wTSbvYBx4eg":"look around you almost everything you see is the product of intelligence of human intelligence the Magnificent theater where in the cloth we're wearing the ideas we're sharing intelligence is the creative principle behind things like the theory of relativity the Mona Lisa the idea of democracy so now imagine the possibilities if we could create true artificial intelligence if we could make intelligence abundant through computers I'm here to tell you that there is nothing more human than the pursuit of artificial intelligence I'm a research scientist a deep mind an artificial intelligence research lab our goal is to create through artificial intelligence through AI why we believe that artificial intelligence is a tool that can help us solve some of the world's most complex problems problems like climate change clean energy access to water and fighting disease artificial intelligence offices a chance to accelerate progress on questions like these by acting as a multiplier for human ingenuity but in order to create artificial intelligence we first need to understand exactly what intelligence is the hallmark of human intelligence is its generality nobody has expressed this idea more vividly than science fiction author Robert a Heinlein a human being should be able to change a diaper plan an invasion butcher a hog Connor ship design a building write a sonnet balance accounts build a wall set a bone comfort the dying take orders give orders cooperate act alone solve equations analyze a new problem pitch manure program a computer cook a tasty meal fight efficiently die gallantly specialization is for insects after sifting through over 70 definitions of intelligence my colleague Shane leg arrived arrived at a very similar conclusion intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments or in his favorite language so let's unpack this definition who or what can be intelligent the answer is what we call an agent someone or something that can take action this could be a human being it could be a machine it could be a piece of software in order to be intelligent an agent needs to be able to achieve goals but not just a few or very specific ones goals in a wide range of environments clearly the definition calls for a generalist specialists need not apply so how would you go about building an intelligent machine here's an idea for every task or problem think about how a human would solve it then take the human solution and encode it as a set of rules for the computer we sometimes call this approach go fie good old-fashioned AI this plausible approach has been tried but unfortunately it has mostly failed the reason people are incredibly good at solving problems but incredibly bad at explaining exactly how they do it so what else can we do let's turn to the one living proof that human level intelligence is actually possible our own human minds I don't know what your experience is but in my experience when we learn we learn from experience when we apply that very idea to computer software we call it machine learning you can think of machine learning as a new way of programming a computer we don't feed it rules or instructions instead we let it learn from examples and experience hence for the remainder of the talk the protagonist will be an artificial learning agent that interacts with the world in three different ways it observes the state of the world it takes action in the world and it receives rewards for achieving goals the learning agents brain is an artificial neural network that's a computer architecture that's inspired by the human brain during training it learns by adapting the connections between its artificial brain cells the goal to take actions that lead to the greatest reward in the future so as an example for training let's take our best friend and learning agent the dog and cat lovers will understand why we're not using a cat here what would you do if you wanted to train your dog to sit on command first you lure it into a sitting position then you utter the command sit and then you reward it with a treat as you do this again and again the dog's brain learns by adapting the connections between its neurons to get the treat so artificial learning agents are trained in much the same way as this and that's what we call machine learning science-fiction you might be saying not at all the mobile phone responding to your voice commands your photos automatically tagged by content your messages translated into a different language online all of these systems have been trained by machine learning by feeding them examples not rules but for true artificial intelligence where will all the experience and the rich interactions to learn come from surprisingly we can find inspiration in Stefan Zweig famous book the Royal game the book tells the story of dr. B an innocent man who has been arrested and is being held in solitary confinement not unlike our learning agent dr. B is alone in a small world and starved for stimulation they did nothing to us other than subjecting us to complete nothingness for as is well known nothing on earth puts more pressure on the human mind than nothing one day while waiting for an interrogation dr. B manages to steal a book from one of his captors a book about the game of chess eager to engage his mind dr. B devours the book and learns to play chess he replaced the master games in the book again and again but after a while those games have lost their novelty desperate for further diversion dr. B attempts to play chess against himself but he soon realizes that in order to play chess against himself he needs to split his mind into two halves and I black and an eye white now only now with two agents in play can there be true interaction and learning years later on a cruise ship dr. B meets the world chess champion of the time one Mirko sent ovitch an expert at chess and only at chess in a stunning demonstration of his skills dr. B manages to do the impossible he wins at chess against the world chess champion fast forward 80 years and Stefan Zweig story becomes reality in a way that not even the author could have imagined the modern sent ovitch stockfish computer Chess Champion 2016 a good old-fashioned artificial intelligence for playing chess and only chess the modern dr. B alpha zero an artificial learning agent that learns to play chess solely by playing against itself and not just chess also the difficult games of shogi and go in a match of 1000 games alpha zero wins 25 times as many games as stockfish and according to former world chess champion Garry Kasparov it did so in great style indeed so how does alpha zero work as a zero is a learning agent that much like dr. B begins with zero knowledge about the game of chess except for the rules when it starts playing against itself it plays more or less randomly but at some point it stumbles upon a victory and that's when the magic starts happening I for zero begins to learn it learns by adapting the connections between its artificial neurons to make more successful moves more likely to be played as it becomes a better player it produces even better games from which to learn in only eight hours alpha zero learns more about the game of chess than had been learned in the past fifteen hundred years but can our learning agents go beyond pure competition and become team players after all we humans thrive on cooperation in order to find out we trained our learning agents on another game capture the flag in capture the flag players team up to capture the opponent teams flag while protecting their own in the video game players control the movements of their avatar and they can tag opponents here's a video showing how to capture a flag on the left you'll see the agent perspective and on the right you see a top-down view so run to the opponent base and pick up the flag then bring it back to your own base but in order to score you need to make sure that your own flag is at your own base at the time similar to alpha zero we train the learning agents by letting them play against themselves for me millions of games but the environment here is much richer than chess it's a 3d environment and the agents need to learn to cooperate as well as to compete and because our goal is generality we train them on a diverse set of maps with different teammates and against different opponents we were excited to discover that the learning agents learned some rather advanced behaviors for example they learn to defend their home base they learn to set up camp in the opponent base to wait to the flag there reappears so they can capture it and they learn to follow their teammates because then they can work together eventually the learning agents became stronger at the game than strong human players against the fixed pool of opponents the learning agents won 74% of their games as compared to strong human players who only one 52% of the games but what surprises the most was that the human players preferred to play with the artificial learning agents on their team they said they were simply more skilled and reliable but enough about artificial learning agents what have we as human learn learning agents learned so far may be that the pursuit of artificial intelligence is a more human endeavor than we thought after all we take inspiration from human intelligence when we say that the hallmark of intelligence is its generality we take inspiration from human learning when we say that intelligent agents need experience and not instructions and we take inspiration from human interaction when we emphasize that we need to train our learning agents together to overcome the nothingness that haunted dr. B in the story so to conclude using our own human intelligence maybe one day we can create true artificial intelligence a tool that not only plays games but that can help us tackle some of the great problems of our times with greater intelligence [Applause]","VdDmhOCw6J0":"[Music] so exact said I'm from deep mind applied group where I work on the team that applies deep minds research to machine learning and reinforcement learning deep Minds research in machine learning reinforcement learning - Google's products today I'm going to briefly talk to you about why we chose to use tensorflow how we use it and how it how it's helped us so the choice of a numerical computing platforms such as tensor flow is incredibly important to us it's how we express our ideas and it's the people into the piece of software our engineers and scientists spend most of their time interacting with the quality of that platform has a direct and significant effect on the quality of our work and the speed with which we can deliver results and there are several aspects to what we look for in that so from flexibility our researchers continue to concoct all these weird and wonderful networks which we're hoping to put into use usability using this platform has to be easy and natural simple things like getting some embeddings and passing them through a feed-forward network has to be trivial composing things should be easy we should be able to take all these components which people people are developing and knot them together to create new things we need to be able to reach into the guts of that network to see what it's doing and we need tools for visualizing and debugging what's going on the platform also has to be scalable we see this move towards increasingly more data increasingly larger networks trend on more powerful accelerators across multiple servers and the more that trend continues the better we need to be performant so training training machine learning models is the new compiler link cycle it often takes days or even weeks for us to get results which reduces the speed with which we can iterate and try new things so the faster it goes the faster we can develop it's also important at surf time where latency is a critical factor in what we can do we often have quite like quite tight latency boundaries the more performed the model ism more expressive and more computationally powerful models we can use which will give us the key accuracy games also with training performance matters because when we're training on real data at served time the speed with which we can train affects the freshness of the model which often has downstream effects on our accuracy at served time and finally production readiness we often send all this time doing research and evaluation experimentation of our models and when we finally come up with a good thing we want to get it into production as soon as possible to do live experiments and ultimately scale it up to all the traffic that we have so previously in mind our projects are all implemented in either torch or disbelief a tense flow began to mature and head towards its first open source release we started looking at it as an interesting thing in the applied group we began experimenting with it by trying a few new projects meanwhile the research team who have this very stable much-used codebase then is to think about began by carefully evaluating the suitability by reimplemented several existing projects based on the results of that we decided that tensorflow was the way forward and so we started to migrate so over the past year or so we've been working on that process and as of today most about code that we currently use is intensive oh and all the stuff the significant amount of stuff we're building from now on will be intensive low what's quite cool about this is we made this decision a year a year and a half ago and since then the tensorflow and the ecosystem around it has improved beyond our expectations so we're even more happy with this decision now than we were then so I'm going to spend the rest of my time talking a bit more specifically about how we use tensor flow and how it helps us and since I'm on the apply group I'll start there so one of the coolest things we've done recently is on optimizing the energy usage in Google's data centers this began when the technical infrastructure team came to us after seeing the alphago matches and wondered how we could use RL to control the data centers more efficiently so we work with them and we worked with and subsequently work with teams in Google brain to build models to control the cooling infrastructure briefly this is what a cold aisle in one of Google's data center looks like this is on the service some of them may be a running tensorflow and they're getting hot doing so so we have these fans at the back which pulled that cold air over the servers into this hot aisle where it travels down and is transferred into a water cooling system so here are some pipes and some pumps and the pipe to take the hot water from the hot aisle to the chillers on the roof and the cold water from those chillers back to the cold aisle and here's what those cooling towers look like they're just big fans which take the water and cool it down into the air so we've spent a while working on this off line we had to take into account safety we the model couldn't go and try random things otherwise we'd break you know billion-dollar data centers which is never great and we had to work out how to do a bit of exploration as well because if we just learned on the data which we had available the model would probably never learn to do anything more optimal than what the human operators had done so we iterated bit and when it eventually came time to experiment we turned it on and we saw this nice drop from my experience it's kind of rare to see something so defined and sustained like this so we were quite happy with it so we had this initial result and it came time to implement it because the data centers didn't really have the infrastructure set up to run and train and evaluate and verify machine learning models we had to write a lot of this ourselves so we did that we we took our original torch models and move them to tensorflow we built up all this training and validation and serving stuff but over the past year what we witnessed is a rise development in these high-level api's around tensile and components like tensile force serving which basically negates a lot of the work that we had to do which am a perspective is great because we'd rather focus on the modeling aspects and all this kind of infrastructure stuff [Music] so another example where tencel helped us is we previously had this system called gorilla which stands for general reinforcement learning architecture with some extra letters thrown in there and we wrote this initially to speed up training of dqn style agents so what this was was a framework built on top of disbelief we had the parameters of an agent stored across multiple parameter servers and multiple instances of that agent pulling the parameters from that parameter server and interacting with environments to get experience that experience was then stored in a distributed memory where multiple learners sampled from it to make updates to the model parameters and the whole thing kind of cycled around like that by doing it this way we could get more experience faster because we had multiple agents and we could learn possibly because we had multiple learners but offer more than speed of convergence we often saw that sometimes these models actually did better than models trained on single servers and we think that had something to do with um the breaking of correlations between the examples we trained on from time to time this also was one of the inspirations for the ATC training algorithm which researchers later developed so with the introduction of tensor flow we were able to basically deprecated this because much of the functionality is handled by dense flow or can be written from within tensor flow which is great because it's more time less time we need to spend on code and maintaining it and more time we can spend on their actual projects more generally since we've started using tensor flow we've seen a reduction across the board in the amount of X and ciliary work we have to perform and things are only getting better as tensor flow and ecosystem around it continues to develop so one of these is the high-level api's which are developing which take care of a lot of the work we previously had to do to start a new project to build a prototype to train it and evaluate it meaning we can spend more time on modeling it's easy to experiment with models in tensorflow and it's easy to put together a baseline and a couple lines of code it's easy to change things about it so for example if we have a bunch of embeddings from various time series do we want to concatenate the last ten of them together do we want to convert them do we want to pass them through an LS TM to get the state it's all just a couple lines of changes which is quite nice the distributed training helps us we can try more things quicker and sooner and finally once we've gone through all this work and we're excited and wanting to put the model into production ts serving kind of gets rid of a lot of the pain that was previously there so all this amounts to a quicker develops does the development cycle meaning we can support more projects we can experiment more and we can deliver quicker which is great and what's more we've yet to come across an instance in any of these collaborations with Google where tensorflow has not been suited to the problem we're working on hasn't been flexible enough which is great so I'm excited about the possibilities here and I hope we can tell you more about from this project soon so the apply team is only one part of deepmind and our friends and research are also busy doing lots of cool stuff and have begun to take advantage of tensorflow to do so so one of the obvious things and one of the most exciting moments for us last year was when alphago succeeded in a series of matches against ISA doll one of the greatest go players of the last decade what made this so exciting was it was a combination of a great technical achievement in making a stronger player but it also represented something of a new beginning in the game of Go interest boomed go boards sold out across the world which is interesting and players responded not with a sense of defeat but they were excited about it as a new beginning because they could work with these machines to explore more deeply the mysteries of this ancient game what a point alphago is one of the first significant users uses of temp to flow a deep mind where it was used to great advantage to train these networks powering Africa so I won't spend too much time talking about go itself just suffice to say it's a perfect information game with a very high branching factor and a lot of moves in a particular game so your standard minimax search obviously might work what the main component of alphago was composed to these two networks a policy network and a value network the policy network was trained to given a game State workout which moves the opponent was going to make and the value network was trained to give it a game set how like to predict how likely we were to win that game so naively well you could just use the value network to evaluate your next set of moves in practice that wasn't quite good enough for what we needed so we resorted to a bit of a compromise using a combination of using these nets with a Monte Carlo tree search to get better results and the way this basically works is if you do a full monty color search that's way too many possibilities so we use this policy network to guide the paths in this search tree to the most likely part and then at some point further on in one of those paths we'd use the value network to evaluate how good that path work was and we didn't have to go all the way to the end why the value network performed better in that case is because as we unroll these paths more of the game had unfolded and things are more so certain for the value network had a better prediction but the real thing where Templar came in was the training of this thing which is quite significant to quite a significant amount of work so we started by taking games from expert players and training this policy network and then we began this iterative process where we use reinforcement learning to train a value network from that policy network and then update the policy network to produce better moves previously doing this on torch it was slow and when we moved to tensorflow we were able to bring the whole power distributed training to bear on this which made it the whole thing faster meant our researchers could iterate quicker and try new things another cool thing from this year was wavenet which we used to generate realistic audio signals so this is hard in general because sound waves are this complex have this complex oscillating structure with a very high sampling rate on the order of 16 kilohertz generating an audio signal requires a model which is able to reproduce this sort of signal at both are very both these very fine-grained oscillations on the order of milliseconds and the whole signal over seconds which is difficult because of the amount of information so there were two main approaches to this previously concatenated models and parametric models so in captive model worked by having a speaker say a whole bunch of sound and chopping it up into little bits and then reassembling those to say whatever you wanted what we often that what you often see from these is the sound seems kind of choppy because these transitions between these sound segments don't quite match up it's also difficult to modify the voice they're adding a new speaker or altering the emphasis or emotion similarly there the other approach was parametric models of which wavenet is one where all the information required to generate speech is stored in the parameters of the model and you supply information about what you want to say and the characteristics of that as inputs to the model however prior to wavenet we noticed the parametric Texas speech tended to sound a bit less natural in cabinet models so wavenet changes the paradigm that was previously in parametric models by directly model modeling the waveform of the audio signal one sample at a time so as well as yielding more natural sounding speech by directly modeling the real way for form it means a wavelet can produce any kind of audio not just speech so the architecture for this evolved out of work on XLR n ends and equal cnn's which were used for generating images and the key piece of architecture here was the use of a dilation a delayed a dilated convolution with an increasing exponentially increasing stride as the Lay's increased what this allowed the model to do was to have a receptive field size that was exponential in the number of layers in the model which allowed it to incorporate all this information about the signal the other cool thing about the structure is that it in the first half of the input compared to the second half there are twice the number of connections meaning it it uses that information to a greater degree so here are some samples generated from the various systems so on the Left we have audio from a concatenative model to play the left one the Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romance in adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser so if you listen closely you can see some of the discontinuities in the generated audio due to the slight mismatches in the transitions between the different recorded chunks so in the middle we have a blue lagoon is the 1980 American romance and adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser which is less choppy but it doesn't have that natural quality we associate with the normal stage and finally we have wednet the Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romance an adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser which compared to the other two is very smooth and natural the only slight thing the wavenet does is it has a bit of noise due to the sampling procedure and in your network so maybe if we play them all again just so people can see yeah yeah just some leftovers right yeah the Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romance and adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser the Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American romance and adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser the Blue Lagoon is a 1980 American route so we compared webknight against other models through the use of opinions scores and what we found by human raters and what we found was that it narrowed the gap to human speech by about 50% which is great and because wavenet models they model the raw audio signal we can also get it to produce sound other than speech so here's an example where we trained it on a corpus of classical music [Music] as you can hear its able to generate go back home yeah thanks as you can hear it's able to generate realistic sounding piano notes on a moment-to-moment basis and finally with what must be one of my favorite paper titles of the year learning to learn by gradient descent by gradient descent in which some of our researchers trained a neural network to train a neural network which i think is a great example of the kind of flexibility that tensorflow offers and I think going forward we're going to see more of this kind of crazy out of stuff like with models learning architectures of models models adding bits and pieces to themselves and so on and so it's exciting to see that tensor flow can handle that and I know at least you must have deep mind the tensor flow is is going to be our choice of how we model these things going forward so if you're interested in more details you can look at our website did mundo calm there's a blog post linked here which rounds up some of the things from last year and we also have links to the over 100 papers that we published so far thanks for listening [Applause] [Music]","KpedmJdrTpY":"inside every cell of your body billions of tiny machines are hard at work they carry oxygen in your blood let your eyes detect light and even make your muscles move these machines are proteins and they underpin every biological process in every living thing each protein has an intricate 3d shape that defines what it does and how it works we know of over 200 million proteins and counting but we only know the exact 3d shapes of a fraction of these unravel a protein and you'll see it's like a string of beads made up of 20 different types of amino acids interactions between these amino acids make the protein fold as it finds its shape out of almost limitless possibilities for decades a community of scientists have been working on a way to figure out a protein shake just from its string of amino acids this is a major challenge in our understanding of biology so we created an ai system to solve this problem called alpha fold it's trained on the sequences and structures of about a hundred thousand proteins painstakingly mapped out by scientists around the world today it can accurately predict a protein shape just from its sequence of amino acids alpha fold's predictions could enable progress in all sorts of areas imagine a future where we can understand diseases more quickly and develop drugs to fight them or one where we could use enzymes to break down plastic waste or even to capture carbon from the atmosphere or with the help of proteins there's a lot more work to be done but unlocking the shapes of these building blocks could help scientists better understand the natural world and perhaps expand our knowledge of life itself","KF1KhuoX2w4":"good afternoon everyone it's great to be here I'm going to talk to you a little bit about today about a company called deepmind technologies that I started six years ago with some friends of mine our mission is to solve general intelligence and so this means building general-purpose learning algorithms so today I want to give you a little bit of a taste for what that actually means in practice and show you some of the real-world applications that we've been working on but first let me tell you about our company in our culture we are at heart a research organization we're based in Kings Cross up in North London we have about 200 or so of the best AI and machine learning researchers in the world we publish all of our papers published more than 100 peer-reviewed academic papers and a couple of years ago we were acquired by Google and we became google deepmind and these days we've been running independently from the mothership from the alphabet mothership and this is really important to us it was important when we were acquired that we were able to carry on the independence and the kind of strong culture that we had developed as a British company over here in London as we are and we've managed to preserve that I think over the last couple of years we also have in our heart a very strong social mission and I think what we've managed to do is combine the very best from academia with its focus on long term hard research questions that really get you thinking about what life should or could be like in 10 years time and bring that to bear in a very fast-paced culture that has the kind of scale and agility and of course resources of a large corporation taking the best of both worlds and trying to combine them together and all the while we're very much underpinned by I think the kind of social impact values of the public sector it's really important to us that we're able to work on applications that make the world a better place and at a heart that is what's really motivating us to try to solve general intelligence so as I said our mission is to distill the kind of essence of what has created all of this incredible civilization and and everything of value around us into an algorithmic construct our brains are incredibly powerful they create our social relations our economic systems our culture our art and somehow if we're able to represent the characteristics that make us unique as as human beings and make us distinct as a species represent those things in an algorithmic construct we might be able to do better job of planning of classification of search and really important things that make us unique but we want to solve intelligence so that we can make the world a better place and I think this is a really fundamental part of our mission that we've tried to integrate into the heart of everything that we work on so why do we think it's possible now to build general-purpose learning systems well I guess there's sort of two broad factors the first is to say that we've made incredible progress on the hardware and I think what is less well-known is that we're making incredible progress on algorithmic efficiency so let's start with what you'll all be familiar with massively faster computers back in 1990 a laptop just like this one costing about five thousand dollars if if trained on image net one of the classic tasks in training deep neural networks and when compared today to be trained on a laptop built in 2015 costing roughly around the same kind of money actually would have taken 270 thousand years to train on exactly the same task that today takes around three weeks which is kind of incredible so precisely the same algorithm trained on different Hardware over roughly a twenty year or so period and what this actually means is the search space for new algorithms is getting much much smaller so it means that we can almost brute-force the search for the optimal combination of algorithm because hardware is so so cheap we can train much bigger algorithms much much faster and so we can afford to search through the space of all possible combinations of algorithms now this is really interesting because combined with this we've also seen a massive improvement in the efficiency of the algorithm itself so let's take the classic chess computer system developed by IBM back in the day called deep blue and it be garry kasparov in 1997 searching 200 million moves per second and this was a very traditional system hardl almost call it an AI system given what we're doing with AI these days it was a handcrafted set of rules written by a bunch of expert grandmasters who essentially said if you find yourself in this position then it's most likely that you should take this set of actions it's a very structured relational database but it was very powerful and it obviously used brute force to search through 200 million moves a second and beat the world champion at chess but back in 2009 you know just a decade or more later pocket fritz a computer program running on an iPhone an early version of the iPhone actually won a professional tournament nine one nine wins to one against a master searching most importantly only twenty thousand positions per second so this is a ten thousand times speed-up over a 12-year period in the efficiency of the algorithm so when you combine this with the efficiency that we've seen in hardware these two things make it possible to Train really very different algorithmic systems today and what we're ultimately interested in is how we build general-purpose learning systems so I'm going to tell you a little bit about the kind of philosophy or the framework that we use to train these systems traditional AI approaches have focused as I said on very structured rule based learning that take the human intelligence as expressed in symbols or words and try to represent that in kind of boolean logic so if this then that and what we've what we've been very committed to do is to try to train an algorithm to learn its own representation of the world through interaction with some environment so all of our systems begin with the training of a machine learning system or an agent that agent has some goal which is defined by the human being and it's able to interact with some environment now you can think of this environment in very general terms it could be a robotic system interacting with a kitchen or a car manufacturing plant it could be YouTube where the environment is to try to recommend videos that people watch or it could be an energy grid and that environment is that agent is able to take a set of actions in the environment interact with it in some way by recommending a video on YouTube or controlling a robotic arm and then the environment passes back a set of state updates so after the interaction with the environment the the environment has somehow changed and so all the sensors that collect information about that environment send the updated observations back to the agent and it's through this process of interaction through reinforcement learning we're able to train agents to learn their own representation of what it takes to optimize some goal and right in the beginning we were very successful in training our algorithms on the old-school Atari testbed so many of you will be familiar with this it's like a hundred or so Atari games from the 70s and 80s and the environment is simply a set of raw pixels so at every frame we're passing back a set of RGB or red green blue values to the algorithm based on where that are right where that it's it's in a frame on on an X or Y X and Y axis and so really there's no pre-programmed knowledge everything is learnt from scratch so we're not hand coding any insight into the algorithm we're not saying this is what a color is or this is what motion and dynamics are or this is a paddle this is an enemy we're really saying given this set of pixels over time can you optimize your goal function which is to get more reward by tweaking the action buttons and so that is really all we give to the agent we just wire them up to the action buttons and give them the motivation of trying to optimize for score so really the best intuition is to think about a robot standing in an arcade being fed the pixels from the video screen and filling around with the joystick and the and the fire button in order to find out what the what the kind of association is between the set of actions it's able to take the set of pixels that it saw in the last few frames and the reward that it gets it's kind of just simple associative learning at one level so let me give you a sense for what this looks like this is the old game of breakout and here we are after a hundred games the agents just arrived in the environment so it really has no idea what to do it's sort of moving around left and right trying to explore the space and randomly discover what kind of actions seem to be rewarding after 300 games it seems to have learnt pretty well that there's a strong association between moving the baton to the right place to hit the ball back at the right time and this is pretty much human performance I mean this is sort of better than I can play but interestingly we left it training for 500 games overnight and it developed this really cool strategy where it tunnels the ball up the sides to get maximum points with minimum effort and this was super surprising to us as engineers because it was really cool in some sense because many humans don't realize that strategy when playing the game and it was something that emerged through the game through the agent interacting with the game on its own so it's really surprising to see the first signs that complex behaviors relatively complex behaviors can emerge without us handcrafting those features in so this was really exciting to us two and a half three years ago another example is the game of space invaders and so this is a video of before training you can see that it's getting killed all of the time it's sort of randomly firing around it doesn't realize that those things are denying it when when it gets hit by one of those missiles denying it from getting score it doesn't realize that when it hits one of the space invaders above it's actually getting reward and after training is learnt a whole bunch of really interesting dynamics so first of all you can see often hiding behind the orange obstacle because it knows that you know if it gets hit by one of those missiles is in big trouble and secondly you can see that it's actually often aiming at the top so it's trying to get those ones first because it gets more reward here we see the pink mothership and it does an incredible predictive shot to try and get that because it gets more reward for that for hitting that at the right time and the other thing is you can see that very rarely wastes bullets it's actually very precise and accurate and it can do really cool predictive shots just right at the end as you see to get the last enemy so it plays the game and indeed it plays 57 of the games to human or superhuman performance the same algorithm performing in a very general way across all of these different environments and the environments perceptually have very different physics very different objectives vary in some set in some cases long-term temporal dependent see so it's not really just reacting it's actually having to make a series of decisions and get them right in sequence over time we were very lucky enough to be awarded a nature paper for this and we managed to get the front cover back in 2015 which as many of you will know if you're academics is the prized possession for an academic research lab like ours we extended this work earlier in the year to the old classic ancient game of Go let me tell you a little bit about the game essentially the objective is to place stones on a 19 by 19 board and you're if you're white I'm black and the objective is to try and play stone such that you surround your opponent's territory so there's really no further rules than that it's very unstructured it's very abstract and there are no sort of tricks that help you to exploit structure in the space so in chess for example the pieces are worth different amounts and so you can focus all your energy on protecting your queen for example because it's really valuable or you don't have to bother about thinking you know can a pawn move five squares ahead because you know that's an illegal move whereas in the game of Go there's very very little structure and so the search space is really absolutely enormous it's a 3,000 year old game and believe it or not it's incredibly popular all over the world there are 40 million players worldwide and the really extraordinary thing that make it so difficult to play is that there are ten to the power of a hundred and seventy possible state spaces on a 19 by 19 board so just to give a sense of what this means it's a ten with a hundred and seventy zeros on describe the number of possible board configurations of a are possible in the game and it's been estimated that there are something like ten to the seventy so ten with seventy zeros after it atoms in the known universe in every liquid solid and gas in the known universe there are many many many orders of magnitude fewer possible atoms in the known universe than there are possible board positions in the game of Go so just impossibly difficult to ensure it and get your head around this is roughly what the branching factor looks like in go in chess rather a much much smaller and more structured space and so here there are something like 10 to the power of 40 possible board positions and so for every possible move there arise another set of moves that are possible and then another set and another set and this branch is out for about 100 or so and that roughly makes up 10 to the power of 40 or so possible board positions but this is what it looks like for there to be 10 to the power of 170 possible board positions at every moment there's an enormous number of positions that are possible the next move and so trying to model structure in a space that is so large is really very very difficult writing an evaluation function to know if you're in a strong position or a weak position is incredibly hard and so all of the top players essentially lie on rely on intuition and that branching factor that you see there goes on for 200 possible branches until you reach the end of the game so we trained two different neural networks that learn a representation of what is effective in the space the first is to basically say given a set of possible moves that might be valuable at this particular position how do I identify which one I should take so here what we see is at the green layer there's 10 different positions that have been identified and that network has been trained on past games a hundred thousand or so past games so we're learning from the very you know the very best of human knowledge to bootstrap our algorithm to start from at least the best that human knowledge has to provide and once a particular position has been identified the algorithm then trains a different network to search the value of that particular position and so we're trying to figure out the probability of winning if we roll forward this kind of from this kind of position and so both of these networks work in tandem with one another to to make a guess at what should which move should be taken earlier this year we played the world champion Lisa doll over in Seoul in Korea for a million-dollar live match our system alphago played Lisa doll and he was he is still the the The Legend of the game 18 world titles and is considered the greatest player in over the last decade we actually won the game which was super exciting we won four to one and widely recognized to be a decade earlier than expected and it created an incredible buzz so there were 280 million live viewers which is more viewers than there are who watched the Super Bowl which is sort of quite surreal given you know each game is about four or five hours long so it's kind of kind of intense 35,000 press articles and incredibly it caused the shortage of the sale of go boards which was also quite remarkable when you consider they're kind of bits of wood with some stones on top so and we're really excited about the buzz and energy that it created and again we were lucky enough to manage to get a nature paper and of course lucky to get the the front cover the first machine learning AI lab to get to nature front covers in eighteen months so it was really cool to be to be able to do that work but of course our real motivation is to develop these systems so that we can actually make progress on some of our most intractable problems that's what motivates us at deep mine that's what we're really driven by and in fact I think that in some ways is what makes our organization so exceptional I think the really smartest people in the world want to work on the hardest problems with some of the other smartest people but I think what's also really important and becoming really clear I think in the last five years at least is that those people have the freedom to work on any problem in the world they can go to any lab or to any company they can take their pick and so what really makes a difference is the opportunity to have meaningful social impact in the world and know that you are actually working hard to try to change the model of running an organization and change the motivation and purpose of our typical institutional structures and do things quite differently so we took the same kind of methods and we actually deployed them to see if we could make Google's data centers much more efficient what we did so we trained a model to look at all the past retrospective sensor data that describes how the data center operates and this includes data that things like air pressure temperature incoming server load and so on and so forth and what we're able to do is train a model to use power more efficiency efficiently to deliver exactly the same performance so there were no glitches I hope in any of your experience of watching YouTube or any of your search results but all the while we managed to deliver exactly the same performance by using 40% less energy in across all the data centers in order to cool the data centers and so this kind of is quite exciting because it gives us a hint that these kinds of very large learning methods can be used for very hard real-world problems and I think one of the things we're really excited about now is how we might be able to deploy these very general algorithms for load balancing on the National Grid and so these are really difficult problems in data centers where there's a massive action space and the real-world data is really really noisy and what we really need to do is design algorithms that can safely explore different parameters and in order to control very complex systems and so ultimately what we're excited about is the potential to use these same systems in any building to predict incoming load and adjust the energy required to operate that piece of infrastructure accordingly in order to sort of optimally match them to consume only the energy that is necessary at the right time to run say a massive cooling facility or an industrial plant or potentially even the National Grid the other thing I want to talk to you about is deep mind health earlier this year in February we launched our first business that sort of facing outwards looking at seeing how that we can deploy our technologies to radically transform the NHS digitized and then help better organize and run the National Health Service and at the moment the most remarkable thing that we discovered is that there is actually an incredible amount of really rich data that describes your experience when you're admitted in a hospital it's collected very diligently it's very comprehensive but the challenge is that it sits in charts like this at the bottom of your bed and so this is for example a fluid chart this is a record of thing that you've eaten that day and there's all sorts of very rich data that in some sense describes you and your experience in admission this is your stool chart this is a catheter chart coming up here and all kinds of really useful information that unfortunately is only really ever accessed by the clinician when they arrive at your bedside and so they spend the first couple minutes flicking through this information and basically asking you to repeat the stuff that you've probably repeated many times before to the previous specialties when were you admitted what's wrong with you who else have you seen that's really difficult for you as a patient to try to remember all of those things and have to repeat those things and present your own case history the other kind of data that exists is transmitted using pages it will be surprising I think to many people to realize that actually this technology which is many decades old is still in use as the primary mechanism of communication today in the hospital and the downside of these systems apart from the fact that they're very clunky and when you do get a message you have to go and find a telephone and phone back the person and they may or may not be on the receiving end of that phone but and then you end up paying pager ping with people and that's one of the downsides but the other is that none of the information that's exchanged when clinicians are communicating with one another is actually recorded and yet that's the most valuable information that describes what decision was taken when to diagnose you with a particular condition to decide that you need to undergo a particular procedure or a particular pathway of care and so that's kind of lost to the ether it's not recorded and it's not part of the information that that can be used then to audit or to improve or to strengthen the quality of service that you receive and I think this these two things contribute significantly to some really shocking statistics ten percent of patients experience some kind of harm some kind of unnecessary harm when they're admitted to hospital and around half of those patients it's been estimated suffer that harm largely because there's been a delay in the escalation of their care and that that essentially means there's been poor communication poor coordination and very limited access to data that should otherwise describe the kind of deteriorating condition that you're facing and actually a really interesting study came out earlier this year from the BMJ that has estimated that medical error is actually the third leading cause of death in the US and so everybody thinks that the numbers in the UK are very very sort of underestimated something like 250,000 people die a year preventive preventatively because of medical error in the u.s. it's the third biggest killer and so largely there's sort of two things that are driving the patient experience in hospital the first is how do we identify which patients are at risk of deterioration at any moment and there's two or three sources of data here there's the stuff that already exists on the very clunky and painful and old-school digital systems as well as the paper-based record and I think you'll be very surprising to most people although not many of the junior doctors and consultants and nurses who work in the systems just to to realize that actually a lot of these systems these desktop-based old-school systems that are in deployment at the moment were actually developed for completely different ecosystems so firstly largely in the US and secondly often originally those systems were built for logistics or accounting so not really designed for healthcare from the ground up thinking about the user need all the way through and so the first job is to take advantage of all the data that currently exists both both that which is digitized and that which needs to be digitized and then secondly use that to escalate care more effectively so once you've identified which patients are at risk of deterioration by looking all the data how do you manage the coordination of that intervention more effectively and so let me take you through an example of what a truly digitized healthcare experience might actually look like here we have our patient Robert who was admitted yesterday with a complaint of a severe abdominal pain and so he was kept in overnight for observations and our ward nurse Jamie is taking his temperature he's able to record the temperature on his mobile phone on his iPhone and it's really pretty simple he's able to swipe across update the number and immediately we see that the temper chair is actually thirty nine point two degrees and so this is obviously super concerning and it's generated what's called an early warning score which immediately triggers an alert to the doctor on call she is able to read that information in the lift and immediately realize that actually this patient needs to be seen by me very very quickly she swabs through on her mobile phone and looks up the name of the patient so there's structured search across all of the key features in the hospital she can search by consultant by ward by specialty she can search by medical record number or date of birth and here she's typing in the name of the patient so she can pull up Robert Jones and immediately view his profile so this for the first time aggregates all of the data that is being collected across the hospital system from the patient's perspective and so what she's presented with immediately is an overview what is this patient's allergies why have they been admitted in this current episode what are their underlying diagnosis you can see here that this patients had tonsillitis also suffers from asthma in the past had a tonsillectomy she can scrub down and see what medication they're on and she can see all of the observation said any other details that are relevant and most immediately necessary in the overview if she swipes across she can see a different stream of data she can see the linear timeline of everything that's happened to this patient in order so in the last few minutes she can see that this patients actually triggered a sepsis alert it looks like there may be a risk of a very serious infection they've got an acute kidney injury alert which means that they're probably dehydrated and their kidneys are at great risk we can see that they've been sent for Bloods the Bloods have been ordered and they've been taken but they've not yet been collected so she doesn't have to call down to the pathology lab to say is this blood test result ready she can immediately see on her mobile phone that actually this is a test that needs to be reviewed and examined she can also see other radiology reports and any other information she needs she can click on more detail to see every single blood test that's happened that's been taken about this patient look at trend analysis look at previous graphs compare that with all of the other important statistics so here you can see that the potassium has spiked this patient has dangerously high level of potassium rising six-point-two she can see that the white blood cell count is high which probably means there's an infection and was probably why that the sepsis alert was triggered in the first place she can also now having known that there's an acceptance risk go and look in more detail at that radiology exam where she can see that the report says that there's a right lobe pneumonia she can zoom in on that compare that to what she's seen before and share it with a colleague and get a second opinion and this has all happened before she's arrived at the bedside she has not even met the patient yet there's no need to arrive and look through the charts and then take a case history she's done all of this in the corridor in the lift and on her way there so that she's prepped and ready to give her full human attention to that patient at the bedside now she's here and she's been able to examine Roberts condition she context her consultant and say actually this patient looks like they might need an appendectomy they probably basically just need their appendix out and so her consultant can so now what we've enabled is effective escalation by by very fast real-time communication and her consultant can text back and confirm that actually this patient does need an appendectomy and we should start instigating all of the jobs and procedures and tasks both automatic and human that need to take place so here we see Jamie our ward no nurse texting back saying I'm gonna you know go ahead and do the blood cultures and so on and so forth so this is our consultant who's preparing for the operation she's got her own phone and she's able to tap on admit the patient and prepare them for surgery and automatically we see that a whole series of subtasks get dispatched across the whole hospital so we can see that this patient needs to be nil by mouth they need intravenous fluids someone needs to write up the antibiotics they need to be consented and so on and so far forth and so all these jobs get sent to the right person so that they can be carried out at the right time and obviously following Robert's operation we can still follow up with all of the live observations and results our clinician our surgeon can still read through all of the information that she needs to see from home and keep tabs and communicate with her team so that she can take care of the patient in a remote and ongoing way but ultimately what we really want to do is put the patient control the patient owns the data about her and we want to make that available on personal mobile device so that that he or she can play a much more active role in administering their care and potentially connect up other data sources to better manage their own conditions and I really believe that this kind of digitization has the potential to truly transform healthcare one of the big challenges that we face in the world today is of obesity and diabetes so 26% of prevalence of diabetes among adults in England is massively rising and you're much more likely in fact you're 25 times more likely to suffer some kind of sight loss if you do have diabetes and yet 98% of that sight loss is completely preventable if you can get in there early and detect it so these are preventable problems if we can get access to the data in real time and identify who's at risk of that so what we've been doing is working with the Moorfields Eye Hospital to look at these Oct scans so these are 3d videos of your eye if you like and one of the challenges that we have a 10x shortage of radiologists to actually review these images and so there's massive delays in detecting disease and this can lead to blindness and so what we really want to do is build algorithms that can learn to identify the early signs of age-related macular degeneration diabetic retinopathy and so on and so forth and so this is an example of the kind of segmentation that we train our algorithms to do and this I think will enable much more standardized analysis instant results with a continuously improving methodology and a scalable technology that can be deployed across the entire system we're also doing the same kind of thing for improving radiotherapy so that we can do a better job of detecting cancer care the same principle here is that we're really trying to make sure that the right radiotherapy treatment is given to the right patient at the right time and we can do that much more efficient efficient ly with algorithms but of course for us AI is about making remarkable progress and we really do need to think about the ethics and impact and so we've been working really under a set of principles about how we develop these technologies and the first is to say that we think the benefits of AI should have power everybody be available to everybody not some elite few who have access to the resources to buy these technologies we think that our research and development should be open and responsible and socially engaged and we believe that we really want to lead the way in establishing technical and governance best practices and so that so that we can avoid the most undesirable outcomes and we can create new kinds of organizations in some sense a semipermeable membrane where members of the public members of people who are in who are on the receiving end of our technologies can be involved in designing and governing our technologies and hold us accountable as we do that so if you're interested in contacting us and getting involved I really want to hear from you I'm actually hiring for my policy and ethics team at the moment my email is Mustafa M UST AFA at deep mind calm please email me and come and join our mission thank you you you"},"manual_text":{"7R52wiUgxZI":"the great pleasure for me to be here and\nthe lecture here um I don't know if you know that but there is really this close\nconnection between deep mind and UCL which started off by two of our founders\nThomas and Shane meeting as post doctoral fellows at UCL and then ending\nup founding deep mind so really at the very root of things deep mind and UCL\nare connected and I think it's great that we can celebrate that and and use\nit and by putting out this lecture series and and sharing these thoughts\ntogether I will only be the first of several lecturers here are all the\nlecturers within the series and you will get to know these people if you stick\nthrough their lectures and they have a lot of interesting and wonderful things\nto say and towards the end of this lecture I'm going to go through the\ntopics that they will cover and try to motivate them in the context of the\nlarger field of deep learning here's the plan for the lecture first wheeled self\nintelligence and and then we'll do some other things when I have the word\nsolving intelligence here that refers to the first part of deep minds mission\ndeep minds missions Hadley has these two parts first solve intelligence and\nsecond use it to solve everything else and well that is of course an audacious\nmission statement we do believe that it's a great North Star to guide our\nresearch and so far it it has created a lot of great momentum so I could talk\nabout deep learning in a very broad sense giving examples from all walks of\nlife but I'm sure you're familiar with most most of those and so I'll take a\nmore personal view a more deep centric view also because that's the\nwork that I can authentically speak about and so what I would like to do is\ngo through three case studies of successful deep learning applications to\nshow you the power of deep learning and to motivate you to study it further and\nin these three case studies a lot of things will come up that you might not\nunderstand at this point in time fully but then I can assure you that the\nsubsequent lectures will fill in those gaps and and make you appreciate what's\nhappening here so the first case study is alphago and alpha0 the second one has\na little more action to it learning to play the game of capture the flag and\nthe third one goes beyond games and is about folding proteins with alpha fold a\ndeep learning based system and it takes us into the realm of biology and science\nand then finally the last bit of the lecture I want to go over the the pieces\nthat the subsequent lectures will deliver and put them into a greater\ncontext to tell you what's out there and why it's worth learning about these\nthings so let's start with solving intelligence the hallmark of human\nintelligence is its generality and nobody has expressed this in a crisper\nway than the science fiction author Robert a Heinlein so he says a human\nbeing should be able to change a diaper plan an invasion butcher a hog Koerner\nship design a building write a sonnet balance accounts build a wall set a bone\ncomfort the dying take orders give orders cooperate act alone solve\nequations analyze a new problem pitch manure program a computer cook a tasty\nmeal fight efficiently die gallantly specialization is for insects now\nnothing accounts against insects because they are actually smart in their very\nown way and I'm not sure we have actually fully\nreached that level of intelligence yet but for the purpose of this definition\nthe idea is the ability to do a wide range of things well is a\ncharacterization of intelligence now my colleague Shane leg is very passionate\nabout the definition of intelligence so passionate that he sifted through over\n70 definitions of intelligence before he arrived at his own synthesis and his\ndefinition is intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a\nwide range of environments you see how that's connected to the Heinlein quote\nand to what we think of as intelligent behavior now why is this important well\nif we want to create artificial intelligence we better have some kind of\nidea how to measure success how to know when we have an intelligent agent now\nShane also has mathematics at his heart close to his heart and so he has a\nformal theory of this definition of intelligence and we will not go into the\ndetails but I would just like to point briefly pointed out so this measure of\nintelligence here on the left is a function of PI a policy where a policy\ndetermines what action to take in a given state now this measure of\nintelligence is expressed as the sum over environments and this term\nrepresents the breadth of all the things that an intelligent agent should be able\nto do and he formalizes this in the framework of algorithmic information\ntheory and so he talks about the sum over all computable environments now we\nneed some something that indicates success and that's this term here the\nvalue that policy PI creates in environment mu so how successful is that\npolicy or we expose it to that particular task or\nenvironment and here's this thing in the middle is a complexity penalty a waiting\nterm K of MU is the comic or of complexity of the environment mu and so\nwhat this says is that if this complexity is low then this term is\ngreat and if this complexity is high then this term will be smaller and so\nthe definition gives more weight to simple environments and then\nprogressively less weight to more complex ones of course there are many\nmore complex environments than simple ones and so it also acts as a\nnormalization now the notion of the value and the policy come from a\nframework called reinforcement learning and in many ways we think of it as a\nvery general purpose framework for AI the idea is that there's an agent and\nthe agent interacts with an environment and that environment poses some kind of\ntask or problem to the agent if you like and so the agent here represented as a\nneural net observes the state of that world and can then take an action in\nthat world and influence the world and once it has taken that action it\nreceives the subsequent observation what has happened as a consequence of that\naction and it receives the reward symbolized by the star here is there\nsome kind of positive impact on the agent some measure of success and the\ngoal of this agent is to learn a policy you know the PI from the previous\ndefinition such that it maximizes long-term reward so ideally it doesn't\njust go for the immediate reward but it it plans ahead it tries to act in such a\nway that in the long term it will be successful in this environment now the\nbeautiful thing is that this framework is so general some people would say\noverly general that it encompasses things like unsupervised learning and\nsupervised learning as special cases but if you want to learn more about it\nthere is actually a module that colleagues of mine are teaching at UCL\nhere on reinforcement learning so this framework will be important going\nforward in those first two applications of deep learning that I'm going to talk\nabout and the reason is that the combination of deep learning and\nreinforcement learning we also refer to it as a deep reinforcement learning is\nsuch a powerful combination that we can use to solve interesting interactive\nproblems out there in the world now we started a lot of our work with games and\nyou might be aware of the work on atari games very early on and why do we do\nthat well first of all games are a bit like\nthis reinforcement learning you know you interact with this world and try to\nsolve problems really often they're a microcosm of the real world if you think\nabout typical games you know they are about value monopoly is about money and\nbuying and selling and chess is about has spatial dimensions and time built\ninto it and disease is a war game they have been designed to stimulate\nintelligence the designers of this game specifically want to stimulate human\nintelligence so clearly they must have some aspect to them that is is of\ninterest when we want to build intelligence the great thing is we can\nsimulate games you know we can set up simulations large-scale computer\nsimulations and and learn very quickly by playing these games and finally games\nare great for us to measure progress because often there's some kind of\nwinning or score or success measure associated with games they just think of\nvideo games with the little score indicator you know you want to ramp up\nthat score that's great that's a way of measuring progress and in the context of\nour L of reinforcement learning it can also serve as a reward so that's what it\nlooks like then if we apply deep reinforcement learning to a game in this\ncase pong you know the ideas are the same the agent observes the environment\nand take actions and then the score here is the\nreward that the agent gets the reward that is trying to maximize in the long\nterm and then in deep reinforcement learning the policy here the thing that\ndecides in a given state what action to take drastic up drastic down and so on\nbased on seeing this pixel image in this case that is parameterized by a neural\nnetwork whose parameters were trying to adapt so that the agent has success in\nthe long term for example optimizing long term discounted reward so in this\nparticular application my colleagues ran these reinforcement learning algorithms\nover close to 50 different Atari games and achieved superhuman level in a lot\nof these games really by putting the controller into the hand of the\nreinforcement learning algorithm letting it play these games observing the screen\nif you like the pixels on the screen and training the system to maximize reward\nor game score in these games and I just want to use this as an example for how\nto think about Shane's definition you remember there was the sum over\nenvironments and the value that the agent generates in these environments\nnow think of the set of environments as these games and then if we have an\nalgorithm that can do well in all of these games then according to Shane's\ndefinition we might be tempted to call that agent to have acquired some degree\nof intelligence of course not anywhere close to human intelligence but you know\njust that ability to solve many different tasks to a high standard as\nthe hallmark of intelligence okay so what's the role exactly of deep learning\nhere well in previous machine learning work prior to the deep learning wave if\nyou like for every problem that you wanted to solve with machine learning\nyou first need to define features that describe the state of\nthe problem you know for documents that would be bag of words features and for\nvisual problems that would be particular filters that people defined edge\ndetectors and so on and the new thing with deep learning not new now but you\nknow it was back then is to enable end-to-end learning to put the raw\nfeatures the pixels near the raw description of the problem in and learn\nthe desired input output mapping just given the loss how you measure success\nand the architecture of your neural network that's really what I would call\nthe the definition of deep learning now one beautiful thing about deep\nlearning is that through the architecture we can put prior knowledge\ninto the solution of our problem and that makes learning easier in other\nwords it requires less training data if we can do that and hence also less\ncompute and we will talk a little more about this later but this prior\nknowledge could for example be about space and be about time those basic\nkunti and notions if you like now what makes deep learning possible and\nattractive now I would argue it's the great computational power that we have\navailable now GPUs TP use and so on it's the large amount of data that we now\nhave generated by mobile devices online services distributed sensors labels\ngenerated by crowdsourcing by people if you like and finally our better\nunderstanding of algorithms and architectures and there's a great\nopportunity here because a lot of these algorithms are out there you know\nthey're an uncute hub you can download them and play with them and a lot of the\npapers are an archive you know as soon as they're written people upload them on\nthe archive and there's a huge repository of information there to get\nstarted in deep learning good ok I would like to move on now to these case\nstudies and start off with alphago and alpha zero some of you may have heard\nabout these projects and so I hope I can deliver some some more details on these\nand give you the general gist the core paper that I want to talk about is this\npaper a general reinforcement learning algorithm that masters chess shogi and\ngo through self play learning with my great colleagues David silver tomorrow\nbear Julien Schmidt feasor and Eunice and no blue and others what you see here\nis the scene where were ad job who we also call the hand of alphago\nbecause he acts as alpha goes hand where he plays and here lee sedol on the other\nside in this 2016 match which was captured in in this Netflix documentary\nthat you might want to check out if you haven't seen it so what's the problem\nwith go go is a beautiful game complex with beautiful strategies doesn't take\nlong to learn but a lifetime to master and the problem is that there are so\nmany different moves in any given position the 361 vertices on which you\ncan take turns to place black and white stones to surround territory and there's\njust so many different ways in which games can develop and that's where deep\nlearning kicks in and in particular we use two neural networks to reduce the\nsize of the search space the space of possible games in which we need to do\nour planning the first one we call the policy network and the policy network\ntakes as input a raw goal position you're now characterized by empty black\nand white points on this 19 by 19 grid and maps it to a probability\ndistribution over moves so given a go position this thing is a probability for\neach move being played in a particular position now we have a second neural\nnetwork we call the value network and the value network also takes a given\nposition but it just produces one number basically the evaluation of that\nposition is this position good for black or is it\ngood for white and how was this trained in alphago well we were lucky we had\naccess to a lot of human game records that people had recorded from very\nstrong players and so the first thing we could do was imitation learning we could\nuse deep learning to learn the policy network to really just learn to imitate\nthe human players and that gave us the weights for the policy network you know\nthe network observes a position it observes the professional or the highly\nskilled move played in that position and now it's a simple mapping from the input\nboard representation to that label if you like now at that point we had a\npolicy network that was able to play in a similar way to very strong human\nplayers it could imitate them so we could use that neural network to very\nquickly generate more games and so we generated a lot of games that then\nallowed us to train the value network because what the value network requires\nis an again an input representation for the board and the outcome of the game\ndid black win or did white win and from very many such pairs it can then learn\nthe probability for any given position for black or white to win and this is\nalready a form of reinforcement learning because we're learning the value\nfunction that I talked about earlier now how do we use these neural networks they\nactually use them much in the way that humans would use their intuition when\nthey approach the game the problem is there's this huge search tree when you\nexpand from a given position all the different ways black can play than all\nthe counters by white and black and white and so on it's a huge search space\nand it would be hopeless to just try and plan within that space if you didn't\nhave any guidance but these two neural networks they give us that guidance the\npolicy network allows us to be smart about the moves that we choose we don't\nneed to check out all the moves that start from this position\nwe can focus on the promising ones on the ones where the professional or\nstrong go player would be likely to play and that biases the search in the right\ndirection now the problem that remains is that the game tree is still very deep\na typical game of go can last 200 moves 250 moves even longer sometimes so how\ndo we deal with that that's where the value net comes in because we don't need\nto go all the way to the end of the game to observe its outcome if black wins or\nwhite wins we can stop somewhere in the middle after a few moves and use the\ntrained value network to give us an estimate of how good the position is for\nblack or for white and so together the policy network and the value network\nreduce the size of this huge search tree and allow us to traverse it and find\ngood plans in it and that's what alphago does and it worked we weren't always\nsure it would work but in 1968 in 2016 we had the match against isa dal a\nphenomenal 9dan professional go player from korea and at that point no program\nhad ever beat a professional player at that level in a match and in a very\nexciting match alphago ended up winning four games to one and if you want to\nshare that excitement I really recommend that you take a look at this Netflix\ndocumentary alphago which details our paths there and and also the drama of\nthe match good so much for alphago but we weren't quite happy with that because\nalphago go is just one game right and so we said that intelligence requires us\nthe agent to be able to solve more than one game maybe three games you know not\nmuch but a little better and so I'd like to talk about alpha zero and and how\nthat managers not only to play two more games but also use much less\nhuman knowledge because remember alphago was still using those professional game\nrecords and also some some additional features that we had designed and so\nwhat's interesting is that a short story by Stefan spike the Royal game can give\nus some insight into how alpha0 approaches the SPRO this problem\nyou see here on the right Stefan's like the author and the book tells the story\nof dr. B an innocent man who has been arrested and is being held in solitary\nconfinement not unlike our learning agents that the B is alone in his small\nworld and starved for stimulation I quote they did nothing other than\nsubjecting us to complete nothingness for as is well known nothing on earth\nputs more pressure on the human mind than nothing while waiting for an\ninterrogation dr. B manages to steal a book from one of his captors a book\nabout the game of chess eager to engage his mind dr. B devours the book and\nlearns to play chess on a makeshift board in his cells he replaced the\nmaster games from the book over and over again but after a few weeks the games\nfrom the book have lost their novelty desperately looking for further\ndiversion dr. B attempts to play chess against himself but he soon realized\nthat he can only play against himself if he splits his mind into two halves and I\nblack and then I white only now with two agents in play through interaction and\nlearning can happen later on a cruise ship dr. B meets the\nworld chess champion of the time when Mirko sent ovitch an expert at chess and\nonly at chess in a stunning demonstration of his skills dr. B\nmanages to do the impossible he wins at chess against the world chess champion\nnow fast forward 80 years and Stefan Sykes story becomes reality in a way\nthat not even the author could have imagined and he could imagine a lot the modern center which stock fish the\nworld computer Chess Champion 2016 a good old-fashioned AI for playing chess\nand only chess the modern dr. B I would argue alpha0 an artificial agent that\nlearns to play chess solely by playing against itself now here you see some\nresults as white alpha zero wins almost 30 percent of its game against his games\nagainst stock fish and as black it manages to draw most of the time and\neven wins the humor games then stock fish does you have to imagine stock fish\nis an is a good old-fashioned AI a program that has been designed by people\nby chess experts and so on and uses an enormous number of heuristics to cut\ndown the search tree and uses all kinds of domain knowledge about chess now here\nyou see the development over time as alpha zero trains this is the route\nthese are thousands of steps and you see here the e low number that's how we\nmeasure success here and after roughly four hours of training alpha zero\nsurpasses stock fish in its chess skills so how does this work the trick of\ncourse is a form of reinforcement learning and self play as you may have\ninferred from this story alpha zero is also all alone in some sense playing\nchess against itself and here's how it works\nso initialized with the policy and value network alpha zero plays by evaluating\nthe search tree from a given position in making its best move then taking that\nnext position again taking policy and value net and tree search to evaluate\nits net next move and so on and so forth it plays in place in place and generates\na lot of games at its current level of chess which is very low at the beginning\nbecause it's just starting and P and V there are at this point almost random\nbut then now we have games generated and we can train the policy network because\nnow we have a position and we know which move was made and we can train the\npolicy network to imitate that move we can do that for the next position and\nthe next position and so on the move made by alpha zero previously is the\nlabel from which the policy network learns it's basically imitating itself\naugmented by search similarly we can train the value Network and predict the\nwinner of these games because we know those games we've played them all the\nway to the end so for a given position we know how it will end and we can train\nin your network that estimates that now finally we put these new policy and\nvalue networks into the tree search and generate new games let alpha zero play\nagainst itself but now at a higher level because the new policy network and the\nnew value network are better and hence together with the tree search they\ngenerate better moves and we can generate higher quality games of chess\nthat's how it works and it actually works not only for chess but also for go\nand for shogi and these are just comparisons to how long it takes to over\nto reach the levels of the more traditional kind\ntenders for being the best programs in this space now one thing that I found\nvery interesting is how does alpha zero reason about chess positions in order to\nappreciate that you need to understand that a classical chess program on the\nleft evaluates tens of millions of positions before it makes a remove it\nexpands the tree to that many nodes now alpha zero only expands about tens of\nthousands of positions less by a factor of a thousand\nso it's search is much more focused and of course that still a far cry from how\nhuman grandmasters operate because they only evaluate hundreds of position their\nintuition for chess is so great that they are very good at both selecting the\nlines they look at and evaluating the resulting positions but you see here\nthat in some sense we've made a move from this brute force approach towards\nthe smarter way of solving these problems that humans employ one thing I\nlike is that we actually discovered some chess knowledge here or not we actually\nalpha zero did you know for example traditional openings like the English\nopening was discovered by alpha zero and it continues to play it there's there's\nother openings that are also known to humans that are discovered\nbut then discarded you know not good enough alpha zero understood that that\nline although it's been played by humans for a long time you know just not good\nenough I want to give you one example of play of alpha zero this is my favorite\ngame it's called the immortal souped swung game super strong is a german word\nthat indicates a situation in which it's not actually advantageous for a site to\nmove but they'd rather stay still and do nothing but the rules of chess don't\nallow that so what you see here is alpha zero as white and stockfish as black and\nyou see here that whites pieces are very active and black is very crammed into\nthis corner with the Queen in the corner blocked by that rock the King also\nblocked in these two rocks protecting that porn it doesn't\nlook good and now we can take a look at which moves actually or which pieces\nblack cannot move in this situation and the tragedy of the position if you like\nis that moving any of these pieces leads to a loss for black and so you see that\nalpha zero has a real appreciation of these positional advantages the mobility\nof the pieces and and dominating the board okay let's conclude the learning\nhelps us conquer this huge search space and self play produces the large amount\nof data that we need to train these deep neural networks there's also another\nthing at play which we call an automatic curriculum because you know at the at\nthe beginning the system starts to play in a very weak fashion and as it becomes\nbetter its opponent also becomes better and so it always trains against opponent\nthat's just of the right level because it's training against itself and that\nautomatic curriculum leads to stronger and stronger play and the system\ndiscovers new knowledge which i think is is a beautiful property of AI systems\nthere's still many open questions it's just a game and relatively small spaces\nas opposed to real world situations but it's an interesting first step there's\nmore material that you can look at if you're interested now let's move to a\nmore action filled game learning to play the game of capture the flag this is\nbased on a recent science paper with max jailer burg Wojtek Ronettes key and in\nDunning and it's about playing the game of capture the flag so it's a large\nscale a decentralized multi agent learning problem because capturing the\nflag is an objective game where multiple agents need to learn to interact to play\nit well and you see here a first-person perspective and here a top-down view of\na typical game situation how does this game work well this we\nplay it as a 2v2 game the you go run to the opponent base and pick up the flag\nyou want to bring it back to your own base but you need to make sure that when\nyou capture it that your own flag is at your own base let's take a look at this\nfrom the game's perspective here this is the agent perspective and this is the\ntop-down perspective and you'll see how this game works so you see the blue\nagents there they're going to the towards the red flag and capture it and\nthey want to now bring it back to their own base and the trick is that you\nreally need to have your flag at your base to score and that's that's why you\nneed coordination for example now their flag has been stolen by the red agent\nand so they need to tag that red agent and get their flag back before they can\nscore score a flag of their own now the types of environments that you see here\nwe have - we have an outdoor version you know one that's placed in some kind of\ndesert setting and here we have an indoor version we wanted to show that\nthe system can handle these two types of very different terrains and specifically\nwhat's interesting here is we use procedural generation whereas you and I\nwe would probably play this game on the same map every time or maybe it just\nchanged maps a few times what we require the agents to do here is to play on a\ndifferent map every single time and here you see a sample of these maps they all\nlook different and what that does is when the agents learn to play on these\nvaried maps they learn to generalize they learn robust strategies that work\nin all kinds of maps rather than just rote learning a particular map and so\nthe trick is also to train a population of agents and you see here our training\nsetup there's a population of agents down here and they connect to what we\ncall arenas each one of these is a little game simulation and some sample\nof these this population connects to the games for agents to on blue side to on\nred side they play they learn they get feedback they win or they lose and then\nthat stream of experience is routed back to those agents and that's where the\nneural networks are updated and they learn and they are trained pretty much\nindependently other than through their interaction in the arena\nKirsten you're a network architecture that we use it's a two level hierarchy\nof recurrent neural networks a fast one and a slow one so we can cover different\ntimescales and it also learns about the reward signal because this problem is\nvery difficult if you only ever get a reward signal at the end you know you\nimagine you play a five-minute game of capture the flag and in the end someone\ntells you oh you just won or you just lost and you now need to figure out\ngoing back in the game what was it that made me win or what was it that made me\nlose wouldn't it be much better if you had some intermediate rewards like oh \"I\njust tag the opponent that must have been a good thing\" or \"I just got the flag\noff the opponent\" and so that's what happens at this top level when we learn\nthose rewards we also use a population of agents because that allows us to get\nsome robustness towards different playing styles different agents learn to\nplay the game in different ways and so when agents train against these\ndifferent agents they again need to develop robust strategies in order to\nsucceed in this game so here you see the results and again we measure agent skill\nin elo so the higher it is the better and this is how they develop over time\nyou see here this is the baseline a random atrum that doesn't do much it's\njust chittering about you know randomly naive self play doesn't quite work as\nyou can see here it's almost as bad as the random here is the baseline of an\naverage human and here's the baseline of a strong human and you see that the\nagent the deep learning aid redeveloped in this work learns and learns and\nlearns surpasses the average surpasses the strong human and ends up\nwith a much higher skill than all of them now one thing that we found\nparticularly nice is when we test it with humans we also let them fill in\nsome questionnaires and we asked them so which ones of your teammates was most\ncollaborative you know with whom could you work the best and it turns out that\nthe human players indicated that they liked it best to play with the AI big\nyou know they found it reliable and strong and you know they wanted to play\nwith the AI so a nice finding now I'd also like to use this example to show\nyou something that is maybe a little underappreciated and it's the idea of\nunderstanding how these trained agents that behave in these arguably quite\nclever ways in these environments represent the world and in order to do\nthat we've here done a tease me embedding like a two-dimensional\nembedding of the internal states of the agents as they play this game and we can\ncolor the points by our knowledge of the game situation for example here we know\nthat this these points represent situations in which the agent flag is at\nthe base the opponent flag is at their base and the agent is in their home base\nyou know we know that because we can look at the game but the agents also\nknow that you know they know that this is a particular type of situation and\nthey represented by internal activations that are all similar to one another and\nthat are different from a different situation like here where the agent flag\nis taken the opponent flag is held by the teammate and so somehow in their\ninternal representations they've learned what a given situation is like and as a\nconsequence they can use that to make the make good decisions about how to\nplay in those situations and good decisions they make here are some\npatterns of behavior that we've observed and here for example home base defense\nthey try to defend their own home base they sometimes camp in the opponent home\nbase you know they just wait there until the flag responds and\nthey can they can steal it or they can follow the teammate and really just work\ntogether in in the same area and it turns out that this most advanced agent\nis actually most similar in playing style to to the humans that we observed\nplaying and I just want to emphasize there's a whole dimension of research\nout there where we not only train these systems but we look at their internal\nrepresentation how do they represent the world and we look at their behavior and\nreally understand how they solve the problem so that we can learn from that\nbut also ensure that they behave in safe ways for example if it's a safety\ncritical problem good now we've seen that in the in this more complex\nmultiplayer game the agents can clearly reach human level it takes a lot of\ncompute to achieve that no doubt training populations is important\nbecause you want a diverse training signal and the self play that still\nworked for alphago for alpha zero didn't actually work here because they just\nlearned one strategy and there wasn't enough diversity and robustness in there\na second thing of course that makes things robust is that we have diversity\nof environments because they we procedurally generate them and we can\nbegin to understand how these agents behave and write this papers and blog\nposts on this that you can read to pick up more detail now as the third case\nstudy I would like to go beyond games and talk about how we can use deep\nlearning to learn to fold proteins and the particular project I'll talk about\nis called alpha fold and the paper is called improved protein structure\nprediction using potentials from deep learning and is worked by my colleagues\nAndres senior Richard Evans John jumper and James Kirkpatrick and many others so\nwhat is this about what is this protein forwarding\nfirst let's understand what proteins are some of you may know more about this\nthan I do and but here's the gist there are the fundamental building blocks of\nlife they carry out all kinds of functions in our bodies they catalyze\nreactions they transduce signals across the cell membrane they regulate genes\nthey do cellular transport they they provide antibodies and they're very\nimportant for clinical drugs often they are the target of particular drugs but\nalso many drugs are proteins and the key thing we need to know to understand the\nprotein is its shape what the shape of a given protein on the right here you see\nthis amazing animation of proteins in action and you can see they really act\nas molecular machines you know then they can fulfill an amazing diversity of\nfunctions in the body depending on their shape now the interesting thing is that\nin some sense the specification of a protein is just a chain of amino acids\nit's it's a sequence of amino acids from an alphabet of 20 different amino acids\nand what happens is that these amino acids they interact locally to form\nthese shapes for example HeLa C's or sheets and then these HeLa season sheets\nthey interact more globally to form the 3d shape of the overall protein and then\nproteins can interact to do all of these amazing things now the the problem that\nwe want to solve is that of protein structure prediction and you have to\nimagine that these proteins they have a backbone it's basically the kind of the\nmain chain that determines their shape and they have these little side chains\nthat that influence how these how this backbone interacts with itself as it\nfolds back on itself and if we can figure out from the sequence you know\nthis is the sequence of amino acids what the 3d shape of the protein is then we\ncan understand what this protein does because it acts when it's in this 3d\nshape you can also imagine that if we have a shape in mind that we want to\ncreate it would be really good to have this kind of mapping available because\nthen we could invert it and from the desired shape device the sequence of\namino acids that we would need to create in order to build the thing that falls\ninto that particular shape it's known as the inverse problem now how can we think\nabout the shape of these proteins the goal really is to predict for every atom\nin this protein exactly where it ends up when it folds but one way of\nparameterizing this is through the torsion angles and once we have all\nthese 2n torsion angles which are the angles how these different bonds connect\nto one another then we know the 3d shape just imagine if you wanted to determine\nthe shape of these things someone told you which way they rotate at each point\nand you would be able to figure out where they are so those are the\nparameters that we're looking for once we have these angles then we should be\ndone but there's a paradox and that is called Leventhal paradox and it's\nbasically the following many naturally occurring proteins fold reliably and\nquickly to their native state despite the astronomical number of possible\nconfigurations so how if there are so many ways in which these things can fold\nhow do they find the right way so that they end up in exactly the shape that's\nnecessary in their living organism and I've done a little example here so\nsuppose we have a chain length of 361 amino acids\nand just at any point there are three different ways in which they could fold\nthen we would have three ^ 361 is roughly ten to the 172 configurations in\nwhich they could fold now imagine these proteins can wiggle really quickly and\nthey can explore ten to the thirteen different configurations per second or\nten to the twenty per year that seems like really quick search through that\nspace right but it would still take 10 to the 152 years to sample all the\npossible configurations it's a huge space and for those of you who know the\ngame of Go I have chosen 361 is the example on purpose here because that's\nthe number of vertices and a go board and three ^ 361 is an upper bound on the\nnumber of legal go positions of all the kind of ways in which you can have a go\nposition and John trump actually calculated how many legal positions\nthere actually are in go and you see I tend to get sidetracked to go because I\njust love the game and he represents that number as a ternary number and a\nternary number because any of these points can have three states empty black\nor white can be represented as a go position and so this is the go position\nthat as rare if you read it as a ternary number represents the number of legal\npositions in the game of goal now you might be wondering is it a legal\nposition it is an illegal position you know there's a black stone here where it\nshouldn't be and another one here and that's actually accurate because the\nmajority of these configurations of a go board are in fact not legal positions\nbut back to $11 per adducts there's a huge search space but we know that deep\nlearning can do something about deep search spaces so let's do that so why do\nwe want to use deep learning for protein folding there are experimental methods\nof course to determine the structure of of proteins but it's a very difficult modeling\nproblem we have data available 150,000 proteins in the protein data bank which\nwas founded in 1971 so this is a long ongoing process but we have much less\ndata than for some of the other tasks like speech recognition or image\nrecognition so it's a little harder there's another advantage there is CASP\nwhich is an assessment some kind of competition that provides a benchmark\nfor protein folding so there's a way of testing how well a system does so what\nshould we predict it turns out that the 3d structure of such a protein is fully\ndescribed by a dispair wise distance matrix so if you have all of these\npoints in space if you know all the pairwise distances between them then you\nknow what that configuration in space looks like and so the main thing that's\nbeing predicted in this system is this distance matrix conveniently it looks a\nbit like an image and you know images we're good at at addressing with deep\nlearning here's how the Alpha fold system works the sequence comes in here\nand we generate certain features from databases so it's not quite just using\nthe raw data but it's pulling in features about these sequences from\ndatabases and then it does its distance predictions also some angle predictions\nand it produces a score function and this score function is a number that\nmeasures for a given forwarding configuration for that sequence how good\nthat foldings configuration is and it's differentiable and if it's\ndifferentiable we can do gradient descent and we can optimize it and\nthat's really the key idea behind this work I will not go into the details of\nthis deep dilated convolution convolutional residual network but my\ncolleagues in the future lectures will discuss\narchitectures in greater detail and you will have no trouble understanding\nwhat's going on here once you've been through their lectures\nthat's just one thing be said it's a very very deep neural network with 220\nof these blocks one after the other good how accurate are the predictions\nthe first thing we can compare is ground truth of this distance matrix with the\nestimates of the system and we find that the system does a good job at capturing\nnot only short term interactions but also long long-range interactions and\nthen we can compare the foldings themselves and these are good examples\nwhere the folding worked well but you can see here that blue which are Alpha\nfalse predictions and green are reasonably well aligned so it the system\nunderstands the gist of these proteins and and how they forward the second step\nis this gradient descent that we can do now that we have a potential and energy\nfunction if you like that we want to optimize we can use gradient descent on\nthese angles and and just wiggle down in these in this configuration space and\nthere you see that here in action it's literally optimizing the coordinates of\nall the different bits and folding in the process trying to optimize the score\nthat has opted that it has estimated to be a good potential for this problem\nyou started multiple times to discover local optima but overall it's a gradient\ndescent operation now I said earlier that one reason this was such a nice set\nup for deep learning is that there's a good assessment exercise and this is\ncusp in this case calves 13 and it is a it is a competition in which there are\n82 chains that fold into some 3d structures but they are not known to the\ncommunity yet they're kept secret and so these chains are released one chain per\nday for a period of time and then the participating teams have three weeks to\nreturn five guesses or predictions of what they think that particular chain\nwill forward into and it's a very popular\ncompetition over 90 groups from different labs across the world\nparticipate and then they have a particular scoring mechanism which boils\ndown to measuring how close the predictions are to the to the ground\ntruth that has been determined by those experimental techniques and this is a\nfantastic piece of work designing this competition and were indepted two\ndecades of work here of those people who run the competition or the participants\nbut of course also those people who do with the experimental work of producing\nthis data because that's hard work some people estimate that for some proteins\nit takes an entire PhD thesis to get the 3d structure and entire PhD thesis\nthat's a lot of work ok so here are the results these are the different teams\nthat participated and in fact the deep learning system comes out as the best\nperforming system in this in this exercise so this deep learning based\ndistance prediction clearly works it gives more accurate predictions of\ncontact between residues although it estimates distance previously a lot of\nsystems used contact when they're close enough to go to one another\ncloser than a test rooms but it also delivers richer information because you\ncan imagine this is there's more information in a distance than in the\nbinary signal or if something is together or further apart right we have\nmore information and finally because it's a smooth prediction and we get\nthese distances it's real numbers it's also a smoother potential that is easier\nto optimize and we see that's why the gradient descent for finding the right\ncar configurations works there are many limitations still of course the a\ncurious accuracy of the system is still limited it doesn't work so well on some\nsome proteins or protein templates the method depends on what we pull out of\nthat database so only because there's a database of\nstructures can we get the features that allow us to make those predictions and\nalso it only predicts the backbone and we then use a tool called Rosetta to\nfill in the side chains so it's it's one small step in in a problem that has been\nthought about and worked on for many decades but it shows that deep learning\nhas something to contribute to these problems in science and specifically in\nbiology good so that was the three case studies that I wanted to present alphago\nthe classic if you like with its extension into alpha zero a board game a\nvideo game the game of capture the flag with more players more richer\ninteractions harder to process visuals and so on and finally an example from\nthe world of science where deep learning can really make a contribution to\nscientific progress in a field where that matters because it might help\ndevelop new new cures now I'd like to use the rest of the time to give you an\noverview of the field of deep learning by going through the different lecture\ntopics that my colleagues are going to talk about and here they are and we\nstart with number two because we just in the process of doing number one the\nfirst lecture away after this one is on the foundations of neural networks and\nwill be developed at the delivered by Wojtek Ronettes key and it will really\nanswer the questions what our neural networks what kinds of functions can\nthey represent how are they trained you know back propagation some review of\nthose ideas many of you will be familiar with them but I can tell you when Roy\nTech explains these things then they become clearer than they have ever been\nand of course also what are the limitations of neural networks\nlimitations of neural networks have led to the first neural network winter men\ndecades ago when neural networks with only a single layer were not able to\nsolve the simple XOR problem and when only only adding a second layer to the\nneural network then enables the system to solve this kind of problem so that's\nthese things are important to know the second lecture after that or a number\nlecture number three will be on convolutional neural networks for image\nrecognition given by sundar dilemma and the idea here is really to pick up on\nthe on the thought that we want to imbue the neural network with a form of prior\nknowledge because that will make learning more efficient than more data\nefficient and introducing convolutional neural networks is one way of doing that\nconvolutions encode a particular week prior about how images behave for\nexample they can encode translation invariant you know no matter where an\nobject is in the in the image it will still be the same thing and we'd like to\nencode these things in our neural networks and convolutional neural\nnetworks brainchild of Jung Lacan in his little net five work they really\nrevolutionized image recognition because they made these neural networks\ncompetitive for these tasks and nowadays every neural network application in the\narea of vision makes use of convolutional neural networks now in the\nnext lecture Viorica Petrossian will talk about vision beyond image net and\nobject recognition and talk about more advanced models and this might involve\nobject detection semantic segmentation you know what is what in a given scene\nestimation of optical flow she will also talk about analysis of videos videos can\nbe viewed just as stacked images in time and there are interesting tasks there\nfor example action recognition from a single frame you might not know what\nsomeone is doing but if you see a video of it then there's an action going on\nyou might want to recognize what that is you know for example\nsomeone smashing in the window or doing a sports exercise the next thing is self\nsupervised learning one problem that deep learning is plagued with is that it\nare it's supervised variant depends on labels you know when we learn object\nrecognition we need a photo and a label what's in it so to speak but in self\nsupervised learning we can learn a lot about the world without labels and this\nis particularly interesting if you have multiple modalities think of a video on\nYouTube there's a video stream but there's also an audio stream and the\naudio can tell us something about the video and the video can tell us\nsomething about the audio and so we can learn representations from that the next\nlecture is on optimization for machine learning given by James Martin's so you\ncan think of optimization as the engine that drives the learning process and of\ncourse it's a very old field how to how to optimize functions and he will focus\nin particular on gradient based optimization methods and their\napplication to training neural networks he'll cover gradient descent momentum\nmethods second-order methods and stochastic methods and just to give you\nan example this is a visualization of the error surface of the lost surface of\na neural network you see it's a complex beast it has this fine substructure\neverywhere with local optima there's a super interesting result in particular\nin this paper here mode connectivity that there are all of these little\nOptima this local Optima but there's a path between them where when you walk\nalong purl in the parameter space along this path all the solutions along that\npath are relatively good solutions that generalize well and those connect those\nmodes and you know there's a lot of complexity here in those lust surfaces\nand we need to understand optimization to to become good at training these\nneural networks I will then move on to sequences and\nrecurrent networks delivered by Marta gar nello\nand this is again the idea that we want to imbue the neural network with prior\nknowledge but this time its knowledge about time its knowledge about sequences\nmaybe the idea that in a sequence for what happens now more recent stuff have\nmatters more than stuff that happened longer time ago and why is this\nimportant well if you think about it a lot of data comes in the form of\nsequences speech text DNA sequences video audio they're all sequences we\nmight think of vectors that's like the first thing that we learned in machine\nlearning but almost all the interesting stuff comes in sequences and so she will\ndiscuss recurrent neural networks and also the famous LST M's long short-term\nmemory which is a way of dealing with the problem of vanishing gradients in\ntraining recurrent neural networks another interesting task here is\nsequence to sequence learning suppose you want to translate one language to\nanother that's one sequence to another and so\nthere's there's ways of training neural networks to do that as well we'll then\nmove on to deep learning for natural language processing in some sense a\nspecial case of the previous work and Felix will discuss why deep learning is\na good technique for language and he'll discuss simple recurrent your networks\napply to language but also more complex models up to transformers which is one\nof the most successful models he'll also talk about unsupervised learning because\nnot every piece of text is labeled so what can we learn if we just have a dump\nof Wikipedia or reddit you know a vast amount of text can we learn something\nabout language from that without having labels and finally he'll also talk about\nsubtle things like situated language understanding you know what does the\nsituation of a particular agent tell us the grounding the interaction of\nlanguage in the world here's just a tiny example of some recent very exciting\nwork in language modeling you know where they train this huge model I think on\nthe reddit corpus of a lot of data and it's a system that you can prompt with\nsome input text and it will then produce a continuation of that text and it\nproduces very fluent text I'll just read the completion but you know it's about\nthe prompt is about scientists discovering unicorns you know pretty\nabsurd but the model just keeps going the scientists named the population\nafter the distinctive horn of its unique urn these four horned silver white\nunicorns were previously unknown to science you know it's kind of\nsuperficially makes sense you listen to it and it sounds like English right\nwhat's going on so then Alex graves will talk it will turn your and his attention\nto attention and memory in deep learning which are emergent topics that are very\nimportant we know of course that for human cognition attention and memory are\nvery important but can you renege works and body these ideas it turns out that\nthey can and you can even foreign normal in your network see that it will pay\nparticular attention if you like to some parts of the input rather than others to\nsolve particular tasks we call that implicit attention but we can also make\nthat explicit we can build mechanisms that allow the neural network to zoom in\non particular parts of the input to put its attention there if you like\nand the highlight of that lecture might well be the idea of the neural Turing\nmachine or differentiable neural computer where there's a neural network\ncontroller that has access to an external memory that can write to it and\nread from it and it can solve problems in this way for example it can write the\ngraph of the of the London Underground system into this memory and then answer\nquestions about it about the connectivity of that graph so that\nshould be an interesting one now then move to unsupervised learning\nin particular generative latent variable models and variational inference\nby Andreini and I already mentioned unsupervised learning is very important\nbecause we don't have labels for a lot of tasks and in particular and\ninteresting model that he will consider is the auto encoder model at the\nvariational auto encoder model and the idea here is that from data you might\nwant to infer some latent variable responsible for generating that data for\nexample there's the image of a digit and you might want to determine what the\nlabel of that digit is but then given the label of that digit you might want\nto generate images of those digits and training these jointly is the model of\nthe variational auto encoder and it's a very powerful model for unsupervised\nlearning when you don't have labels but when you need your system to learn the\nunderlying representation then in lecture 10 will continue with work on\nunsupervised learning with the focus on representations and this will be\ndelivered by me al or Oscar and Irina Higgins\nand they'll ask the question what is a good representation which of course is\ntask dependent but can we characterized how we would like to represent the world\nand they'll argue that unsupervised learning has the potential to address a\nlot of the open problems that deep learning is struggling with for example\nthe large amount of data of labelled data that is needed and they will\ndiscuss different approaches to this here's a little example there's a data\nset of 3d or of 2d projections of 3d chairs and you know they just come in\nthe the system is just confronted with those how would it structure its\nperception of those it turns out that this bethe variational auto encoder is\nable to find different angle dimensions in this chaos where for example here's a\ndimension along which the rotation of the of the chair is discovered as one\nindependent dimension the width of the chair is discovered as another\nindependent dimension and the leg style is discovered as yet another independent\ndimension so this algorithm is thrown at this collection of data and it discovers\nwhat we would call natural factors in this data and that of course can be very\nuseful for downstream tasks in lecture 11 we'll talk about generative\nadversarial networks this is delivered by Mahalo rasca and\nJeff Donohue and this is a particularly fascinating recent development namely a\nmodel a generative model for data that is based on a little game that is being\nplayed it's really multi agency to agency there are two planners the\ngenerator that generates data and it discriminate that tries to discriminate\nif I want to generate a generated if that's the genuine image for the data or\nif it's just something that there was Maori generate and by thing is name in\ngradient space if you like this is gonna make it becomes better measuring what\nthe generals from real data but the generator becomes better and better at\nfooling the discriminator to generate data that really looks like real data\nand there are now many variations of this it's in Goodfellow started this\nwork in 2014 and it's it's one of the very interesting and hot topics in deep\nlearning now finally and I'm very happy that we have this in the program the\nlast lecture will be on the topic of responsible innovation and will be given\nby our son Gabriel and Charlie chin and the thought here is that AI provides\npowerful tools that are shaping our lives and our society but that of course\nwith the great power that we can wield here also comes great responsibility and\nwe would like to address that in this final lecture in two ways the first one\nis about building safe robust and verified AI systems that do what we\nlike them to do for example you hear you see an example of an adversarial example\nwhere a classifier classifies this image correctly as a deer but if you add just\na tiny bit of noise to it the right kind of noise adversarial noise it will then\nmiss classify almost the same image as a bird so these systems are not robust and\nwe need to understand the boundaries of what these systems can do and there's a\nwhole field developing around this idea that we need our AI systems to be a lot\nlike normal engineering reliable and robust and so on and we're beginning to\nunderstand how to do this better and better and the second aspect of this\nlecture is how to think about the ethics ethical consequences of building AI\nsystems and more as a joke and the starting point I've put here the Three\nLaws of Robotics by Asimov the science fiction writer because you know already\n80 years ago he was thinking about the consequences of deploying AI systems in\nthe world and had some idea of how they would need to be thought about the\nethics of this and what kinds of laws they should be following and of course\nnow we are confronted with systems that actually do influence the world you know\nyou have questions of employment where where there's automation and AI systems\ncan now do a lot of the jobs that that humans can do more and more in the\nfuture probably you have the questions of of bias and fairness that these\nsystems inherit certain properties from the datasets that they learned from that\nwe might not agree with and that we might want to change maybe an\nopportunity to change some things here and so yes and we'll we'll talk about\nthese aspects of our work in AI close the series of lectures okay that's all I\nhad to say thank you very much now we have some time for questions do you have\nany yes please yes so the question is what are the most important limitations\nof deep learning and if there are any there are plenty I would say it's an\nemergent technology if I had to name my number one it would be the lack of data\nefficiency so with all of these examples I've shown we had a lot of data\navailable in these reinforcement learning scenarios we generated a lot of\nthat data ourselves but in other settings we might need to draw on\nexisting data sets and they might just be limited in size for example in the\nprotein folding situation we have these 150,000 folded proteins with a lot of\nduplicates but that's not actually that much data for what deep learning\nrequires and my colleagues used a lot of data augmentation techniques to squeeze\nout the maximum of information out of this so that would be my number one data\nefficiency because as humans we are also we're very data efficient in our\nlearning and if we could approach that with deep learning I think that would be\ngreat another one of my concerns that is a little related to it is energy\nconsumption because these computational systems also consume a lot of energy and\nwe know that our brain works on roughly 20 watts like that's a dim light bulb so\nhow how can we bridge that gap that's another one of those and then on the\nside of a I I think there's way to go in questions like flexibility and common\nsense you know what we might characterize as fluid intelligence our\nit to quickly adapt to a new question to a\nnew situation to understand to act appropriately those are the big areas to\nwork on plenty of key ftcc's out there yeah so I think they go in the right\ndirections but they're really only the the beginning of the path the goal your\nyou asked you correctly characterizes that we want this generality these many\ndifferent things and how do how do these settings help us in the entire games\nthere clearly is a set of very different games that characterize you know that\nthat require a very different behavior so there is some diversity there is it\nenough diversity you know ideally we would have a less constrained setting\nmore real-world noisier with more different challenges that's true but I\nthink you have to see the trend you know for example in alphago we started with a\nsingle game and a lot of human knowledge that came into it and then we\ngeneralized it to three different games that the system can now play and of\ncourse it could be trained on other games as well so we expanded the class\nof things and I think the game we're playing here is we want to always expand\nthe class of things that we can do with our available methods and and eventually\nhave a very large pool of things that can be done yes that's a good question so does this\nautonomous driving take us somewhere near our real intelligence because it\nrequires the right reaction in so many different scenarios another way that we\nthink about this is is autonomous driving AI complete is it true that if\nyou can flawlessly drive and have a self-driving car does that mean that you\nhave a full intelligence and I think it's it's kind of in between but because\nthere still comes some constraints there but it is it's almost like that because\nthere is such a wide variety of different scenarios as you're describing\nand currently systems don't have the flexibility to react to these so I don't\nthink the the right approach here is to to just add data and try to sample that\nspace of situations we need to come up with new ideas how the system can reason\nabout about the world you know maybe with physical models maybe with multi\nagent models because a lot of the predictions we do in in traffic are\nbased on our understanding of what the other agents want you know does this\nagent want to dis car want to overtake me what does that bicycle ride I want to\ndo do they want to turn so all of these things so I think as we improve our\nunderstanding of how to model physical systems how to model multi-agent systems\nand how to acquire common sense then we'll be approaching autonomous driving\nit's a beautiful example because it's kind of it's so clear what we want to do\nhere in autonomous driving yet it is so hard other questions yes please that's a good question are we entering\ninto the new caste competition I don't know\nbut my colleagues are certainly very passionate about the problem and and\nwork has continued on protein folding for us this protein folding this this\nwas one step in that work and but we're in that for the long term so they are\ncertainly interested yes please right yeah so the question is if we do\nreinforcement learning with say two agents that train against one another\nwill they explore the whole space of possibilities or could they be get stuck\nin some particular part of strategy space so that's that's a very real\nconcern even in a single agent reinforcement learning setting the\nproblem of exploration versus exploitation is a huge problem so in\norder to reach long-term reward maximize long-term reward the agent needs to\nexplore the system and figure out what works and what doesn't but at the same\ntime it can then not exploit what it already knows about the system because\nif it only exploits it will not find out about other parts of that space so even\nin single agent RL exploration is a huge problem in a 2-player self play kind of\nscenario it can be a problem but we were able to overcome it with a bit of\nrandomization in in alpha zero that has somehow led led it to explore a lot of\nother options but in the capture-the-flag work we went one step\nfurther and we created a pool of diverse players that play differently and and\nthat was in an attempt to address exactly the problem we're pointing out\nbecause that a single player then to have a strategy\nthat can deal with a number of other opponent strategies and even teammate\nstrategies and they that's the same type of robustness that that we're looking\nfor in other intelligent systems you know be able to deal with a large\nvariety of situations p-nut environments or opponents or teammates that's exactly\nthe question yeah again that's a very good question how do we measure that one\nway of measuring it is by doing experiments with humans because humans\nare incredibly good at figuring out the patterns and finding counter strategies\nand that's why we did both in alpha go and alpha zero but also in the capture\nthe flag work we benchmarked with humans and they did find some interesting\nstrategies an alternative is to Train yet another agent that is just designed\nto exploit the given agent that that we're trying to test it's just designed\nto find the weaknesses in it and if reinforcement learning works then that\nagent will find weaknesses in it and in the alpha star work where my colleagues\napplied deep learning and RL to the game of StarCraft they had explicit exploiter\nagents in the pool they were training against whose sole role was to exploit\nthe given agents as being trained to avoid it from developing degenerate\nstrategies any other questions yes you immediately works for such as in\nmakeup to the black case where you never work for tagging the therapist if you\ncapture many points for that your agent might decide to ignore the\ngame and just go around attacking enemies yeah a nice place and if that's\ntrue yes that's that's a good question so it is a big problem how do we specify\na reward function such that the resulting system that optimizes them\nactually solves the problem that were interested in and the the answer is\nsometimes simple in the game of go that last you know you want a win rather than\nlose so there is clear in the game of capture the flag it's also clear you\nalso want to win that game but it's such a spaz reward signal that you want\nintermediate rewards and the way we did it in that work I didn't dwell on that\nis we actually learned a wait for the different game events that we can\nobserve you know capture a flag tag an opponent be tagged your flag being stole\nand so on there's a whole list of game events those are the events that real\nplayers of this game gets points for in the game and we learned a waiting\nfunction for these and the weighting function was learned to optimize for the\nfinal outcome go up and so there is a way of bootstrapping the learning\nprocess from the final outcome to denser more informative reward signals that the\nRL agents can then pick up on it's one way of solving it I think okay I'm\nafraid you need to wrap up our terms up I hope we can welcome you to the next\nlecture on the basics of neural networks by a Vortech have a great evening\nThanks you","wTSbvYBx4eg":"Translator: Maria Pericleous\nReviewer: Ellen Maloney Look around you. Almost everything you see \nis the product of intelligence. Of human intelligence. The magnificent theatre we are in,\nthe clothes we are wearing. The ideas we are sharing. Intelligence is the creative principle behind things like \nthe Theory of Relativity, the Mona Lisa, the idea of Democracy. So now imagine the possibilities if we could create \ntrue Artificial Intelligence, if we could make intelligence \nabundant through computers. I am here to tell you \nthat there is nothing more human than the pursuit \nof Artificial Intelligence. I am a research scientist at DeepMind, an Artificial Intelligence research lab. Our goal is to create \ntrue artificial intelligence. True A.I. Why? We believe that artificial intelligence is a tool that can help us solve some \nof the world's most complex problems. Problems like climate change, clean energy, access to water, and fighting disease. Artificial intelligence offers us \na chance to accelerate progress on questions like these by acting as a multiplier\nfor human ingenuity. But in order to create\nartificial intelligence, we first need to understand\nexactly what intelligence is. The hallmark of human intelligence\nis its generality. Nobody has expressed \nthis idea more vividly than Science Fiction author\nRobert A. Heinlein: \"A human being should be able \nto change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, \ntake orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.\" After sifting through over 70\ndefinitions of intelligence, my colleague Shane Legg\narrived at a very similar conclusion. Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals\nin a wide range of environments. Or, in his favourite language\n[mathematical formula on the screen] So let's unpack this definition. Who or what can be intelligent? The answer is what we call an Agent: Someone or something that can take action. And this could be a human being,\nit could be a machine, it could be a piece of software. In order to be intelligent, an Agent\nneeds to be able to achieve goals. But not just a few, or very specific ones,\ngoals in a wide range of environments. Clearly, the definition \ncalls for a generalist. Specialists need not apply. So how would you go about \nbuilding an intelligent machine? Here's an idea: for every task or problem think of how a human would solve it. Then take the human solution and encode it as a set of rules\nfor the computer. We sometimes call this approach GOFAI Good Old-Fashioned\nArtificial Intelligence. This plausible approach has been tried, but unfortunately it has mostly failed. The reason? People are incredibly good\nat solving problems, but incredibly bad at explaining\nexactly how they do it. So what else can we do? Let's turn to the one living proof that human-level intelligence\nis actually possible. Our own human minds. I don't know what your experience is, but in my experience, when we learn\nwe learn from experience. When we apply that very idea\nto computer software, we call it machine learning. You can think of machine learning\nas a new way of programming a computer. We don't feed it rules or instructions, instead we let it learn \nfrom examples and experience. Hence for the remainder of the talk, the protagonist will be\nan artificial learning agent that interacts with the world\nin three different ways. It observes the state of the world, it takes action in the world, and it receives rewards\nfor achieving goals. The learning agent's brain\nis an artificial neural network. That's a a computer architecture\nthat's inspired by the human brain. During training it learns\nby adapting the connections between its artificial brain cells. The goal? To take actions that lead\nto the greatest reward in the future. So as an example for training, let's take our best friend\nand learning agent, the dog. And cat lovers will understand\nwhy we are not using a cat here. (Laughter) What would you do\nif you wanted to train your dog to sit on command? First you lure it into a sitting position. Then you utter the command, \"sit\", and then you reward it with a treat. As you do this again and again, the dog's brain learns by adapting\nthe connections between its neurons to get the treat. So artificial learning agents are trained\nin much the same way as this, and that's what we call machine learning. Science fiction, you might be saying, not at all. The mobile phone responding\nto your voice commands? Your photos automatically\ntagged by content? Your messages translated \ninto a different language online? All of these systems have been\ntrained by machine learning. By feeding them examples, not rules. But for true artificial intelligence where will all the experience and the rich interactions\nto learn come from? Surprisingly, we can find inspiration in Stefan Zweig's famous book\n\"The Royal Game\". The book tells the story of Dr B, an innocent man who has been arrested\nand is being held in solitary confinement. Not unlike our learning agent, Dr B is alone in a small world,\nand starved of stimulation. \"They did nothing to us, other than subjecting us \nto complete nothingness\". For as is well known nothing on earth puts more pressure\non the human mind than nothing. One day, while waiting\nfor an interrogation, Dr B manages to steal a book\nfrom one of his captors. A book about the game of chess. Eager to engage his mind, Dr B devours the book\nand learns to play chess. He replays the master games in the book again and again. But after a while, those games\nhave lost their novelty. Desperate for further diversion, Dr B attempts to play chess\nagainst himself. But he soon realizes that in order to play chess\nagainst himself, he needs to split his mind\ninto two halves: an \"I\" black and an \"I\" white. Now, only now, with two agents in play, can there be true \ninteraction and learning. Years later on a cruise ship, Dr B meets the world chess champion\nat the time, Mirko Czentovic. An expert at chess, and only at chess. In a stunning demonstration of his skills, Dr B manages to do the impossible: he wins at chess against\nthe World Chess Champion. Fast forward 80 years,\nand Stefan Zweig's story becomes reality in a way that not even the author \ncould have imagined. The modern Czentovic, Stockfish, computer chess champion 2016. A good, old-fashioned\nArtificial Intelligence for playing chess, and only chess. The modern Dr B, AlphaZero, an artificial learning agent, that learns to play chess\nsolely by playing against itself. And not just chess. Also the difficult games of Shogi and Go. In a match of 1,000 games, AlphaZero wins 25 times\nas many games as Stockfish. And according to former world\nchess champion Garry Kasparov, it did so in great style indeed. So how does AlphaZero work? AlphaZero is a learning agent, \nthat much like Dr B, begins with zero knowledge\nabout the game of chess, except for the rules. When it starts playing against itself, it plays more or less randomly. But at some point,\nit stumbles upon a victory, and that's when the magic\nstarts happening. AlphaZero begins to learn. It learns by adapting the connections \nbetween its artificial neurons to make more successful moves\nmore likely to be played. As it becomes a better player, it produces even better games\nfrom which to learn. In only eight hours, AlphaZero learns more \nabout the game of chess than had been learnt\nin the past 1,500 years. But can our learning agents\ngo beyond pure competition, and become team players? After all, we humans \nthrive on cooperation. In order to find out, we trained our learning agents\non another game. Capture the flag. In Capture the Flag, players team up to capture the opponent team's flag, \nwhile protecting their own. In the video game players control \nthe movements of their avatar, and they can tag opponents. Here's a video showing\nhow to capture a flag. On the left you will see \nthe agent perspective, and on the right you see a top-down view. So, run to the opponent base and pick up the flag. Then bring it back to your own base, but in order to score, \nyou need to make sure that your own flag\nis at your own base at the time. Similar to AlphaZero,\nwe trained the learning agents by letting them play against themselves\nfor millions of games. But the environment here \nis much richer than chess, it's a 3D environment. The agents need to learn\nto cooperate as well as to compete. And because our goal is generality, \nwe train them on a diverse set of maps, with different teammates, \nand against different opponents. We were excited to discover \nthat the learning agents learnt some rather advanced behaviours. For example, they learnt \nto defend their home base. They learnt to set up camp\nin the opponent base, to wait till the flag there re-appears,\nso that they can capture it. And they learnt to follow their teammates,\nbecause then they can work together. Eventually, the learning agents\nbecame stronger at the game than strong human players. Against a fixed pool of opponents,\nthe learning agents won 74% of their games as compared to strong human players, \nwho only won 52% of their games. But what surprised us the most,\nwas that the human players preferred to play with the artificial \nlearning agents on their team. They said they were simply \nmore skilled and reliable. (Laughter) But enough about \nartificial learning agents. What have we as human \nlearning agents learnt so far? Maybe that the pursuit \nof artificial intelligence is a more human endeavour than we thought. After all, we take inspiration \nfrom human intelligence, when we say that the hallmark\nof intelligence is its generality. We take inspiration from human learning, when we say that intelligent agents \nneed experience and not instructions. And we take inspiration\nfrom human interaction, when we emphasize that we need \nto train our learning agents together, to overcome the nothingness\nthat haunted Dr B in the story. So to conclude, using our own human intelligence maybe one day we can create \ntrue Artificial Intelligence, a tool that not only plays games but that can help us tackle\nsome of the great problems of our times with greater intelligence. (Applause)","VdDmhOCw6J0":"[MUSIC PLAYING] DANIEL VISENTIN:\nSo as Zak said, I'm from DeepMind's\napplied group, where I work on a team that applies\nDeepMind's research to machine learning and\nreinforcement learning-- DeepMind's research in machine\nlearning and reinforcement learning to Google's products. Today I'm going to\nbriefly talk to you about why we chose to use\nTensorFlow, how we use it, and how it's helped us. So the choice of a\nnumerical computing platform such as TensorFlow\nis incredibly important to us. It's how we express our ideas,\nand it's the piece of software our engineers and\nscientists spend most of their time interacting with. The quality of that platform has\na direct and significant effect on the quality of our work\nand the speed with which we can deliver results. And there are several aspects\nto what we look for in that. So from flexibility,\nour researches continue to concoct all these\nweird and wonderful networks, which we're hoping\nto put into use. Usability-- using this platform\nhas to be easy and natural. Simple things like\ngetting some embeddings and passing through a\nfeed-forward network have to be trivial. Composing things should be easy. We should be able to take\nall these components which people are developing\nand knock them together to create new things. We need to be able to reach\ninto the guts of that network to see what it's doing, and\nwe need tools for visualizing and debugging what's going on. The platform also\nhas to be scalable. We see this move towards\nincreasingly more data, increasingly larger\nnetworks trained on more powerful accelerators\nacross multiple servers. And the more that trend\ncontinues, the better. We need to be performant. So training machine\nlearning models is the new compile link cycle. It often takes days\nor even weeks for us to get results, which reduces\nthe speed with which we can iterate and try new things. So the faster it goes,\nthe faster we can develop. It's also important\nat serve time, where latency is a critical\nfactor in what we can do. We often have quite\ntight latency boundaries. The more performant\nthe model is, the more expressive and more\ncomputationally powerful models we can use, which will\ngive us bigger accuracy gains. Also with training,\nperformance matters, because when we're training\non real data at serve time, the speed with\nwhich we can train affects the freshness\nof the model, which often has downstream effects\non our accuracy at serve time. And finally,\nproduction readiness-- we often spend all this time\ndoing research, and evaluation, and experimentation\nof our models. And when we finally come\nup with a good thing, we want to get it into\nproduction as soon as possible to do\nlive experiments and ultimately scale it up to\nall the traffic that we have. So previously at\nDeepMind, our projects were all implemented in\neither Torch or Disbelief. As TensorFlow began\nto mature and head towards its first\nopen source release, we started looking at it\nas an interesting thing. In the applied group, we\nbegan experimenting with it by trying a few new projects. Meanwhile, the\nresearch team, who have this very\nstable, much used code base they needed to\nthink about, began by carefully evaluating the\nsuitability by reimplementing several existing projects. Based on the results\nof that, we decided that TensorFlow was\nthe way forward, and so we started to migrate. So over the past\nyear or so, we've been working on that process. And as of today, most of our\ncode that we currently use is in TensorFlow. And all the stuff-- the significant amount of stuff\nwe're building from now on will be in TensorFlow. What's quite cool about this is\nwe made this decision a year, a year and a half ago, and\nsince then, the TensorFlow and the ecosystem\naround it has improved beyond our expectations. So we're even more\nhappy with this decision now than we were then. So I'm going to spend the\nrest of my time talking a bit more specifically\nabout how we use TensorFlow and how it helps us. And since I'm from the applied\ngroup, I'll start there. So one of the coolest\nthings we've done recently is on optimizing the energy\nusage in Google's data centers. This began when the technical\ninfrastructure team came to us after seeing the AlphaGo\nmatches and wondered how we could use RL to\ncontrol the data centers more efficiently. So we work with them,\nand subsequently worked with teams in Google Brain\nto build models to control the cooling infrastructure. Briefly, this is what a cold\naisle in one of Google's data centers looks like. This is the servers. Some of them, maybe,\nare running TensorFlow, and they're getting\nhot doing so. So we have these fans\nat the back, which pull that cold air\nover the servers into this hot aisle, where it\ntravels down and is transferred into a water cooling system. So here are some\npipes and some pumps. And the pipes take the hot\nwater from the hot aisle to the chillers on the roof,\nand the cold water from those chillers back to the cold aisle. And here's what those\ncooling towers look like. They're just big fans\nwhich take the water and cool it down into the air. So we spent a while\nworking on this offline. We had to take into\naccount safety. The model couldn't go\nand try random things, otherwise we'd break\nbillion-dollar data centers, which is never great. And we had to work out how\nto do a bit of exploration as well, because if we\njust learned on the data which we had available,\nthe model would probably never learn to do\nanything more optimal than what the human\noperators had done. So we iterated a bit,\nand when it eventually came time to experiment,\nwe turned it on, and we saw this nice drop. >From my experience, it's\nkind of rare to see something so defined and\nsustained like this, so we're quite happy with it. So we had this initial\nresult, and it came time to implement it. Because the data\ncenters didn't really have the infrastructure\nset up to run, and train, and evaluate, and verify\nmachine learning models, we had to write a lot\nof this ourselves. So we did that. We took our original\nTorch models and moved them to TensorFlow. We built up all this\ntraining, and validation, and serving stuff. But over the past\nyear, what we've witnessed the development\nin these high-level APIs around TensorFlow and components\nlike TensorFlow Serving, which basically negate a lot of\nthe work that we had to do, which from our perspective\nis great because we'd rather focus on the modeling\naspects than all this kind of infrastructure stuff. Cool. So another example\nwhere TensorFlow helped us is we\npreviously had this system called Gorila, which stands for\ngeneral reinforcement learning architecture, with some extra\nletters thrown in there. And we wrote this,\ninitially, to speed up training of DQN style agents. So what this was was a framework\nbuilt on top of disbelief. We had the parameters\nof an agent stored across multiple\nparameter servers, and multiple instances\nof that agent pulling the parameters\nfrom that parameter server and interacting with\nenvironments to get experience. That experience was then stored\nin a distributed memory where multiple learners sampled\nfrom it to make updates to the model parameters. And the whole thing kind\nof cycled around like that. By doing it this way, we\ncould get more experience faster because we\nhad multiple agents, and we could learn\nfaster because we had multiple learners. But often, more than the\nspeed of convergence, we often saw that sometimes\nthese models actually did better than models\ntrained on single servers. And we think that\nhad something to do with the breaking\nof correlations between the examples we\ntrained on from time to time. This also was one\nof the inspirations for the A3C training algorithm,\nwhich our researchers later developed. So with the introduction\nof TensorFlow, we were able to\nbasically deprecate this because much of\nthe functionality is handled by\nTensorFlow or can be written from within\nTensorFlow, which is great because it's less time\nwe need to spend on code and maintaining it,\nand more time we can spend on our\nactual projects. More generally, since we've\nstarted using TensorFlow, we've seen a reduction\nacross the board in the amount of ancillary\nwork we have to perform. And things are only getting\nbetter as TensorFlow and the ecosystem around\nit continues to develop. So one of these is\nthe high-level APIs which are developing, which take\ncare of a lot of the work we previously had to do\nto start a new project, to build a prototype, to\ntrain it and evaluate it, meaning we can spend\nmore time on modeling. It's easy to experiment\nwith models in TensorFlow. It's easy to put together\na baseline in a couple lines of code. It's easy to change\nthings about it. So for example, if we\nhave a bunch of embeddings from various time\nseries, do we want to concatenate the last\n10 of them together? Do we want to\nconvolve over them? Do we want to pass them through\nan LSTM to get the state? It's all just a couple\nof lines of changes, which is quite nice. The distributed\ntraining helps us. We can try more things\nquicker and sooner. And finally, once we've\ngone through all this work and we're excited and wanting\nto put them all into production, TF Serving kind of gets rid\nof a lot of the pain that was previously there. So all this amounts to a quicker\ndevelopment cycle, meaning we can support more projects. We can experiment more,\nand we can deliver quicker, which is great. And what's more, we've yet to\ncome across an instance in any of these collaborations\nwith Google where TensorFlow\nhas not been suited to the problem we're working\non, hasn't been flexible enough, which is great. So I'm excited about\nthe possibilities here, and I hope we can tell you more\nabout some of these projects soon. So the applied team is\nonly one part of DeepMind, and our friends in\nresearch are also busy doing lots of\ncool stuff and have begun to take advantage\nof TensorFlow to do so. So one of the obvious\nthings and one of the most exciting\nmoments for us last year was when AlphaGo succeeded\nin a series of matches against Lee Sedol, one of\nthe greatest Go players of the last decade. What made this so\nexciting was it was a combination of a\ngreat technical achievement in making a strong Go\nplayer, but it also represented something of a new\nbeginning in the game of Go. Interest boomed. Go boards sold out across the\nworld, which was interesting. And players responded, not\nwith a sense of defeat, but they were excited about\nit as a new beginning, because they could work\nwith these machines to explore more deeply the\nmysteries of this ancient game. More to the point,\nAlphaGo was one of the first significant\nuses of TensorFlow at DeepMind, where it was\nused to great advantage to train these networks,\npowering AlphaGo. So I won't spend too much\ntime talking about Go itself. Just suffice it it say, it's\na perfect information game with a very high\nbranching factor and a lot of moves in a particular game. So your standard minimax\nsearch obviously won't work. The main component of\nAlphaGo was composed of these two networks-- a policy network\nand a value network. The policy network was trained\nto, given a game state, work out which move the\nopponent was going to make. And the value network was\ntrained to, given a game state, predict how likely we\nwere to win that game. So naively, while you could\njust use the value network to evaluate your\nnext set of moves, in practice that wasn't quite\ngood enough for what we needed. So we resorted to a\nbit of a compromise, using these nets with a\nMonte Carlo tree search to get better results. And the way this\nbasically works is, if you do a full Monte\nCarlo search, that's way too many possibilities. So we use this policy network\nto guide the paths in the search tree to the most likely paths. And then at some point further\non in one of those paths, we'd use the value\nnetwork to evaluate how good that path was,\nmeaning we didn't have to go all the way to the end. Why the value network\nperformed better in that case is because as we unrolled\nthese paths, more of the game had unfolded. And things were more\ncertain, so the value network had a better prediction. But the real thing\nwhere TensorFlow came in was the training of this thing,\nwhich was quite significant. It took quite a\nsignificant amount of work. So we started by taking\ngames from expert players and training this\npolicy network. And then we began\nthis iterative process where we use\nreinforcement learning to train a value network\nfrom that policy network, and then update the\npolicy network to produce better moves. Previously, doing this\non Torch, it was slow. And when we moved\nto TensorFlow, we were able to bring the whole\npower of distributed training to bear on this, which made\nthe whole thing faster. It meant our researchers\ncould iterate quicker and try new things. Another cool thing\nfrom this year was WaveNet, which\nwe use to generate realistic audio signals. So this is hard in general,\nbecause sound waves have this complex\noscillating structure with a very high sampling rate,\non the order of 16 kilohertz. Generating an audio\nsignal requires a model which is able to\nreproduce this sort of signal at both these very\nfine-grained oscillations, on the order of milliseconds,\nand the whole signal over seconds, which is\ndifficult because of the amount of information. So there were two main\napproaches to this, previously-- concatenative models\nand parametric models. So a concatenative model\nworked by having a speaker say a whole bunch of\nsound, and chopping it up into little bits, and\nthen reassembling those to say whatever you wanted. What you often see\nfrom these is the sound seems kind of choppy\nbecause these transitions between these sound segments\ndon't quite match up. It's also difficult\nto modify the voice, either adding a new speaker\nor altering the emphasis or emotion. Similarly there, the other\nwas parametric models, of which WaveNet is one, where\nall the information required to generate speech is stored\nin the parameters of the model. And you supply information\nabout what you want to say and the characteristics of\nthat as inputs to the model. However, prior to\nWaveNet, we noticed that parametric text\nto speech tended to sound a bit less natural\nthan concatenative models. So WaveNet changes the\nparadigm that was previously in parametric models\nby directly modeling the waveform of the audio\nsignal, one sample at a time. So as well as yielding more\nnatural sounding speech by directly modeling\nthe [INAUDIBLE], it means that WaveNet can\nproduce any kind of audio, not just speech. So the architecture\nfor this evolved out of work on pixel\nRNNs and pixel CNNs, which were used for\ngenerating images. And the key piece\nof architecture here was the use of\na dilated convolution with an exponentially increasing\nstride as the layers increased. What this allowed\nthe model to do was to have a receptive\nfield size that was exponential in the\nnumber of the layers in the model, which\nallowed it to incorporate all this into information\nabout the signal. The other cool thing\nabout this structure is that in the first\nhalf of the input, compared to the\nsecond half, there are twice the number\nof connections, meaning it uses that\ninformation to a greater degree. So here are some\nsamples generated from the various systems. So on the left, we have audio\nfrom a concatenative model, [INAUDIBLE] play-- the left one, yeah. CONCATENATIVE MODEL:\n\"The Blue Lagoon\" is a 1980 American\nromance and adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser. DANIEL VISENTIN: So\nif you listen closely, you can perceive some\nof the discontinuities in the generated audio, due\nto the slight mismatches in the transitions between\nthe different recorded chunks. So in the middle, we\nhave a parametric model. PARAMETRIC MODEL:\n\"The Blue Lagoon\" is a 1980 American\nromance and adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser. DANIEL VISENTIN:\nWhich is less choppy, but it doesn't have\nthat natural quality we associate with normal speech-- and so, and finally,\nwe have WaveNet. WAVENET: \"The Blue Lagoon\"\nis a 1980 American romance and adventure film\ndirected by Randal Kleiser. DANIEL VISENTIN: Which,\ncompared to the other two, is very smooth and natural-- the only slight thing\nthat WaveNet does is it has a bit of noise,\ndue to the sampling procedure and the neural network. So maybe if we play\nthem all again, just so people can\nsee, hear, from-- SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE] DANIEL VISENTIN: Yeah,\njust from left to right. SPEAKER: You want\nto play them again? DANIEL VISENTIN: Yeah, thanks. CONCATENATIVE MODEL:\n\"The Blue Lagoon\" is a 1980 American\nromance and adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser. PARAMETRIC MODEL:\n\"The Blue Lagoon\" is a 1980 American\nromance and adventure film directed by Randal Kleiser. WAVENET: \"The Blue Lagoon\"\nis a 1980 American-- DANIEL VISENTIN: Thanks. [LAUGHTER] So we compared WaveNet\nagainst other models through the use\nof opinion scores. And what we found by human\nraters, and what we found was that it narrowed the gap\nto human speech by about 50%, which is great. And because WaveNet models,\nthey model the raw audio signal, we can also get it to produce\nsound other than speech. So here's an example\nwhere we trained it on a corpus of classical music. [MUSIC PLAYING] Thanks-- as you can hear,\nit's able to generate-- oh, go back one, yeah, thanks. As you can hear,\nit's able to generate realistic sounding piano notes\non a moment-to-moment basis. And finally, with what must be\none of my favorite paper titles of the year, \"Learning to\nLearn by Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent,\" in\nwhich some of our researchers trained a neural network\nto train a neural network, which I think is a great example\nof the kind of flexibility that TensorFlow offers. And I think, going\nforward, we're going to see more of this kind\nof crazy, out-there stuff, like with models learning\narchitectures of models, models adding bits and pieces\nto themselves, and so on. And so it's exciting to see\nthat TensorFlow can handle that. And I know, at least\nfrom us at DeepMind, that TensorFlow is going to\nbe our choice of how we model these things going forward. So if you're interested\nin more details, you can look at our\nwebsite, deepmind.com. There's a blog post linked\nhere, which rounds up some of the things from last year. And we also have links\nto the over 100 papers that we've published so far. Thanks for listening.

It's great to be here. I'm going to talk\nto you a little bit today about a company called\nDeepMind Technologies that I started six years ago\nwith some friends of mine. Our mission is to solve\ngeneral intelligence. And so this means\nbuilding general purpose learning algorithms. So today I want to give you a\nlittle bit of a taste for what that actually means in\npractice and show you some of the real\nworld applications that we've been working on. But first, let me tell you about\nour company and our culture. We are at heart a\nresearch organization. We're based in King's\nCross, up in North London. We have about 200 or so of the\nbest AI and machine learning researchers in the world. We publish all of our\npapers, publish more than 100 peer-reviewed academic papers. And a couple of years ago,\nwe were acquired by Google. And we became Google DeepMind. And these days, we've\nbeen running independently from the mothership, from\nthe Alphabet mothership. And this is really\nimportant to us. It was important\nwhen we were acquired that we were able to carry on\nthe independence and the kind of strong culture that we had\ndeveloped as a British company over here in London, as we are. And we've managed to\npreserve that I think over the last couple years. We also have at our heart a\nvery strong social mission. And I think what\nwe've managed to do is combine the very\nbest from academia, with its focus on long-term hard\nresearch questions that really get you thinking about\nwhat life should or could be like in 10 years time, and\nbring that to bear in a very fast-paced culture that\nhas the kind of scale and agility and, of\ncourse, resources of a large corporation,\ntaking the best of both worlds and trying to combine\nthem together. And all the while, we're very\nmuch underpinned by, I think, the kind of social impact\nvalues of the public sector. It's really important\nto us that we're able to work on\napplications that make the world a better place. And at our heart,\nthat is what's really motivating us to try to\nsolve general intelligence. So as I said, our\nmission is to distill the essence of what\nhas created all of this incredible civilisation\nand everything of value around us into an\nalgorithmic construct. Our brains are\nincredibly powerful. They create our\nsocial relations, our economic systems,\nour culture, our art. And somehow if we're able to\nrepresent the characteristics that make us unique\nas human beings and make us distinct\nas a species, represent those things in\nan algorithmic construct, we might be able to do a\nbetter job of planning, of classification, of search,\nand really important things that make us unique. But we want to\nsolve intelligence so that we can make the\nworld a better place. And I think this is a really\nfundamental part of our mission that we've tried to integrate\ninto the heart of everything that we work on. So why do we think it's possible\nnow to build general purpose learning systems? Well, I guess there's\ntwo broad factors. The first is to say that\nwe've made incredible progress on the hardware. And I think what\nis less well known is that we're making\nincredible progress on algorithmic efficiency. So let's start with what\nyou'll all be familiar with, massively faster computers. Back in 1990, a laptop just like\nthis one costing about $5,000 if trained on ImageNet,\none of the classic tasks in training deep\nneural networks. When compared today, to be\ntrained on a laptop built in 2015 costing roughly\naround the same kind of money actually would have\ntaken 270,000 years to train on exactly\nthe same task that today takes around\nthree weeks, which is kind of incredible. So precisely the same\nalgorithm trained on different hardware over\nroughly a 20-year or so period. And what this actually\nmeans is the search space for new algorithms is\ngetting much, much smaller. So it means that we can\nalmost brute force the search for the optimal\ncombination of algorithm because hardware\nis so, so cheap. We can train much bigger\nalgorithms much, much faster. And so we can afford to\nsearch through the space of all possible\ncombinations of algorithms. Now, this is really interesting,\nbecause combined with this, we've also seen a massive\nimprovement in the efficiency of the algorithm itself. So let's take the\nclassic chess computer system developed by IBM back\nin the day called Deep Blue. And it beat Garry\nKasparov in 1997 searching 200 million\nmoves per second. And this was a very\ntraditional system. It's hard to almost\ncall it an AI system, given what we're doing\nwith AI these days. It was a hand-crafted\nset of rules written by a bunch of\nexpert Grandmasters who essentially said, if you\nfind yourself in this position, then it's most likely\nthat you should take this set of actions. It's a very structured,\nrelational database. But it is very powerful, and\nit obviously used brute force to search through 200\nmillion moves a second and beat the world\nchampion at chess. But back in 2009,\njust a decade or more later, Pocket Fritz,\na computer program running on an iPhone, an\nearly version of the iPhone, actually won a professional\ntournament nine wins to one against a Master, searching,\nmost importantly, only 20,000 positions per second. So this is a 10,000\ntime speed up over a 12-year period in the\nefficiency of the algorithm. So when you combine\nthis with the efficiency that we've seen in\nhardware, these two things make it possible to train\nreally very different algorithmic systems today. And what we're\nultimately interested in is how we build general\npurpose learning systems. So I'm going to tell\nyou a little bit about the kind of\nphilosophy or the framework that we use to\ntrain these systems. Traditional AI approaches\nhave focused, as I said, on very structured,\nrule-based learning, that take the human intelligence as\nexpressed in symbols or words and try to represent that\nin kind of Boolean logic. So if this, then that. And what we've been\nvery committed to do is to try to train\nan algorithm to learn its own representation\nof the world through interaction\nwith some environment. So all of our systems begin\nwith the training of a machine learning system, or an agent. That agent has some goal, which\nis defined by the human being, and it's able to interact\nwith some environment. And you can think\nof this environment in very general terms. It could be a robotic system\ninteracting with a kitchen or a car manufacturing plant. It could be YouTube,\nwhere the environment is to try to recommend\nvideos that people watch, or it could be an energy grid. And that agent is able\nto take a set of actions in the environment,\ninteract with it in some way by recommending a\nvideo on YouTube or controlling a robotic arm. And then the environment passes\nback a set of state updates. So after the interaction\nwith the environment, the environment has\nsomehow changed. And so all the sensors\nthat collect information about that environment send\nthe updated observations back to the agent. And it's through this\nprocess of interaction through reinforcement\nlearning, we're able to train agents to learn\ntheir own representation of what it takes to\noptimize some goal. And right in the\nbeginning, we were very successful in\ntraining our algorithms on the old-school Atari testbed. So many of you will\nbe familiar with this. It's like 100 or so Atari\ngames from the '70s and '80s. And the environment is\nsimply a set of raw pixels. So at every frame, we're\npassing back a set of RGB, or red, green, blue\nvalues, to the algorithm based on where that sits in\na frame, on an x and y-axis. And so really there's no\npre-programmed knowledge. Everything is\nlearned from scratch. So we're not hand coding any\ninsight into the algorithm. We're not saying, this\nis what a color is or this is what motion\nand dynamics are, or this is a paddle,\nthis is an enemy. We're really saying\ngiven this set of pixels, over time can you optimize\nyour goal function, which is to get more reward,\nby tweaking the action buttons? And so that is really\nall we give to the agent. We just wire them up\nto the action buttons and give them the motivation of\ntrying to optimize for score. So really the best intuition is\nto think about a robot standing in an arcade being fed the\npixels from the video screen and fiddling around with the\njoystick and the fire button in order to find out\nwhat the association is between the set of actions it's\nable to take, the set of pixels that it saw in the\nlast few frames, and the reward that it gets. It's kind of just simple\nassociative learning at one level. So let me give you a sense\nfor what this looks like. This is the old\ngame of Breakout. And here we are after\n100 games, the agent's just arrived in the environment. So it really has\nno idea what to do. It's sort of moving\naround left and right, trying to explore the\nspace and randomly discover what kind of actions\nseem to be rewarding. After 300 games,\nit seems to have learned pretty well that\nthere's a strong association between moving the bat\ninto the right place to hit the ball back\nat the right time. And this is pretty\nmuch human performance. This is better than I can play. But interestingly, we left\nit training for 500 games overnight, and it developed\nthis really cool strategy where it tunnels the\nball up the sides to get maximum points\nwith minimum effort. And this was super\nsurprising to us as engineers because it was\nreally cool in some sense because many humans don't\nrealize that strategy when playing the game,\nand it was something that emerged through\nthe agent interacting with the game on its own. So it's really surprising\nto see the first signs, the complex behaviors,\nrelatively complex behaviors, can emerge without us\nhand-crafting those features in. So this was really\nexciting to us two and a half, three years ago. Another example is the\ngame of Space Invaders. And so this is a video\nof before training. You can see that it's getting\nkilled all of the time. It's sort of randomly\nfiring around. It doesn't realize that\nthose things are denying it, when it gets hit by\none of those missiles, it's denying it\nfrom getting score. It doesn't realize that when it\nhits one of the Space Invaders above, it's actually\ngetting reward. And after training, it's\nlearned a whole bunch of really interesting dynamics. So first of all,\nyou can see it often hiding behind the orange\nobstacle, because it knows that if it gets hit by\none of those missiles it's in big trouble. Secondly, you can see\nthat it's actually often aiming at the top. So it's trying to\nget those ones first because it gets more reward. Here, we see the\npink mothership. And it does an incredible\npredictive shot to try and get that because it\ngets more reward for hitting that at the right time. And the other thing is you can\nsee that it very rarely wastes bullets. It's actually very\nprecise and accurate and it can do really\ncool predictive shots, just right at the end, as you\nsee, to get the last enemy. So it plays the game and\nindeed it plays 57 of the games to human or superhuman\nperformance. The same algorithm performing\nin a very general way across all of these\ndifferent environments. And the environments\nperceptually have very different physics,\nvery different objectives, very, in some cases, long-term\ntemporal dependencies. So it's not really\njust reacting; it's actually having to\nmake a series of decisions and get them right in\nsequence over time. We were very lucky enough to be\nawarded a Nature paper for this and we managed to get\nthe front cover back in 2015, which, as many of you\nwill know through academics, is the prized possession\nfor an academic research lab like ours. We extended this work\nearlier in the year to the old classic\nancient game of Go. So let me tell you a\nlittle bit about the game. Essentially, the objective\nis to place stones on a 19 by 19 board. And if you're white, I'm black. And the objective is to\ntry and place stones such that you surround your\nopponent's territory. So there's really no\nfurther rules than that. It's very unstructured. It's very abstract. And there are no\nsort of tricks that help you to exploit\nstructure in the space. So in chess, for\nexample, all the pieces are worth different\namounts, and so you can focus all your energy\non protecting your queen, for example, because\nit's really valuable. Or you don't have to\nbother about thinking, can a pawn move\nfive squares ahead, because you know\nthat's an illegal move. Whereas, in the game of Go,\nthere's very, very little structure and so\nthe search space is really absolutely enormous. It's a 3,000-year-old game. And believe it or not,\nit's incredibly popular all over the world. There are 40 million\nplayers worldwide. And the really\nextraordinary thing that make it so\ndifficult to play is that there are 10 to the\npower of 170 possible state spaces on a 19 by 19 board. So just to give a sense\nof what this means, it's a 10 with 170\nzeros on to describe the number of possible\nboard configurations that are possible in the game. And it's been estimated that\nthere are something like 10 to the 70, so 10 with 70 zeros\nafter it, atoms in the known universe. In every liquid, solid, and\ngas in the known universe, there are many, many,\nmany orders of magnitude fewer possible atoms\nin the known universe than there are possible board\npositions in the game of Go. So just impossibly\ndifficult large number to intuit and get\nyour head around. This is roughly what\nthe branching factor looks like in chess, a\nmuch, much smaller and more structured space. And so here there\nare something like 10 to the power of 40\npossible board positions. And so for every\npossible move, there arise another set of\nmoves that are possible, and then another\nset, and another set. And this branches out for\nabout 100 or so, and that roughly makes up 10\nto the power of 40 or so possible board positions. But this is what it\nlooks like for there to be 10 to the power of 170\npossible board positions. At every moment there's\nan enormous number of positions that are\npossible at the next move. And so trying to model structure\nin a space that is so large is really very, very difficult.\nWriting an evaluation function to know if you're in a strong\nposition or a weak position is incredibly hard. And so all of the top players\nessentially rely on intuition. And that branching\nfactor that you see there goes on for\n200 possible branches until you reach the\nend of the game. So we trained two\ndifferent neural networks that learn a representation of\nwhat is effective in the space. The first is to basically say,\ngiven a set of possible moves that might be valuable at\nthis particular position, how do I identify which\none I should take. So here what we see is\nthat, the green layer, there's 10 different positions\nthat have been identified. And that network has been\ntrained on past games, 100,000 or so past games. So we're learning from the\nvery best of human knowledge to bootstrap our\nalgorithm to start from at least the best that\nhuman knowledge has to provide. And once a particular\nposition has been identified, the algorithm then trains\na different network to search the value of\nthat particular position. And so we're trying\nto figure out the probability of\nwinning if we roll forward from this kind of position. And so both of these networks\nwork in tandem with one another to make a guess at\nwhich movie should be taken. Earlier this year, we played\nthe world champion, Lee Sedol, over in Seoul in Korea for\na $1 million live match. Our system, AlphaGo,\nplayed Lee Sedol. And he is still the legend\nof the game, 18 world titles, and is considered the greatest\nplayer in over the last decade. We actually won the game,\nwhich was super exciting. We won four to one. And widely recognized to be a\ndecade earlier than expected. And it created an\nincredible buzz. So there were 280\nmillion live viewers, which was more\nviewers than there are who watch the Super\nBowl, which is quite surreal given each game is about\nfour or five hours long. So it's of intense. 35,000 press articles. So, incredibly, it\ncaused a shortage of the sale of Go boards, which\nwas also quite remarkable when you consider they're\nkind of bits of wood with some stones on top. So we're really excited\nabout the buzz and energy that it created. And, again, we were\nlucky enough to manage to get a Nature\npaper and, of course, lucky to get the front cover. The first machine learning AI\nlab to get two Nature front covers in 18 months. So it was really cool to\nbe able to do that work. But, of course,\nour real motivation is to develop these systems\nso that we can actually make progress on some of our\nmost intractable problems. That's what motivates\nus at DeepMind. That's what we're\nreally driven by. And, in fact, I think\nthat in some ways is what makes our\norganization so exceptional. I think the really smartest\npeople in the world want to work on the\nhardest problems with some of the other smartest people. But I think what's\nalso really important and becoming really clear I\nthink in the last five years at least is that those\npeople have the freedom to work on any\nproblem in the world. They can go to any\nlab or to any company, they can take their pick. And so what really makes a\ndifference is the opportunity to have meaningful social\nimpact in the world, and know that you are\nactually working hard to try to change the model\nof running an organization and change the\nmotivation and purpose of our typical\ninstitutional structures and do things quite differently. So we took the same\nkind of methods and we actually\ndeployed them to see if we could make Google's data\ncenters much more efficient. And what we did, so\nwe trained a model to look at all the past\nretrospective sensor data that describes how\nthe data center operates. And this includes data,\nthings like air pressure and temperature, incoming server\nload, and so on and so forth. And what we're able\nto do is train a model to use power more\nefficiently to deliver exactly the same performance. So there were no\nglitches I hope in any of your experience of watching\nYouTube or any of your search results. But all the while, we\nmanaged to deliver exactly the same performance by using\n40% less energy across all the data centers in order\nto cool the data centers. And so this is quite exciting\nbecause it gives us a hint that these kinds of very\nlarge learning methods can be used for very\nhard real-world problems. And I think one of the things\nwe're really excited about now is how we might\nbe able to deploy these very general\nalgorithms for load balancing on the national grid. And so these are really\ndifficult problems in data centers where there's\na massive action space and the real-world data\nis really, really noisy. And what we really need\nto do is design algorithms that can safely explore\ndifferent parameters in order to control very complex systems. And so, ultimately, what we're\nexcited about is the potential to use these same\nsystems in any building to predict incoming load and\nadjust the energy required to operate that piece of\ninfrastructure accordingly in order to optimally match them\nto consume only the energy that is necessary at the\nright time to run, say, a massive cooling facility\nor an industrial plant, or potentially even\na national grid. The other thing I\nwant to talk to you about is DeepMind Health. Earlier this year,\nin February, we launched our first business\nthat's facing outwards, looking at seeing how we\ncan deploy our technologies to radically transform the\nNHS, digitize, and then help better organize and run\nthe National Health Service. And at the moment, the\nmost remarkable thing that we discovered is\nthat there is actually an incredible amount\nof really rich data that describes your\nexperience when you're admitted in a hospital. It's collected very diligently. It's very comprehensive. But the challenge\nis that it sits in charts like this at\nthe bottom of your bed. And so this is, for\nexample, a fluid chart. This is a record of everything\nthat you've eaten that day. And there's all sorts of very\nrich data that in some sense describes you and your\nexperience in admission. This is your stool chart. This is a catheter\nchart coming up here. And all kinds of really\nuseful information that unfortunately is\nonly really ever accessed by the clinician when they\narrive at your bedside. And so they spend the\nfirst couple minutes flicking through\nthis information and basically asking you to\nrepeat the stuff that you've probably repeated many\ntimes before to the previous specialties, when\nyou admitted, what's wrong with you, who\nelse have you seen. And that's really\ndifficult for you as a patient to try to\nremember all of those things and have to repeat those things\nand present your own case history. The other kind of\ndata that exists is transmitted using pagers. It would be surprising\nI think to many people to realize that actually\nthis technology, which is many decades\nold, is still in use as the primary mechanism\nof communication today in the hospital. And the downside of these\nsystems, apart from the fact that they're very clunky and\nwhen you do get a message, you have to go and find a\ntelephone and phone back the person and\nthey may or may not be on the receiving\nend of that phone, and then you end up playing\npager ping with people. That's one of the downsides. But the other is that none\nof the information that's exchanged when clinicians are\ncommunicating with one another is actually recorded,\nand yet that's the most valuable information that\ndescribes what decision was taken when to diagnose you\nwith a particular condition, to decide that you need to\nundergo a particular procedure or a particular pathway of care. And so that's kind\nof lost to the ether. It's not recorded and it's not\npart of the information that can be used then to audit or\nto improve or to strengthen the quality of service\nthat you receive. And I think these two things\ncontribute significantly to some really\nshocking statistics. 10% of patients\nexperience some kind of harm, some kind of\nunnecessary harm, when they're admitted to hospital. And around half of those\npatients it's been estimated suffer that harm\nlargely because there's been a delay in the\nescalation of their care. And that essentially\nmeans that there's been poor communication,\npoor coordination, and very limited\naccess to the data that should otherwise describe\nthe kind of deteriorating condition that you're facing. And actually a really\ninteresting study came out earlier this\nyear from the BMJ that has estimated that\nmedical error is actually the third leading cause\nof death in the US. And so everybody thinks\nthat the numbers in the UK are very, very underestimated. Something like 250,000 people\ndie a year preventatively because of medical\nerror in the US. It's the third biggest killer. And so largely\nthere's two things that are driving the patient\nexperience in hospital. The first is how do we identify\nwhich patients are at risk of deterioration at any moment. And there's two or three\nsources of data here. There's the stuff\nthat already exists on the very clunky and painful\nand old school digital systems, as well as the\npaper-based record. And I think it would be very\nsurprising to most people, although not to many\nof the junior doctors and consultants and nurses\nwho work in the systems, to realize that actually\na lot of these systems, these desktop-based old school\nsystems that are in deployment at the moment, were actually\ndeveloped for completely different ecosystems. So firstly, largely in the US. And secondly, often\noriginally those systems were built for\nlogistics or accounting. So not really designed for\nhealth care from the ground up, thinking about the user\nneed all the way through. And so the first job is to\ntake advantage of all the data that currently exists, both\nthat which is digitized and that which needs\nto be digitized. And then secondly, use that to\nescalate care more effectively. So once you've\nidentified which patients are at risk of deterioration\nby looking at all the data, how do you manage\nthe coordination of that intervention\nmore effectively. And so let me take you\nthrough an example of what a truly digitized health care\nexperience might actually look like. Here we have our\npatient, Robert, who was admitted\nyesterday with a complaint of a severe abdominal pain. And so he was kept in\novernight for observations. And our ward nurse, Jamie,\nis taking his temperature. He's able to record\nthe temperature on his mobile phone,\non his iPhone. And it's really pretty simple. He's able to swipe\nacross, update the number, and immediately we see that\nthe temperature is actually 39.2 degrees. And so this is obviously\nsuper concerning. And it's generated what's called\nan Early Warning Score, which immediately triggers an\nalert to the doctor on call. She is able to read that\ninformation in the lift and immediately realize that\nactually this patient needs to be seen by me\nvery, very quickly. She scrubs through\non her mobile phone and looks up the\nname of the patient. So there's structured search\nacross all of the key features in the hospital. She can search by consultant,\nby ward, by specialty, she can search my medical\nrecord number or date of birth. And here she's typing in\nthe name of the patient. So she can pull up Robert\nJones and immediately view his profile. So this for the\nfirst time aggregates all of the data that is being\ncollected across the hospital system from the\npatient's perspective. And so what she's presented\nwith immediately is an overview. What is this\npatient's allergies? Why have they been admitted\nin this current episode? What are their\nunderlying diagnosis? She can see here that this\npatient's had tonsillitis, also suffers from asthma, in the\npast had a tonsilectomy. She can scrub down and see\nwhat medication they're on and she can see all\nof the observations and any other details that are\nrelevant and most immediately necessary in the overview. If she swipes across, she can\nsee a different stream of data. She can see the linear\ntimeline of everything that's happened to\nthis patient in order. So in the last few\nminutes, she can see that this patient's actually\ntriggered a sepsis alert. It looks like they\nmay be at risk of a very serious infection. They've got an\nacute kidney injury alert, which means\nthat they're probably dehydrated in their kidneys\nor are at great risk. We can see that they've\nbeen sent for bloods. The bloods have been ordered\nand they've been taken, but they've not\nyet been collected. So she doesn't have to call down\nto the pathology lab to say, is this blood test result ready. She can immediately\nsee on her mobile phone that actually this\nis a test that needs to be reviewed and examined. She can also see other\nradiology reports and any other\ninformation she needs. She can click on more detail\nto see every single blood test that's been taken\nabout this patient, look at trend analysis,\nlook at previous graphs, compare that with all of the\nother important statistics. So here as she can see that\nthe potassium has spiked. This patient has a dangerously\nhigh level of potassium rising, at 6.2. She can see that the white\nblood cell count is high, which probably means there's\nan infection and was probably why the sepsis alert was\ntriggered in the first place. She can also now, having\nknown that there's an sepsis risk, go\nand look in more detail at that\nradiology exam, where she can see that the report\nsays that there's a right lobe pneumonia. She can zoom in on that, compare\nthat to what she's seen before, and share it with a colleague\nand get a second opinion. And this has all happened before\nshe's arrived at the bedside. She's not even met\nthe patient yet. There's no need to arrive\nand look through the charts and then take a case history. She's done all of this in\nthe corridor, in the lift, and on her way\nthere so that she is prepped and ready to give\nher full human attention to that patient at the bedside. Now she's here and she's\nbeen able to examine Robert's condition. She can text her consultant\nand say actually this patient. Looks like they might need\nan appendectomy they probably basically just need\ntheir appendix out. And so her consultant\ncan-- so now what we've enabled is effective\nescalation by very fast real-time communication. And her consultant can\ntext back and confirm that actually this patient\ndoes need an appendectomy and we should start\ninstigating all of the jobs and procedures and tasks,\nboth automatic and human, that need to take place. So here we see Jamie,\nour ward nurse, texting back saying I'm\ngoing to go ahead and do the blood cultures and\nso on and so forth. So this is our consultant who's\npreparing for the operation. She's got her own\nphone and she's able to tap on admit the patient\nand prepare them for surgery. And automatically we see that\na whole series of subtasks get dispatched across\nthe whole hospital. So we can see that this patient\nneeds to be nil by mouth, they need intravenous\nfluids, someone needs to write up\nthe antibiotics, they need to be consented,\nand so on and so forth. And so all these jobs get\nsent to the right person so that they can be carried\nout at the right time. And obviously, following\nRobert's operation, we can still follow up with\nall of the live observations and results. Our clinician, our\nsurgeon, can still read through all\nof the information that she needs to see from home\nand keep tabs and communicate with her team so\nthat she can take care of the patient in a\nremote and ongoing way. But ultimately, what\nwe really want to do is put the patient in control. The patient owns\nthe data about her. And we want to make that\navailable on a personal mobile device so that he or she can\nplay a much more active role in administering their\ncare and potentially connect up other data\nsources to better manage their own conditions. And I really believe that\nthis kind of digitization has the potential to truly\ntransform health care. One of the big challenges that\nwe face in the world today is of obesity and diabetes. So 26% of prevalence of\ndiabetes among adults in England is massively rising. And you're much more\nlikely, in fact, you're 25 times more likely, to\nsuffer some kind of sight loss if you do have diabetes. And yet 98% of that sight\nloss is completely preventable if you can get in there\nearly and detect it. So these are\npreventable problems if we can get access to\nthe data in real time and identify who\nis at risk of that. So what we've been doing is\nworking with the Moorfields Eye Hospital to look\nat these OCT scans. So these are 3D videos\nof your eye, if you like. And one of the\nchallenges is that we have a 10x shortage of\nradiologists to actually review these images. And so there's massive\ndelays in detecting disease and this can lead to blindness. And so what we\nreally want to do is build algorithms that\ncan learn to identify the early signs of\nage-related macular degeneration,\ndiabetic retinopathy, and so on and so forth. And so this is an example\nof the kind of segmentation that we train our\nalgorithms to do. And this, I think,\nwill enable much more standardized analysis,\ninstant results with a continuously\nimproving methodology, and a scalable technology\nthat can be deployed across the entire system. We're also doing the\nsame kind of thing for improving radiotherapy\nso that we can do a better job of detecting cancer care. The same principle here\nis that we're really trying to make sure that\nthe right radiotherapy treatment is given to the right\npatient at the right time. And we can do that much more\nefficiently with algorithms. But, of course, for\nus, AI is about making remarkable progress. And we really do need to think\nabout the ethics and impact. And so we've been\nworking really hard to try to propagate\na set of principles about how we develop\nthese technologies. And the first is to say that\nwe think the benefits of AI should empower everybody, be\navailable to everybody, not some elite few who have\naccess to the resources to buy these technologies. We think that our\nresearch and development should be open and responsible\nand socially engaged. And we believe\nthat we really want to lead the way in establishing\ntechnical and governance best practices so that we can avoid\nthe most undesirable outcomes and we can create new\nkinds of organizations, in some sense, a\nsemi-permeable membrane where members of the public,\nmembers of people who are on the receiving\nend of our technologies can be involved in designing\nand governing our technologies and hold us accountable\nas we do that. So if you're interested in\ncontacting us and getting involved, I really\nwant to hear from you. I'm actually hiring for\nmy policy and ethics team at the moment.
