the","start":549.24,"duration":5.82},{"text":"answer is no for a number of reasons in","start":552.21,"duration":4.77},{"text":"an open reservoir there is more

it's","start":579.96,"duration":3.48},{"text":"almost like a double pane window you get","start":581.85,"duration":3.39},{"text":"that air gap in there and the air acts","start":583.44,"duration":3.66},{"text":"as an insulator and so the Sun never","start":585.24,"duration":3.33},{"text":"hits the water matter fact

go","start":615.36,"duration":4.08},{"text":"to remove them they're their recyclable","start":617.64,"duration":4.92},{"text":"material so but but we've figured

more...","start":102.9,"duration":1.52},{"text":"This is a pretty good guess,","start":106.42,"duration":1.68},{"text":"and I think the behavior is not exactly the same as the mystery cylinder,","start":108.1,"duration":4.12},{"text":"but it definitely is similar,","start":112.46,"duration":1.92},{"text":"and that's no coincidence.","start":114.72,"duration":1.64},{"text":"The mystery cylinder actually contains","start":116.68,"duration":3.34},{"text":"honey...","start":120.02,"duration":1.96},{"text":"and ping pong balls.","start":121.98,"duration":1.4},{"text":"There are two ping pong balls submerged in this honey.","start":123.38,"duration":4.3},{"text":"So if I place that on the ramp,","start":127.68,"duration":3.48},{"text":"the center of gravity is not above the point of contact with the ramp, and so it rolls forward,","start":131.46,"duration":6.16},{"text":"but now, because those ping pong balls are in the front,","start":137.62,"duration":4.02},{"text":"they change the center of gravity, and so it's exactly over the point of contact,","start":141.64,"duration":4.98},{"text":"and so it stops briefly,","start":147.06,"duration":1.6},{"text":"but then, as the viscosity of the honey allows those\nping pong balls to move up,","start":148.66,"duration":5.18},{"text":"the center of gravity shifts forwards again,\nallowing this little container to roll.","start":153.84,"duration":4.34},{"text":"So that is the trick of the mystery cylinder.","start":158.6,"duration":2.96},{"text":"Pretty

this.","start":187.54,"duration":2.84},{"text":"It's impossible.","start":190.38,"duration":1.18},{"text":"I mean, you might think I could run 3V\u2081 for my 2nd lap, and that would mean my total average speed is 2V\u2081.","start":191.56,"duration":6.7},{"text":"The problem is you can't just add the two speeds together and divide by two,","start":198.26,"duration":4.06},{"text":"because you spent much more time in your first lap, so that speed is weighted more heavily into the average,","start":202.32,"duration":6.06},{"text":"so you'd have to run, well, impossibly fast.","start":208.98,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Let me explain.","start":212.48,"duration":0.9},{"text":"The velocity of the first lap was the distance around the track divided by t\u2081, the time it took you.","start":213.38,"duration":5.64},{"text":"Now, if you want your total average speed to be 2V\u2081,","start":219.42,"duration":4.1},{"text":"well then it needs to be 2d \u00f7 t\u2081.","start":223.68,"duration":3.16},{"text":"You need to run twice the distance in the same amount of time it took you to run the first lap,","start":226.84,"duration":5.04},{"text":"but you've already run that first lap, and so you have\nno time remaining to run the second lap!","start":231.88,"duration":4.52},{"text":"Even if you went the speed of

the question about the train,","start":261.08,"duration":2.96},{"text":"was actually answered pretty well, with most people mentioning something to do with the

people though did point out that maybe it was the steam that was going backwards,","start":273.94,"duration":5.12},{"text":"or maybe air molecules in the train, \nand that is actually a pretty clever point,","start":279.34,"duration":4.14},{"text":"however I wouldn't really consider the air in the train part of the train,","start":283.48,"duration":4.14},{"text":"so indeed, the part of the train that is moving backwards","start":287.7,"duration":3.86},{"text":"is the flange part of the wheel,\nwhich is below the rail.","start":291.56,"duration":5.3},{"text":"That is the part of the train which is moving backwards.","start":297.08,"duration":2.86},{"text":"To understand why,\nyou just think about a spinning wheel.","start":299.94,"duration":3.36},{"text":"The top of the wheel is moving forwards at speed 2V,","start":303.3,"duration":2.82},{"text":"and the bottom of the wheel is not moving forward at all; it is stationary with respect to the track,","start":306.12,"duration":5.86},{"text":"and that is what we call \"rolling without slipping,\"\nand that's how most wheels work.","start":311.98,"duration":4.56},{"text":"At least, that's how they're designed to work.","start":316.54,"duration":1.86},{"text":"Now, in the case of trains, they have to have flanges so the train doesn't fall off its rails,","start":318.98,"duration":6.08},{"text":"but of course, when these pieces come around during the rotation of the wheel,","start":325.06,"duration":3.84},{"text":"they actually extend beyond the rail, and therefore,\nthey are going backwards with respect to the ground,","start":328.9,"duration":6.54},{"text":"so the part of the train that's moving backwards is always changing,","start":335.44,"duration":3.18},{"text":"but it's always that part of the flange,","start":338.8,"duration":2.64},{"text":"that part that extends beyond the wheel that is below the level of the track.","start":341.44,"duration":4.58},{"text":"So what happens when you pull\nthe bottom pedal of a bike backwards?","start":346.46,"duration":4.68},{"text":"Well, about 45% of you thought that\nthe bike would move backwards,","start":351.14,"duration":3.88},{"text":"about a quarter said it would move forwards,\nand a quarter said the bike wouldn't move at all,","start":355.02,"duration":5.62},{"text":"and 5% said it depends on something...","start":361.2,"duration":3.3},{"text":"So let's give it a shot and see what happens.","start":365.2,"duration":1.68},{"text":"I'm going to pull backwards on the bike pedal\nin 3, 2, 1...","start":366.88,"duration":5.2},{"text":"Woah!","start":375.82,"duration":0.7},{"text":"The bike did indeed move back,","start":376.52,"duration":2.34},{"text":"and for virtually all bikes, this is what you will find,","start":379.16,"duration":3.68},{"text":"but the explanation is not just as simple as\n\"well, the net force on the bike is back,","start":382.84,"duration":4.02},{"text":"so therefore, it has to accelerate backwards,\"","start":386.86,"duration":2.48},{"text":"and to prove that that logic doesn't work,\nwell, just have a look at this video by George Hart.","start":389.34,"duration":5.94},{"text":"[George] Watch this. \nAgain, I pull the same pedal backward, but now...","start":395.28,"duration":3.88},{"text":"the bike moves forward!","start":399.8,"duration":1.6},{"text":"[Derek] I'll put a link to the full video here\nand a link to his website in the description.","start":401.74,"duration":3.92},{"text":"So the reason the bike moves backwards is because of the way these gears are set up, the diameter of the tire,","start":405.66,"duration":6.1},{"text":"and also, the distance from this crank to the pedal itself.","start":411.76,"duration":4.26},{"text":"Because as a bike moves forwards,","start":416.3,"duration":3.12},{"text":"the pedal, even when you're pushing back on it, never actually moves backwards with respect to the ground;","start":419.94,"duration":6.06},{"text":"it's always moving forwards.","start":426.0,"duration":2.06},{"text":"[George] So if you drag a string\nbehind the pedal of a bike moving forward,","start":428.06,"duration":4.1},{"text":"the string is always moving forward.","start":432.16,"duration":2.74},{"text":"Now just play that movie backward in your mind,","start":434.9,"duration":2.54},{"text":"and it may be clear how pulling the string backward could make the bike move backward;","start":437.44,"duration":4.1},{"text":"They move forward together,\nso they move backward together.","start":441.54,"duration":2.4},{"text":"[Derek]\nAnother way to think about this","start":443.94,"duration":1.34},{"text":"is to consider the path traced out by the pedal\nas the bike moves forward.","start":445.28,"duration":3.9},{"text":"This is called the trochoid.","start":449.18,"duration":1.88},{"text":"For all ordinary bikes, \nthe pedals are moving much slower than the tires,","start":451.06,"duration":3.8},{"text":"so the pedal is always going forward\nwith respect to the ground,","start":454.86,"duration":3.92},{"text":"but George modified his bike","start":458.78,"duration":1.46},{"text":"so the ratio of the pedal to the wheel radius was greater than the ratio of the front sprocket to the back sprocket,","start":460.24,"duration":6.52},{"text":"and this ultra-low gear changes the trochoid\nso the pedal DOES actually go backwards","start":466.76,"duration":5.18},{"text":"with respect to the ground as the bike goes forwards,","start":471.94,"duration":3.7},{"text":"and that's why he could pull back on the pedal","start":475.64,"duration":1.98},{"text":"and make the bike go forwards.","start":477.62,"duration":2.22},{"text":"This is the same reason why if you were to pull backwards on the flange of a train wheel,","start":479.84,"duration":4.54},{"text":"you could actually get the train to move forwards,\nif you pulled backwards with enough force.","start":484.38,"duration":5.8},{"text":"For all normal bicycles, pulling back like this on the bottom pedal will cause the bicycle to move backwards,","start":490.18,"duration":5.82},{"text":"but, depending on the gear ratio,\nyou can get the bike to move forwards,","start":496.0,"duration":4.26},{"text":"so it was those people who said","start":500.26,"duration":1.88},{"text":"it depends on the ratio of these gears and the size of this crank to the radius of the back

that?","start":75.57,"duration":1.195},{"text":"- 'Cause...","start":76.765,"duration":1.252},{"text":"(boat engine drowns James voice)","start":78.017,"duration":1.833},{"text":"- These are actually\npartially filled with water,","start":79.85,"duration":2.65},{"text":"and the reason they are\nfilled with water is that,","start":82.5,"duration":2.31},{"text":"at LA Reservoir we have\nsome really high winds","start":84.81,"duration":2.12},{"text":"and so, you know, if we didn't\nput water into these things,","start":86.93,"duration":2.73},{"text":"there would be balls down\nbouncing on the 5 Freeway,","start":89.66,"duration":2.09},{"text":"people drive down, they'd\nbe all over the place.","start":91.75,"duration":1.88},{"text":"So, these keep the balls in the reservoir","start":93.63,"duration":2.58},{"text":"and if they do start to roll,","start":96.21,"duration":1.38},{"text":"they kind of wobble because\nthe water makes them uneven.","start":97.59,"duration":2.53},{"text":"- [Narrator] But that\nmakes them significantly","start":100.12,"duration":1.65},{"text":"more difficult to push out of the

the time.","start":176.779,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Most of the time?","start":177.612,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- [Hellen] Yes.","start":178.445,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Most of the time the\nwater is coming from here.","start":179.278,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- [Hellen] Correct, yes.","start":180.111,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Absolutely nuts.","start":180.944,"duration":0.833},{"text":"So why is LA Reservoir\ncovered in shade balls?","start":181.777,"duration":3.823},{"text":"Well, the the problem\nall started with Bromide.","start":185.6,"duration":2.62},{"text":"- Bromide is a naturally\noccurring substance.","start":188.22,"duration":2.62},{"text":"It's associated with salt water","start":190.84,"duration":1.98},{"text":"and so normally places\nlike California Aqueduct,","start":192.82,"duration":4.05},{"text":"that comes down from the Delta.","start":196.87,"duration":1.67},{"text":"You get some some salt water intrusions,","start":198.54,"duration":1.43},{"text":"so you have some Bromide in the water.","start":199.97,"duration":1.54},{"text":"Bromide's harmless and it's\nalmost impossible to remove.","start":201.51,"duration":3.113},{"text":"But, when you disinfect\nthe water with Ozone,","start":204.623,"duration":3.297},{"text":"that Bromide becomes Bromate.","start":207.92,"duration":2.52},{"text":"And Bromate is carcinogenic.","start":210.44,"duration":1.31},{"text":"And so around the year\n2000 they wrote regulations","start":211.75,"duration":3.26},{"text":"regulating Bromate.","start":215.01,"duration":0.95},{"text":"And the regulation basically said,","start":215.96,"duration":1.8},{"text":"if you have a treatment\nplant that uses Ozone,","start":217.76,"duration":2.35},{"text":"then you have to watch\nyour Bromate formation.","start":220.11,"duration":2.76},{"text":"Be careful not to form too much.","start":222.87,"duration":1.21},{"text":"So, the only places we\never measured Bromate","start":224.08,"duration":2.14},{"text":"was at our filter plant.","start":226.22,"duration":1.33},{"text":"- [Narrator] And the results\nwere always within the","start":227.55,"duration":1.65},{"text":"10 micrograms per liter\nlimit set by regulators.","start":229.2,"duration":3.28},{"text":"So they were confused when they got a call","start":232.48,"duration":1.87},{"text":"from one of their customers,\na beverage company in LA.","start":234.35,"duration":3.05},{"text":"- They said, \"We have\nsome really high levels","start":237.4,"duration":1.83},{"text":"of Bromate showing up,\nare you aware of this?\"","start":239.23,"duration":2.01},{"text":"And we said, \"Well, we\ndon't show anything.\"","start":241.24,"duration":2.43},{"text":"- [Narrator] But between\nthe filtration plant","start":243.67,"duration":1.51},{"text":"and the customer was the reservoir.","start":245.18,"duration":2.4},{"text":"So they did some tests.","start":247.58,"duration":2.15},{"text":"- Almost immediately upon coming","start":249.73,"duration":1.4},{"text":"into to this open reservoir,","start":251.13,"duration":1.5},{"text":"the Bromate levels jumped.","start":252.63,"duration":1.97},{"text":"It turned out that Bromide with Chlorine,","start":254.6,"duration":2.94},{"text":"which was supposed to be safe,","start":257.54,"duration":1.42},{"text":"in bright sunlight formed Bromate","start":258.96,"duration":2.32},{"text":"even more than Ozone did.","start":261.28,"duration":1.77},{"text":"And so we made the unfortunate\nscientific discovery","start":263.05,"duration":2.693},{"text":"that actually was not part\nof any regulatory scheme.","start":265.743,"duration":3.267},{"text":"And so, here we are at the reservoir,","start":269.01,"duration":2.39},{"text":"we have a water source that's\ngot Bromide in it, harmless,","start":271.4,"duration":3.12},{"text":"we have chlorine, we have to\nhave to disinfect the water","start":274.52,"duration":2.6},{"text":"and we have sunlight because it's open.","start":277.12,"duration":1.99},{"text":"The only choice we have\nis to remove sunlight.","start":279.11,"duration":1.62},{"text":"So, we looked at all sorts of things.","start":280.73,"duration":1.93},{"text":"We looked at floating\ntarps across the water,","start":282.66,"duration":3.1},{"text":"and normally, you put a\nfloating cover on the water","start":285.76,"duration":1.59},{"text":"but that's a multi-year project.","start":287.35,"duration":2.19},{"text":"And so we said, \"Well, can we manufacture","start":289.54,"duration":1.43},{"text":"these kind of trampoline\nwith poly-like PVC pipe?\"","start":290.97,"duration":3.03},{"text":"And we said, \"Well, they'll\njust gonna become bird perches","start":294.0,"duration":1.75},{"text":"and we'll have a big\nwater quality problem.\"","start":295.75,"duration":1.837},{"text":"Then we knew we had\nhigh-density polyethylene pipe,","start":297.587,"duration":3.823},{"text":"which is used in the water industry,","start":301.41,"duration":1.67},{"text":"and we know that it floats.","start":303.08,"duration":1.84},{"text":"We at one point thought about","start":304.92,"duration":1.19},{"text":"can we get float a pile of\npipe across the surface.","start":306.11,"duration":2.03},{"text":"Well, that's hard to do and very expensive","start":308.14,"duration":2.57},{"text":"'cause it's a lot of material.","start":310.71,"duration":1.44},{"text":"So maybe we can take some pipe","start":312.15,"duration":0.833},{"text":"and we can run it through a chipper","start":312.983,"duration":1.287},{"text":"and we can make a debris\nfield across the surface,","start":314.27,"duration":2.24},{"text":"like the back corner of a lake somewhere.","start":316.51,"duration":2.38},{"text":"But, then you have all\nthis mushy, warm water","start":318.89,"duration":2.3},{"text":"with plastic floating on the top","start":321.19,"duration":1.38},{"text":"and that however sounds like a Petri dish.","start":322.57,"duration":1.87},{"text":"And so low and behold, Dr. Bryan White,","start":324.44,"duration":2.19},{"text":"did some research and\nhe found the shade ball.","start":326.63,"duration":3.294},{"text":"(tranquil music)","start":329.924,"duration":1.766},{"text":"- [Narrator] Except they\nweren't called shade balls","start":331.69,"duration":1.97},{"text":"at the time.","start":333.66,"duration":0.876},{"text":"(tranquil music)","start":334.536,"duration":1.474},{"text":"- This product existed and\nthey were called bird balls","start":336.01,"duration":3.2},{"text":"and they used it on ponds\nthat had mine tailings,","start":339.21,"duration":3.73},{"text":"where they didn't want waterfowl\nto go in and get poisoned.","start":342.94,"duration":2.68},{"text":"And also around airports\nwhere there are ponds","start":345.62,"duration":2.248},{"text":"and they want to keep the waterfowl off","start":347.868,"duration":1.652},{"text":"so they didn't take off\nand get into jet engines.","start":349.52,"duration":2.557},{"text":"(airplane engine roaring)","start":352.077,"duration":2.691},{"text":"You know they have actually\ndone wind tunnel testing","start":354.768,"duration":1.642},{"text":"and they blew, you know,\n50, 60 mile of winds across","start":356.41,"duration":3.041},{"text":"so they could see how they'd behave.","start":359.451,"duration":1.549},{"text":"But, they were really made\nto deter birds and wildlife","start":361.0,"duration":2.27},{"text":"from sitting on the water.","start":363.27,"duration":1.19},{"text":"- [Narrator] Did there used\nto be birds landing here more?","start":364.46,"duration":2.55},{"text":"- Absolutely, yes.","start":367.01,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- [Narrator] Yeah?","start":367.843,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Yeah.","start":368.676,"duration":0.833},{"text":"Once we deployed these balls,","start":369.509,"duration":0.833},{"text":"all the birds were gone.","start":370.342,"duration":1.368},{"text":"They used to just hangout, right?","start":371.71,"duration":2.06},{"text":"Loiter at the curbs.","start":373.77,"duration":1.18},{"text":"- Yeah, they'd be all\nover the top of the dam.","start":374.95,"duration":2.392},{"text":"- [Hellen] You could see\nbirds dropping everywhere.","start":377.342,"duration":1.278},{"text":"- [James] They'd be down\nat the outlet tower,","start":378.62,"duration":2.02},{"text":"they'd be everywhere.","start":380.64,"duration":0.99},{"text":"We don't get 'em anymore like we used to.","start":381.63,"duration":2.48},{"text":"- [Narrator] But before\nbeing added to the reservoir,","start":384.11,"duration":1.67},{"text":"the shade balls had to be tested.","start":385.78,"duration":2.15},{"text":"Would they actually reduce\nthe formation of Bromate?","start":387.93,"duration":2.79},{"text":"- And we bought three kiddie pools,","start":390.72,"duration":1.956},{"text":"three little inflatable kiddie pools.","start":392.676,"duration":1.884},{"text":"And we filled them all\nwith the reservoir water.","start":394.56,"duration":1.99},{"text":"One was in the sunlight,\none we put a tarp on","start":396.55,"duration":1.423},{"text":"and one put shade balls on.","start":397.973,"duration":2.317},{"text":"And amazingly, the shade balls knocked out","start":400.29,"duration":2.15},{"text":"the problem immediately.","start":402.44,"duration":1.79},{"text":"- [Narrator] So the reason\nshade balls are black","start":404.23,"duration":1.84},{"text":"is to block all light\nfrom reaching the water","start":406.07,"duration":2.17},{"text":"and triggering the Bromate reaction.","start":408.24,"duration":2.3},{"text":"The black pigment is also safe","start":410.54,"duration":1.5},{"text":"for contact with drinking water","start":412.04,"duration":1.34},{"text":"and it's stable even exposed\nto the elements for years.","start":413.38,"duration":3.76},{"text":"- They're black for a reason so, you know,","start":417.14,"duration":2.06},{"text":"they're made out of a\nhigh-density polyethylene.","start":419.2,"duration":1.94},{"text":"It's the same material that","start":421.14,"duration":1.42},{"text":"like a gallon milk jug is made out of.","start":422.56,"duration":2.0},{"text":"It's a food grade plastic","start":424.56,"duration":1.59},{"text":"and they would be clear\nlike a milk carton,","start":426.15,"duration":2.04},{"text":"except that they wouldn't last in the sun.","start":428.19,"duration":2.1},{"text":"And so, they have a material\ncalled carbon black in them","start":430.29,"duration":2.66},{"text":"and that's what makes the plastic last","start":432.95,"duration":2.28},{"text":"for at least 10 years out in the sun.","start":435.23,"duration":1.58},{"text":"We did test to see","start":436.81,"duration":1.146},{"text":"if there is any other colors we could use.","start":437.956,"duration":1.934},{"text":"So we actually had the company make","start":439.89,"duration":2.2},{"text":"three different shades of blue,","start":442.09,"duration":1.11},{"text":"but the dyes were so unstable they said,","start":443.2,"duration":2.197},{"text":"\"We can't guarantee it's\ngonna last more than a year.\"","start":445.397,"duration":2.183},{"text":"And so, it's that carbon black","start":447.58,"duration":1.567},{"text":"that's the magic powder in this","start":449.147,"duration":2.173},{"text":"that really makes this\nproduct last in the sunlight.","start":451.32,"duration":2.35},{"text":"One of the concerns\nthat people raised to me","start":453.67,"duration":2.03},{"text":"when we put first these on, it was that,","start":455.7,"duration":2.2},{"text":"are they gonna get hot and\nthen bleach the material out?","start":457.9,"duration":2.47},{"text":"And they don't.","start":460.37,"duration":0.833},{"text":"They're totally inert.","start":461.203,"duration":0.947},{"text":"I mean, theoretically, you could cut off","start":462.15,"duration":1.41},{"text":"a piece of this ball\nand you could chew it,","start":463.56,"duration":1.8},{"text":"no harm comes to you.","start":465.36,"duration":0.92},{"text":"This is totally food grade,","start":466.28,"duration":1.98},{"text":"nothing wrong with it whatsoever.","start":468.26,"duration":1.213},{"text":"- [Narrator] What's it like\ndriving through these things?","start":469.473,"duration":1.723},{"text":"- It's difficult.","start":471.196,"duration":1.514},{"text":"As you can see we've\nbeen sitting here for,","start":472.71,"duration":1.915},{"text":"well, I don't know how\nlong, quite a while,","start":474.625,"duration":2.165},{"text":"and there's a breeze and we haven't moved.","start":476.79,"duration":2.29},{"text":"I mean anybody that knows,","start":479.08,"duration":0.96},{"text":"that's been on a boat in a lake,","start":480.04,"duration":1.21},{"text":"if there's a slight breeze\nand you're on a boat,","start":481.25,"duration":1.71},{"text":"you're drifting, right?","start":482.96,"duration":1.45},{"text":"Not here.","start":484.41,"duration":0.833},{"text":"This thing, they're just stable.","start":485.243,"duration":2.527},{"text":"They're (indistinct)","start":487.77,"duration":1.5},{"text":"It's interesting when\nyou try to pilot the boat","start":489.27,"duration":2.07},{"text":"through these things, its difficult.","start":491.34,"duration":1.56},{"text":"- [Narrator] It's like\ndriving through peanut butter","start":492.9,"duration":1.05},{"text":"or something?","start":493.95,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Or something, I guess, yeah.","start":494.783,"duration":1.247},{"text":"Not that I've ever done that but...","start":496.03,"duration":1.409},{"text":"(laughing)","start":497.439,"duration":1.121},{"text":"- [Narrator] Blocking\nsunlight from the reservoir","start":498.56,"duration":1.69},{"text":"also provided additional benefits.","start":500.25,"duration":2.37},{"text":"- You know, one of the reasons\nwe put so much Chlorine","start":502.62,"duration":1.75},{"text":"was to control the algae growth.","start":504.37,"duration":1.3},{"text":"But sometimes you still\ncouldn't control it.","start":505.67,"duration":2.07},{"text":"There were times years ago, in the summer,","start":507.74,"duration":2.56},{"text":"where if we had an algae outbreak,","start":510.3,"duration":1.93},{"text":"you might actually, if\nyou filled a bath tub up,","start":512.23,"duration":2.01},{"text":"you might have a slight tinge of green.","start":514.24,"duration":1.48},{"text":"I mean, it maybe healthy to drink,","start":515.72,"duration":1.5},{"text":"but it might have a slight\ntinge of green from the algae.","start":517.22,"duration":1.84},{"text":"- [Narrator] You'd see a bit of algae.","start":519.06,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Yeah, and it's just\ndiscoloring the water.","start":519.893,"duration":1.517},{"text":"That no longer occurs.","start":521.41,"duration":0.97},{"text":"So, with the sunlight gone,","start":522.38,"duration":2.33},{"text":"the algae problem is gone.","start":524.71,"duration":1.46},{"text":"We put in, basically, no Chlorine.","start":526.17,"duration":1.27},{"text":"We've only had a few times\nsince the shade balls","start":527.44,"duration":2.03},{"text":"have been on LA Reservoir,","start":529.47,"duration":0.833},{"text":"that we've added any Chlorine at all.","start":530.303,"duration":1.577},{"text":"And we used to do half the Chlorine","start":531.88,"duration":1.37},{"text":"and the whole water system","start":533.25,"duration":1.26},{"text":"went into that reservoir\njust to control algae growth.","start":534.51,"duration":2.63},{"text":"- [Narrator] But the big\nconcern I had was evaporation.","start":537.14,"duration":3.18},{"text":"When I first heard about\nthese black plastic balls","start":540.32,"duration":2.29},{"text":"reducing evaporation, it\ndidn't seem to make any sense.","start":542.61,"duration":3.23},{"text":"I mean, wouldn't they absorb more energy","start":545.84,"duration":2.02},{"text":"and so heat up the water,\nleading to faster evaporation?","start":547.86,"duration":3.407},{"text":"It turns out the answer is, no,","start":551.267,"duration":1.933},{"text":"for a number of reasons.","start":553.2,"duration":1.87},{"text":"In an open reservoir, there\nis more exposed surface area","start":555.07,"duration":2.75},{"text":"where water molecules\ncan escape into the air.","start":557.82,"duration":2.65},{"text":"Plus, there is greater air\nflow over the water's surface","start":560.47,"duration":2.66},{"text":"continually removing\nthe layer of moist air","start":563.13,"duration":2.26},{"text":"and replacing it with dryer\nair, increasing evaporation.","start":565.39,"duration":3.69},{"text":"Now the shade balls do absorb more energy","start":569.08,"duration":2.29},{"text":"and get hotter on

pretty famous laws of motion and they're not very complicated but if I told them to you as clearly as I can you would think that you're understanding them but I think you wouldn't and the reason is everyone has ideas about physics and about how objects move before they're ever taught anything in a science classroom so rather than tell you Newton's three laws of motion I would like to tell you Derrick's three incorrect laws of motion which the ones I think you're actually thinking so Derek's first incorrect law of motion is an object with no unbalanced forces acting on it will naturally come to rest Derrick's second incorrect law of motion is that an unbalanced force causes an object to move with a constant velocity we could express this in an equation where the unbalanced force F equals the mass M times the velocity V so if you double the force the velocity also doubles it's just like being in a car as you press on the accelerator you increase the force on the car and therefore you move to a new higher constant speed Derek's third incorrect law of motion is that larger objects apply larger forces to smaller objects when a large truck slams into a car on a highway the force of the truck on the car is much greater than the force of the car back on the truck or you think about the earth and the moon the force with which the earth attracts the moon is greater than the force with which the moon attracts the earth but remember this is an incorrect law of motion","_Z0X0yE8Ioc":"what is the difference between mass and weight I think it's something that a lot of people are confused about they just think that anything that's big like this car has a lot of weight it's very heavy it's got a lot of mass and people just basically think of these ideas as all the same but there's an important distinction between the terms mass and weight mass refers to the amount of matter in an object whereas weight is a force it's the gravitational attraction that the object feels towards in this case the Earth's center so I've got a little experiment today where I brought my car out here and ask some people why is it difficult to push my car and my bet is their answer will be because the car is heavy you gonna say heavy it's a pencil but I'm the or down hill but you know the cars heavy big rock you would think would be heavy anything to speak you would think would be heavy too heavy oh it's bit lighter than I thought it's got its weight weight is responsible what is weight weight is massive in a gravity what is this gravity thing gravity is what I hate full of the core of the earth your car is pulled towards it at the center of the earth yes but now when you push it let's say you're pushing your car you're not pushing it up you know I mean but it's still hard to push yeah so do you think weights responsible for making it hard to push well it is white I mean like a lot of the counties used to push so yeah like weight and the exhibiter gravity on the mat but I'm not trying to lift the car right I'm just trying to push it like that big rock you would think would be heavy anything to speak you would think would be heavy so Chi but I'm not lifting it I'm pushing it so also gravity of it I suppose but this is this is my question right yeah but I'm not trying to lift it no that's true but it's still it's still hard to push so why is that because like if I lift it I understand you saying it's heavy yeah and it would be really hard but we're pushing and we're actually getting it to go so how does that work the answer is because the car has inertia inertia means that objects with mass have a tendency to resist changes in their motion I thought she had a great answer when I started which was inertia can you tell us about that what is what scenarios like wants something stopped it doesn't really want to go and when something's going doesn't matter yeah well the idea that I'm trying to get at is there's actually two different things right one thing is that there's a force pulling this down into the earth and that's what we call weight and that makes it impossible to lift but there's something else which is called inertia and that means something is difficult to change its motion the car's got a lot of inertia and that's why it's difficult to push which is different than why it's difficult to lift which is the weight force pulling it down towards the earth fair enough but it's actually not as difficult to push it it's not that hard yeah I know it doesn't even prove my point because I push it with one hearing K yeah","txmKr69jGBk":"let's switch it on let's see what it does through this coil of thick wire we're about to pass a huge alternating electric current on top is a 1 kilogram aluminium plate so we hear this noise what's that noise is the vibration of the plate because it's we're waiting at the two times the frequency of the son of difference 1 whoa whoa how does it do that to find out I've come to the place where it all started the Royal Institution in London this is the key to Faraday's magnetic lab amazing that locks to work from day seen $70 became a storeroom which is why it survived and it survived intact all the joinery chocolate row magnet exactly the same as Faraday so this is exactly as Faraday would have perhaps what yep in Faraday's time it was known that electric current creates a magnetic field but it remained an open question whether the reverse is possible if a magnetic field could generate electric current Faraday answered this question with his most famous apparatus father's electromagnetic induction ring which is this in August 1831 Faraday wrapped two coils of insulated wire around this iron ring but 1831 you could not go down to your local that hardware shop and aspect centimeters in safety while you had to in say the wire as you went and so as you pushed and pulled the wire about the ring you had to insulate it it takes 10 working days which is a huge investment of time but the investment paid off when Faraday connected a battery to one of the coils he saw a brief pulse of current in the other coil and when he disconnected the battery he saw a pulse of current in the other direction he realized that current was induced in the second coil only when the magnetic field through it was changing and if they hadn't been wrapped on the same ring Faraday may have noticed that the two coils repel each other when the current is induced and that's due to the interaction of their magnetic fields which brings us back to this through the bottom coil we are passing a huge electric current 800 amps which alternates in Direction 900 times per second this ensures there will always be a changing magnetic field above the coil instead of a second coil we're using the aluminium plate but the principle is the same the changing magnetic field induces currents in the plate that create an opposing magnetic field so it levitates ha ha ha how awesome is this this current is not only good for levitating the plate they can also make light bulbs glow the gift oh thank you oh that is go look too close because it's here we can I put it there yep and just as current in a toaster element heats it up the induced current in the plate dissipates its energy as heat if you have yet to see them check out how hot this plate is oh that is nuts is this your favorite demo they could say about the cool tell me this is not the best dinner table centerpiece it levitates it gives you light and you can cook on it and all the while you're demonstrating Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction where do I get that matter to grow this we can save the grain steps or any goodness you have those ions in it it means we can break down a greater distance of air goodness it's pretty conductivity why isn't there a big hole around the tree where it's taking out over soil there's this a gradually let the soil has time to recover","a7_8Gc_Llr8":"okay what is a candle flame really made of I'm at the Palace of discovery in Paris to do an experiment that beautifully demonstrates the answers you conduct oblast russia b- Mo Rocca pursue phenomena pendulums electric cell uses Sharjah Bruce okay so we're turning an electric field here you can see that the flame is spreading out kind of low voltage you see ah do i zap it way than me and I mean prevent aw no way a few but de anza pick up where I want papi you wait that's very cute it's like a butterfly our la flama sit on plasma sit on a media total movie on easy and you can see that the flame has two separate pieces to it now one is going towards the negative plate those would be the positive ions and the negative ions will be going towards a positively charged plate so we see the flame kind of flattening out but if that didn't convince you that a flame contains ions then check out part 2 of our experiment where we compare the conductivity of a flame to the conductivity of air which is normally a pretty good insulator it requires about ten thousand volts to break down a centimeter of air so right now this plate is at about 10,000 you see that the spark is only a little but if I put it around the flame we'll see we can get a bigger spark to happen look at that yeah because the flame has those ions in it it means that we can break down a greater distance of hair there's greater conductivity that's awesome you love doing this right yeah a strong enough electric field can actually extinguish the flame but watch carefully what happens when the flame goes out my god wait wait wait okay yeah if you are the Daisy owned on the phone read the cafe just like in the flame the opposite charges in the smoke are pulled in opposite directions now while some may argue that a flame is not truly a plasma because it's not hot enough and it doesn't have high enough density of ions one thing is for sure it does contain ions which have important electrical properties which can be demonstrated if you have a strong enough electric field there we go oh now the perfect time you see that it's just that easy maybe we should have a look at that in slow motion excite the","rM04U5BO3Ug":"boiling point is something that we normally think of as a stable property of a substance but it really depends on what the pressure is around the substance so for example water only boils at 100 degrees Celsius if the pressure is one atmosphere so if you reduce the pressure then those water molecules that are going quite quickly can easily escape from the water if there's no pressure pushing down on them so you can get water to boil at room temperature this is really boiling water the funny thing about boiling water at room temperature is that it actually decreases the temperature of the water that's because all of the fastest water molecules escape leaving only the slow ones behind will refrigerating the water refrigerate in the water by boiling it yes yes that is a cool content I know everyone's a big fan of liquid nitrogen but I've never seen solid nitrogen so we use the same trick pumping out the very fastest nitrogen molecules and eventually that decreased the temperature enough that the nitrogen actually froze not blue little bit oh wait SEC what I'm putting a thermocouple in there so we can measure the temperature of our liquid nitrogen and it reads okay so the temperature of our liquid nitrogen is about minus 196 Celsius which is exactly what it should be and now we're going to evacuate the chain we're going to suck the air out of there you can see that the the nitrogen is boiling okay oh yeah it's a brighter roots the temperatures dropping - 199 - 200 we're coming up on the triple point of nitrogen yeah I don't know no no maybe not we pass cuckoo doula oh yeah joy on we are forming solid nitrogen it has had some pretty beat whoa yeah so you do the ice is actually getting sucked up by the reduced pressure up here and there's a higher pressure underneath the ice because the vacuum pump hasn't had a chance to work there I've never seen solid nitrogen before so don't eat a it Bruce elevator Lizotte lakita heights on Pluto Angeles on floater right he seemed dubious on dessert the decor shamefully a Zulu ha ha ha cool bro after creating the solid nitrogen we poured it onto a water bath and we got the whole surface so cold that carbon dioxide actually condensed out of the atmosphere and we formed solid carbon dioxide dry ice on the surface of the water today prepare a super chip is Easter Sunday class on Sunday gasps oh hey

matters","gM3zP72-rJE":"I'm going to try to demonstrate something called regulation which is where you provide a pressure onto ice and that turns it into water but after that pressure is removed it freezes again so in order to demonstrate this I've taken apart the high E string from my guitar I chose the e string because it's stinner than a g string and that's important and I've waited it with these two bottles of water when I apply the string across the ice we should see the wire start to cut through the ice and perform the regulation of the ice well we'll see if it works because we are outside in Sydney and it's warmer than zero degrees obviously alright it's past 3:00 again but the experiment has been a success I passed this wire through this giant block of ice and it's still a solid block you can actually see the point where the wire went through here so we pretty clearly demonstrated read relation the idea that you can compress the ice turn it into water and then when that pressure is gone it solidifies again as ice pretty cool stuff","2xKZRpAsWL8":"so today I'm at the University of Sydney with dr. Phil Dooley and we're talking about how our idea of the atom change from a tiny little hard sphere to something more complicated and this apparatus is something to do with that exactly exactly it was quite a quite a landmark historical experiment it's just made of a tube of glass connected to a vacuum pump and in the tube of glass there are two pieces of metal connected to a high-voltage power supply so so we can suck the air out of here that's right and then apply high voltage to two metal plates yes normally with high voltage in air we don't get anything except maybe a big spark but what we what Geisler found who did this in 1857 was something quite different so should we have a look let's do it okay let's turn on the pump and the high volts turn off the lights so we can see what's going on as you can see something's happening now yeah I see a bit of a pink glow in there that's right so imagine guys for the first person to ever see this it's pretty surprising that started people thinking what is this stuff that's coming from the cathode seem to be a ray emitted from this negatively charged one which they called the cathode therefore it's called a cathode ray and it became the topic for research for the next 40 years as all the big bigwigs of physics and science basically tried to work out what was going on so what did they figure out I mean what is going on what's producing this this glow here there were two main camps one thought that it was waves and the second thought that the electricity was being carried by a stream of charged particles over the next 40 years they basically came to the conclusion well it was JJ Thompson in 1897 who came up with the idea that there is a stream of very small charged particles negatively charged they're smaller than an atom so the smallest atom hydrogen atom they're about one thousandth of the size of that and it doesn't matter what material it's the metal is it's always the same particle so this particle appears to be in everything and yeah this electron as it was as it was known is what's carrying the electricity so Thomson came to the conclusion that all atoms have this particle as one of their constituents that's right that's right so it wasn't a billiard ball there had to be something inside the billiard ball hmm so how do I picture like a billiard ball with bits inside of them well you should probably think about a pudding a pudding yeah well that's what his idea was that it was a plum pudding very dear to every British person's heart that and inside the pudding you have plums and plums can come out of that so when you apply a high voltage then a negatively charged electron which Thompson pictured as a plum comes out and leaves behind positively charged pudding are you a fan of plum pudding are for research purposes definitely okay all right well let's see if we can research this a little further okay that sounds like fun","cY-kiddvAg0":"electricity is one of our most faithful servants

time so there's a link to his video down in the description find a way to load both of these videos and then synchronize them on my mark in five four three two one in Sydney Australia we are at 34 degrees south latitude which is the opposite side of the world from Huntsville Alabama so which way to the toilets flush that is the question The Simpsons did a whole episode based on toilets flushing the opposite direction in Australia plus other shows have supposedly demonstrated this effect so is this a real effect or not the application of this principle to draining water in Earth's two hemispheres is just bunk if you try it yourself you'll find inconsistent results this sink sometimes drains one way and sometimes the other way in any container of water there's always going to be some rotation the water is not perfectly still and it is this rather than the hemisphere that determines which way the water will swirl down the drain but what if we could eliminate all motion from the water I have here a five foot wide kiddie pool actually fill the pool in the anti-clockwise direction to be sure that any clockwise motion we see is not due to the way I filled the pool I've left this water sitting here for 24 hours so it seems like I've damped all of the motions from the filling I really hope this works Destin wish me luck I'm about to pull the plug three two one and the pool is draining but you can't see any motion of the water just yet to help us see where the water is flowing I'm going to put some food coloring in on the four cardinal directions around the pool you you can clearly see that the water is flowing clockwise in this direction and that makes sense because that's how it should flow in the southern hemisphere due to the Earth's rotation but you can see what a tiny little effect it is and what extraordinary lengths I had to go to to see this effect so really you're not going to see it in a bathtub and you're not going to see it in a sink or in a toilet because there are other sources of angular momentum that totally wash out this effect the Coriolis effect there you have it it works to understand how it works imagine a pool with one edge touching the South Pole the pool is stationary relative to Earth but every day it's actually completing one full revolution now you can see the side of the pool furthest from the pole travels much farther every day than the side right next to the pole so the outer side of the pool is moving fastest towards the east and as you get closer to the pole the velocity decreases down to zero now imagine we drain the pool water from the far side is moving too fast relative to the drain and so it gets out ahead whereas water from near the pole is going too slow and so it lags behind so when the water approaches the drain it swirls clockwise and this is the reason cyclone swirl clockwise in the southern hemisphere the higher pressure air rushes into the eye of the storm and just like in our pool swirls in the direction dictated by the hemisphere and that's the truth about toilet swirl I definitely learned something and if unit 2 then you should share these videos with your friends so you

three years and it feels so good to have it finally out there in the world I hope you enjoyed it as much as we enjoyed making it alright I'll see you next time you you","M34TO71SKGk":"I'm here today calculating PI with darts with the help of veritasium so we're calculating PI using this which is a target composed of a square and a circle inside the square that has a diameter the same length as one side of the square so the idea of calculating PI like this is that the number of darts that land in the circle divided by the number of darts that land in the entire square should be proportional to the area of the circle divided by the area of a square if the length of one side of the square is 1 that means the area of the square is 1 that means the radius of the circle is 1\/2 so the area of the circle is PI R squared so it's PI over 4 therefore if we multiply the ratio of the number of darts that land inside the circle divided by the number of darts total by 4 we should get PI so how do we do we didn't do great we divide circles by the total is 103 yeah 88 by 103 and then we multiply by 4 yes is it bad no it's kind of funny three point four one oh that is higher than PI that suggests that we're getting more of our random samples inside the circle than we should I don't know randomness is a tough thing to see right that look random to you what doesn't look random is this whole section right here I do I do think these are centrally distributed yeah rather than evenly spread so we gotta try something else mm-hmm we could try a bigger one and just try to be more random huh how do you try to be more random we can throw a lot of darts in the short amount of time the Sun is setting we really need to make this map you'll let me I'll do my multi darts you can do your multi dose or you can do eight darts at once three two one I really don't know about this because I'm ridiculous it is you don't even know how ridiculous this is like that this yeah well how do you hold one day I don't know but this is crazy oh look at that oh yeah why does anyone buy a dartboard when you could do this when you could make one dollar store circles - here is the moment of truth we have 146 in the circle over a total number of a hundred and seventy nine hmm then we're multiplied by four and we should see pie three point two six yeah slightly better than our estimates all day I feel like there are better ways to measure pie than throwing darts at a board don't do this method kids I'm warning you this is not a good idea so we're gonna find the accurate value of pi using dice today I am so hopeful new day new game plan I've drawn this pattern for Diana but she doesn't know what it looks like that is to avoid her trying to aim at anything so we're gonna put this on the fence with it facing away from her so she won't really know what she's trying to hit I try to aim as randomly as I can all over this board alright not bad it's pretty random to me well done why don't we rotate the fence 90 degrees this way there's some sort of systematic error in the way that we are throwing this should fix it right one oh so you wanna take the board off the fence and see how we did we're taking it off so my guess is it's right here ready uh-huh okay go for it oh I like this I like the grid I figured this one with a strategy that we decided yesterday where we wanted to have up-and-downs be able to hit like yeah plus you know we've got a center one that is probably gonna be very dense and then we've got radially outer ones which I thought would be less dense 80-85 after trying so many different methods it's now after sunset on the second day of trying to calculate pi with darts so what is our estimate of Pi three point one three nine three point one thirty-nine yeah that is awesome oh my gosh check that out different have a different is that from actual pi what percentage error is n divided by PI na point zero seven percent like point one percent if you end up mmm there which is pretty good if you're calculating PI with darts right huh I'm pretty happy with I am really happy with this we spent two days of Reliance happy pi day to you happy pi day to you","vhRjMFRChSg":"hey guys it's Lizzie everyday here at YouTube nation we're finding you the best videos that are out there and now we're also bringing you some of the top creators today I am so excited because we have Derek Muller aka veritasium here in the office science veritasium has well over a million and a half subscribers probably because derek explores some of the most interesting science questions you could ever dream up by partnering with Verizon for this series were able to explore the choices these creators have made that have helped them get from their first videos all the way up to where they are today hi YouTube nation i'm derek i make a youtube channel called veritasium which is all about science when I first started my youtube channel I had this idea that I was going to start with the simplest concepts in science and work methodically up building up a picture of the universe but that is a very difficult thing to do and so instead what happened was I got distracted talking about whatever interested me at the time and so that's what I do now I try to find the coolest demos the most amazing things around me and I show those off on the channel this is basically my first real YouTube video I really cringe to watch this if you took a piece of matter like this piece of aluminium foil you could cut it in half and in half again each time reducing the number of atoms by half but the idea was you could not go on doing that indefinitely for there would come a point when you have only a single atom left and it is uncuttable I think if you're making videos about science the easiest thing for you to do is make science for people who are already into science I mean my audience is big-time into science and I love that these people are just like me but I feel like I should also be reaching out to people who haven't had such a background in science or aren't interested in it so I want to get back to this kind of original mission at some point and maybe start another channel where I do actually do this so anyone with a very limited background in anything scientific could learn about everything in the universe thank you for watching science truly is the best thing in the world Thank You Derek for helping my creatively mind and brain understand science for over four years now so useful and many thanks for isin for helping us to sit down with his creators and explore their choices if you have a creator you're dying to get to know better let us know in the comments with the hashtag my first keep an eye out now we're bringing you wisdom from your favorite youtubers twice a week because everything is made of atoms including you and me and the Opera House and the Harbour Bridge and the water and the trees and the grass and the air","9rIy0xY99a0":"hey Vsauce Michael here and Derek generate 78 that's so random or is it what does it mean to be random can anything really be random what's the most random thing ever today let's stop being random and become brandsmart if something is unpredictable and contains no recognizable patterns we call it random so let's begin our hunt for the most random thing with a coin toss the Australian 50 cent coin is one of the largest coins currently in circulation coin flips and rolling dice are not intrinsically random they are only random because of our ignorance if we could know every initial condition the exact forces and properties that played for a particular flip or roll we could theoretically calculate the result before it even happened and sure enough researchers have built coin flipping robots that can precisely control a flip to get the result they want 100% of the time so here is our question is there anything you couldn't predict even if you knew everything a process determined by nothing and how can you be sure there aren't any patterns in what you are looking at maybe you just haven't looked for the right pattern yet or maybe you have already seen true randomness but didn't know it because you didn't look for long enough as if protected by a sort of camouflage a random process can and will occasionally produce patterns YouTube URLs are pretty much random a unique one is made for every uploaded video but sometimes like the proverbial monkeys typing away on typewriters YouTube generates a URL that contains by chance a word the official music video for 50 Cent's inda Club contains a synonym for bottom this video was assigned hello there are some Sexy's and a sauce you want to find out if a particular word has been randomly assigned to a video yet you can search for it by using this string in Google the point is randomness is difficult to identify it is easier to be certain that something is not random than that it is but despite this elusiveness something interesting is going on right now increasingly we especially young people are calling clearly predictable things random like randomly running into your best friend at a popular restaurant or hilariously bizarre combinations of things that we call totally random because they are seemingly unrelated even though of course they were chosen not at random but in a very determined way because they are all unrelated those guys that showed up at the party last night you didn't know they weren't randos in a mathematical sense they knew about the party we're in the mood to go to a party and we're in the area pretty predictable actually this non statistical use of the word random annoys some people but it's not that far off from the original meaning of the word in the 1300s random meant running or at great speed later it would be used to describe things that had no definite purpose it wasn't until the 1800s that random took on a particular mathematical definition then in the 1970s mi t--'s Student Paper popularized the use of the word random to simply mean strange of course just because something is strange doesn't mean it has no discoverable cause why if we started calling so many predictable things random while many theories revolve around the amount of information and new people we are confronted with at an increasing rate now more than ever before perhaps it's just easier almost a bit of a relief to call things random so that we can move on to synthesize other information take a look at this dye now as you can see it rolls a five most of the time but not all the time over time a sequence of its results will contain less randomness but it is still random any face is possible and I have no guarantee beforehand of knowing which face will show up the outcomes I'm selecting from make the resulting sequence less full of randomness but the process is still random even though a dye and a coin are extremely sensitive to their initial conditions and over the course of normal use are quite unpredictable they do over time exhibit certain biases biases that make them a bit more predictable and a little less random than you might think first of all dice even precision dice are only quality controlled within a few micrometers you can check this out yourself make two stacks of ten or more similar dice now if you orient each die every which way you should pretty much get two equally sized stacks but if you arrange each stack along a shared axis so that every die faces the same way any regular imperfections caused by the manufacturing process may become visible but what about coins well some fantastic research has been done on what happens when they spin and flip for instance it has been found that the u.s. nickel is just the right diameter and thickness to wind up landing not heads up or tails up when flipped but on its side about once every six thousand times its flipped but what about the fairness of flipping well if you flip a coin like this for statistical and physical reasons the side facing up before the flip begins doesn't actually have a 50% chance of being the result instead as researchers at Stanford have found it actually has a 51% chance in this case it was the other side though still pretty Randi if you want a coin flip to be as spare as possible you should just catch it in your hand don't allow it to hit the ground bounce tumble and spin that's because researchers have found that when a coin spins larger biases come into play the shape of its edge its center of gravity the heavier side tends to go down quite often in the case of some coins as often as 80% of the time it's been found that a 1 euro coin will spin and land heads up more often than not and a US penny will land tails up more often than not wins fun but like I said earlier theoretically if we knew everything about the initial conditions of a coin flip or a die roll we could calculate beforehand their outcome why don't we do that more often well it's extremely difficult insane amounts of precision would be required because the smallest difference between two initial conditions can be magnified over time leading to chaotic extremely difficult to predict results random.org the service Derek and I used at the beginning of this video to generate a random number uses atmospheric noise it's extremely hard to predict but technically still a deterministic system all that noise came from somewhere and if we could just find out those initial conditions we could theoretically predict their outcomes if we want a system more random than that we will need to find one that is determined by nothing and for that let's look closer quantumly close quantum mechanics may have our answer it describes the properties of quantum Lee sighs things as probabilities just chances not because we don't know enough yet to be certain or predict but because but the idea is there's nothing there to predict there is no beforehand we could know whether or not a particular individual radioactive atom will decay or not or whatever the spin of an electron is is only knowable once we look there determined by a deep-seated randomness woven into the universe itself Einstein couldn't believe this he refused to accept as he said that God played dice with the universe but experiments with entangled particles have shown violations of Bell inequalities entangled particles are particles that exhibit similar properties even when separated by large distances now if they agree on those shared properties to have or are somehow determined beforehand to have them their behaviors should satisfy Bell's famous inequalities but experiments have found that instead the likelihood of what a machine will see when measuring one particle determines how the other machine will measure the other particle it is here when we look that the chance is determined explanations for this are even weirder but what the results suggest is that the chance of seeing particular quantum qualities don't pre exist they happen when you look so if you are ever feeling boring or predictable just remember that you are made out of octillion of quantum probabilities dice that don't tumble in any analyzable way we could ever they are the most random thing God may play dice with the universe but they are the best dice in the universe and as always thanks for watching [Music] but what does it all mean well true randomness doesn't mean anything I mean for us to have meaning we need structure predictability and that is what I'm exploring over on my channel veritasium Wow okay so let's go over there and take a look at what is not random veritasium let's go I'll see you guys over there it's gonna be awesome come with us and as always thanks for watching [Music]","_Oc9tKkH7WE":"hey Vsauce Michael here what's wrong are you normal well today let's bathe our brains with those questions and scrub down the things that are surprising and counterintuitive what does it mean to be normal in the first place well maybe it just means to be average but an average can be a bit weird a bit misleading for instance think of it this way the average human has one breast and one testicle also the average person has not climbed to the top of Ganga insa in fact no one has gang carpo insa is considered the tallest mountain on earth that has yet to be summited and it's unlikely it ever will be soon it lies on the border of China and Bhutan and local governments believe the area to be holy and no mountaineering or climbing is allowed but don't worry there are plenty more there are at least a hundred other recognised Peaks that are quite tall and remain unsummon 'add that's great it's surprising to think that earth has so many places that still have yet to be conquered or explored at least we were all born here on earth Derek from the YouTube channel veritasium where were you born small Australian town called tur alga but were you really born there [Music] I'm suspicious of Derek's answer because saying that you were born on Earth's surface is like saying you were born in a taxi cab the taxi cab may still be around but is it in the exact same location that it was at the moment of your birth probably not like a taxi cab the earth is moving and it's moving quickly for one the earth is spinning this is real-time footage of Earth's spinning you don't notice much movement at all but that's just because earth is so large to a distant observer beyond Earth two seconds from now you will be an entire kilometer east from where you are now Earth is also orbiting around the Sun quickly three days ago I was in Singapore from the reference frame of Earth's surface Singapore is six thousand kilometers away from this place Sydney Australia but in terms of Earth orbiting around the Sun three days ago I wasn't - just six thousand kilometres away I was more than seven million point is where you were born when you were born is now just an empty region of space earth will never ever return to my favourite surprise is the solution to the three prisoners problem it's related to the Monty Hall problem of the stakes are higher if solution is notoriously counterintuitive say that myself Kevin and Jake have been arrested and we are told that tomorrow morning two of us will be executed we don't know which two so it's a terrible night but if I ask a guard to tell me something about what happens tomorrow and the guard says Michael I won't tell you anything about your fate and I won't tell you who lives but I will tell you this little piece of information tomorrow morning Jake is one of the guys who will be executed oh what a relief I used to have a 1 in 3 chance of being the one who lives but now that I know Jake dies it's just between Kevin and I my chances of living have gone up from one in three two one and two is this great well if I thought that I would actually be wrong in fact my chances of living haven't changed at all and Kevin's are paradoxically now twice as good as mine how can that be we'll take a look at this this circle represents the three possibilities either tomorrow Jake will live Kevin will live or I will live the hearts represent life isn't that beautiful now let's focus on what the guard can tell me in the case that Jake is the one who has been selected to live both Kevin and myself will die tomorrow but the guard cannot tell me anything about myself and he cannot tell me who lives so if Jake is the one chosen to survive all the guard can tell me is that Kevin will be one of the guys who dies tomorrow that's it now in this case where Kevin is the guy selected to live both myself and Jake will die tomorrow but the guard can't tell me about myself and cannot tell me who lives so all the guard can say is that tomorrow Jake is one of the guys who will die here's where it gets interesting if I am the one who has been picked to live tomorrow the guard has a choice he can either tell me that Kevin is the one who will die tomorrow or he can tell me that Jake is one of the guys who will die tomorrow well look at what we've got here if the guard tells me that Jake is one of the guys who will die tomorrow I am only faced now with these possibilities in one-third of these cases I am the survivor and in 2\/3 of these cases Kevin is the survivor my chances haven't changed and Kevin's are now twice as good as mine used to be [Music] it is a beautiful day here in Sydney before I arrived in Australia I was in Singapore where it was also beautiful but incredibly humid the air felt thick to move through and breathe but in actuality humid air is less dense than dry air Derek tell us about Avogadro's law well a begad robe came up with the idea that in a given volume of gas at a given temperature and pressure there will be always the same number of gas particles doesn't matter what the gas is if it's helium or nitrogen or oxygen and that holds true for air which is a mixture of gases that's right so it's got nitrogen and oxygen principally but if it's humid air then you replace some of those nitrogens and oxygens with water and water is lighter than the diatomic nitrogen and oxygen that exists in our atmosphere right oxygen and nitrogen have masses of 32 and 28 whereas water is just 18 humid air is actually much less dense than dry air it's lighter and things can move through it more easily this is especially true when it comes to baseballs a baseball travels through humid air more easily and further with the same amount of energy if air becomes more humid and decreases drag by only five percent that can mean the difference between a fly ball and a homerun this became a problem when indoor baseball stadiums started to play around with the idea of turning on the air conditioning when the rival team came up to bat essentially the air conditioning made the air dryer therefore thicker and made the rival team hit baseballs shorter distances the word normal by the way is home illogical what does that mean a home illogical adjective describes itself for instance the word tiny is pretty tiny it's small word the word unhyphenated is unhyphenated normal is one of the top 1000 most commonly spoken and written words the word normal is normal it describes itself but there are also words that are heterological adjectives that don't describe themselves for instance the word misspelled with yes well if you don't misspell it if you don't misspell it what about abbreviated ooh I like that one too what about German German not a German word that is a good that's a good one how about mono syllabic that's heterological because it doesn't describe itself but polysyllabic for sure I especially love just how home illogical Pinta syllabic is yeah five syllables what is genius yeah well it's the way words are the way they normally are but what about you are you normal well a common way of defining normal is to say that something about you is normal if you fall within just one standard deviation of the average for all people but there are a lot of things about you you can easily think of saying 36 different independent variables different things to say about yourself for instance how tall you are how many friends you have how bad your breath is or say how often you lie now the statistical probability that you would be normal for all 36 of those different attributes is actually one in a million which means mathematically speaking it is quite abnormal to be normal and as always thanks for watching [Music]","vKA4w2O61Xo":"I'm gonna give you guys three numbers a three number sequence and I have a rule in mind that these three numbers obey and I want you to try to figure out what that rule is but the way that you can get information is by proposing your own set of three numbers to which I will say yes that follows my rule or no it doesn't follow my role and then you can propose what you think the rule is that fair yeah yeah okay so here here are the three numbers 2 4 8 2 4 8 you don't need to continue the sequence you can propose a totally different sequence whatever you want to propose and I will simply say yes or no definitely 4 8 16 32 16 32 and 64 there's also follow my rule ok what's the rule we multiply by 2 that is not my rule right that's not my rule but you're allowed if you want propose three other numbers 3 6 12 3 6 8 12 3 6 12 follows my rule 10 20 40 10 20 40 that follows the rule there are some multiplying by 2 and yes it follows my rule but no it's not my rule 5 10 10 and 20 follows my rule 100 200 400 follows my rule 500 a thousand two thousand follows my role I'm gonna keep lying that's right just keep going you're totally fine but you're approaching it the way most people approach it like think strategically about this you want information yeah I have information the point of the three numbers right is to allow you to figure out what the rule is yeah okay I'm gonna give you the numbers that I don't think fits the sequence and see what you say so I'll say 2 4 7 fits my rule so whatever I propose is right so is your rule like you can propose any number so the rule is anything we say is yes no but you are on the right track now hit me with three numbers three six nine follows my rule oh that didn't follow my rule this is good right five ten fifteen that follows my rule what oh really yeah I don't believe this one two three one two three follow the rule what about seven eight nine follow me yes that follows the rule eight 1639 fits the role excellent but where you're no closer to the rule I want you to get to the rule about one seven thirteen follows the rule eleven twelve thirteen I don't know how to do this does not follow the rule ten nine eight does not oh so is it all in ascending order oh yeah okay up top yes first to get it you guys nailed it that's the rule that's the rule increasing numbers in increasing order Oh one two three four five six ten fifteen twenty five doesn't matter any numbers in ascending order I was inspired to make this video by the book the Black Swan by Nassim Taleb now the Black Swan is a metaphor for the unknown and the unexpected I mean in the old world the theory was that all swans were white so each instance of a white swan would make you think yeah that theory is pretty good but the point is you can never prove a theory true and in fact when people found Australia they realized that there were black swans what was interesting for me was that everyone I spoke to came up with a rule very early on and then only proposed numbers that fit with that rule they were thinking I was looking for you guys to propose a set of numbers that didn't follow your rule and didn't follow my rule I was looking for you guys not to try to confirm what you believe you're always asking something where you expect the answer to be yes right like you're trying to get at it yeah but instead you want to get it the know you want to get the know because that's much more informational for you than the yes like if everything's doing against you say that that is what's so important about the scientific method we set out to disprove our theories and it's when we can't disprove them that we say this must be getting at something really true about reality so I think we should do that in all aspects of our lives if you think that something is true you should try as hard as you can to disprove it only then can you really get at the truth and not fool yourself you","IlnZKSR73S0":"this is a neodymium magnet it's pretty darn strong and now after heating it in a flame it's no longer magnetic what just happened well to build a magnet all you need to do is find a bunch of magnetic atoms that's easy they're the ones with the half-filled electron shells in the middle of any of the major blocks of the periodic table and then make a compound where the magnetic fields of the atoms aligned in the same direction this is ferromagnetism named after iron which is pretty darn magnetic however it's not always so easy sometimes the atoms actually want to align their magnetic fields in alternating directions this is called anti ferromagnetism and it means the bulk material won't have a magnetic field at all or sometimes the tendency of the atomic magnets to align or anti-aligned is just too weak to overcome their intrinsic jiggling that is their temperature in which case even though all the individual atoms in the material are magnetic the material as a whole again isn't however in a strong external magnetic field the atoms do tend to align with each other in the direction parallel to the field this is called para magnetism and liquid oxygen is a great example it's attracted by a magnet though it doesn't stay magnetized afterwards but let's get back to the question how do you destroy a magnet well a material can only be ferromagnetic if it's temperature is low enough above a certain point the nicely ordered atomic magnetic fields melt into disorder just as ice crystals melt into water when heated past zero Celsius so to destroy a magnet you just need to heat it up past its magnetic melting point called the Curie temperature it probably won't look like much is happening but once the atoms are jiggling around enough their magnetic fields will no longer all point in the same direction magnet destroyed and just as different elements melt from solid to liquid at different temperatures they also melt from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic at different temperatures which you can explore in

take a piece of wood and put it next to another piece of wood nothing happens and if you take a piece of granite and put it next to another Rock still nothing but if you take this piece of iron and put it next to this other piece of iron magic I mean magnet magnetic objects are able to magically attract at long distances because they generate magnetic fields that extend invisibly out beyond the object but the mystery is this where do magnetic fields come from well that's easy Henry we've known for a long time that electricity and magnetism are really just two sides of the same coin kind of like mass and energy or time and space they can be transformed into one another and in fact a magnetic field is just what an electric field becomes when an electrically charged object starts moving that makes sense for explaining why a current of electrons flowing through a wire causes this compass needle to move or how currents in the Earth's outer core generate the geomagnetic field but a bar magnet or the compass needle itself are just pieces of metal without any electrical current running through them or are they at the microscopic level there are loads of electrons whizzing around the atoms and molecules that make up any solid right this brings up an excellent point the magnetic behavior of any everyday object is influenced by a fascinating combination of effects ranging from the level of particles to atoms collections of atoms and collections of collections of atoms first individual particles unlike the everyday workings of gravity and electricity permanent magnets can only be fully understood as a quantum mechanical effect in much the same way that particles like electrons and quarks have fundamental properties called mass and electrical charge most particles also have another intrinsic property called a tiny magnet just kidding it's called intrinsic magnetic moment but really that's just technical mumbo-jumbo saying that particles with electric charge also happen to be tiny magnets if you want to know why they're tiny magnets well you may as well ask why are particles charged in the first place or why do objects with mass and energy attract each other gravitationally no one knows we just know that's the way the universe works exactly and since the 1920s we've known that each individual electron or proton is basically a tiny magnet which brings us to the level of atoms an atom is a bunch of positively charged protons with a bunch of negatively charged electrons whizzing around them the proton tiny magnets are about a thousand times weaker than the electron ones so the nucleus of the atom has almost no effect on the magnetism of the atom as a whole and you might think that since many though not all of the electrons are also moving that like the current in a wire they should generate magnetic fields due to that motion and indeed they do these are called orbital magnetic fields except these don't usually contribute to the magnetic field of an atom here's why electrons and atoms are accurately and complicatedly described by quantum mechanics but the gist of the story is that electrons congregate in shells around the nucleus the electrons in any filled shell zoom equally in all directions so the currents they generate cancel out and generate no magnetic field these electrons also come in pairs whose tiny magnets point in opposite directions and also cancel however in a half-filled shell all of the electrons are unpaired and their tiny magnets point in the same direction and add up meaning that it's the intrinsic magnetism of the electrons in the outer shell that gives an atom the majority of its magnetic field so atoms near the side of any of the major blocks of the periodic table which have full or nearly full outer electron shells aren't magnetic and atoms in the middle of the blocks have half full outer electron shells and are magnetic for example nickel cobalt iron manganese chromium etc wait but chromium isn't magnetic ah but just because an atom is magnetic doesn't mean that a material made up of lots of that atom will be magnetic which brings us to the level of crystals when a bunch of magnetic atoms get together to make a solid they generally have two options one is for all the atoms to align their magnetic fields with each other or they can align their magnetic fields in an alternating fashion so they all cancel out the atoms will do whichever one requires less energy that's why chromium for example is a very magnetic atom but a very unmagnetized because it's one of the most anti ferromagnetic materials that we know iron on the other hand is the namesake of ferromagnetism so it is unsurprisingly ferromagnetic or in usual parlance magnetic sometimes the last and final level of magnetism is that of domain essentially even in a magnetic material where the magnetic fields of atoms line up together it's possible that one chunk of the material will have all its atoms lined up pointing one way and another chunk will have all its atoms pointing another way and so on if all of these domains are of a similar size then none may be strong enough to force the others to align with it in which case a piece of iron for example may have no magnetic field at all because of all the warring magnetic kingdoms within it however if you apply a strong enough magnetic field from outside the material you can help one domain expand its control over its neighbors and so on until all of the domains have been unified into one Kingdom all pointing in the same direction and now finally you can rule with an iron fist I mean magnet its magnetic because it's ferromagnetic and all of the domains are aligned exactly what's remarkable is that magnetism is a fundamentally quantum property amplified to the size of everyday objects every permanent magnet is a reminder that quantum mechanics underlies our universe in order for an everyday object to be magnetic though it has to have a unified Kingdom of magnetic domains each made up of bajillions of magnetic atoms which also need to be aligned with each other each of which can only be magnetic in the first place if it has an approximately half filled outer shell of electrons so their intrinsic magnetic fields can align and not cancel each other out not surprisingly these criteria are pretty difficult to fulfill which is why there are only a limited number of suitable materials you can use when you're building a magnet or you could just run a current through any electrical conductor and produce a magnetic field that way but hey why does that work in the first place click here to go over to veritasium and we'll find out what special relativity and the speed of light have to do with electromagnets I want to find out [Music] you","yXT012us9ng":"the temperature of regular stuff is basically just a measurement of the jig leanness of the atoms and molecules that make that stuff up more jiggling higher temperature

metal and a book that have been sitting in your fridge the metal will feel much colder than the book derrick of veritasium did a great video on this but you really have to try it for yourself to believe it the metal and the book are honestly at the same temperature as measured by a thermometer but the metal feels colder this isn't just a trick of the mind though we experience the metal as colder than the book for a very physical reason metal is a conductor and paper is an insulator so the energy or jiggly Ness of the molecules in our hands is absorbed more quickly by the metal than by the book even though the book and the metal are at the same temperature the metal causes the temperature of our hands to go down faster and thus we experience the metal as being colder because the temperature of our hands is what we really feel it's like how technically a mercury thermometer really only measures its own temperature then you can only indirectly measure temperatures of other things by putting them in thermal contact with it similarly the thermo receptive nerves in our skin can only directly measure the temperature of the skin itself and not of anything else so when we touch something we don't feel its temperature but rather we feel its effect on our skin that is how much and how quickly it transfers thermal energy that's the jiggling of molecules to or from us the capacity to transfer thermal energy is also why a blast of steam from your stovetop can feel so much hotter than a blast of hot dry air from your oven even if the oven has a higher temperature water vapor transfers more molecular jiggling to your skin than air by itself in fact it's tempting to say that hot and cold are fundamentally different concepts from high temperature and low temperature even though we usually use the words interchangeably hot really means it gives off a lot of energy while high temperature means it has a lot of energy and as anyone who's tried fund-raising knows just

the best thermal conductor and is good at conducting electricity is copper I know it sounds hopeless but luckily you know something about nanotechnology you know really really tiny devices and materials that are less than a hundred nanometers in size of course I don't have to tell you a nanometer is a billionth of a meter that's roughly the size of ten atoms but how do you create something that tiny it's time to embrace your inner MacGyver you're gonna need a pencil some scotch tape and a healthy dose of elbow grease a pencil contains not lead but graphite which consists of sheets of carbon in hexagonal lattice when you write layers of graphite slide off the tip of the pencil and stick to the paper usually many layers are stacked on top of each other but once in a while you get a single layer of carbon atoms and this is called graphene in 2004 andre game and konstantin novoselov created graphene using nothing but graphite and scotch tape they placed a graphite flake onto the tape folded it in two and then cleaved the flake in half they repeated this procedure a number of times and then studied the resulting fragments to their astonishment they found some of the pieces were only a single atom thick this was particularly unexpected because it was thought a single layer of graphite would not be chemically stable especially at room temperature graphene conducts electrons faster than any other substance at room temperature this is because of the extraordinarily high quality of the graphene lattice scientists are yet to find a single atom out of place in graphene since the electrons aren't scattered by defects in the lattice they go so fast that Einstein's relativity must be used to understand their motion and this perfect lattice is created by the very strong yet flexible bonds between carbon atoms making the substance bendable but harder than diamond graphene is incredibly strong if you could balance an elephant on a pencil and support the pencil on graphene the graphene wouldn't break of course the pencil would for their discovery game and Novus Elif were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 and this is only the beginning for graphene scientists are hard at work exploiting its unique properties to create thin transparent flexible touchscreens smaller faster more energy efficient computers tough composite materials and more efficient solar cells and now consider this is only one aspect of nanotechnology so in order to think big you need first consider the very small","myh94hpFmJY":"[Applause] why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on earth i mean take australia for example depending on who you ask it has all or nearly all of the 10 most venomous snakes in the world plus the funnel web spider the blue ringed octopus box jellyfish paralysis tick and stone fish all found in australia are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur which in the mail secretes a venom that can kill a dog in humans it would merely cause excruciating pain this question why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places is one that i've wondered about for most of my life perhaps it's because i was born here in the small town of taraugon australia this is the first house where i ever lived as my mom recalls in the backyard there was a shed where we found red bucks and i used to play in the show i don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there yeah that's very comforting thanks mom now if you don't know what a red back is it's a very poisonous spider hold up i gotta tell past derek something you see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful continue so thankfully they never bit me otherwise i wouldn't be standing here today now before we go any further it's probably worth asking is it true do more venomous species really live in hot places well apparently i'm not the only one who thinks so because i found this reddit thread on the topic though it really didn't explain why that was the case but what about the data well here is a map of the global average temperatures compare that with this map that i've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country the country with the most venomous species is mexico with 80 different organisms with the power to kill you that's followed closely by brazil and then australia well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures so why is it so my first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules so i ran that idea past professor polyakov of periodic videos no i don't think so all right because the reason is that if you go up a 10 degree centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and i don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rate so maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly well in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it has evolved from saliva in the funnel web spider for example the lethal effect seems quite accidental what you've got to understand about the venom it's there it's a secondary thing that it actually kills the actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey except they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and once it's turned to liquid all spiders live on soup the funnel web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet ironically its venom is most potent for exactly this group biggest evolutionary joke ever the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates we don't have primates in australia all right so it's lemurs monkeys apes and us most species deliver not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues but since we're talking about cocktails what would happen if you drank some venom you could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or in stomach ulcer or things like this it's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem okay so since drinking the venom is not going to kill you what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan that's the world's most venomous land snake what you do don't panic stay calm i think that would be easier said than done the venom travels through the lymphatic system so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels so that's just quite close under the skin and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing and so what actually kills you is suffocation so what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb now once you've got it bandaged up you need to find some anti-venom what is anti-venom well it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom the horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten making anti-venom is tough work it would take 70 milkings of a funnel web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective so you might wonder well why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom that would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you but why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates well i went to the experts to find out about this trend you know broadly yeah there's really not much of a pattern happening really what about that reddit thread and the map i made if you're saying is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places i don't know if there is in snakes which is the group that i'm most familiar with in australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one if you wander around southern australia every snake you find on mount kosciuszko is venomous if you wander around the tropics of darwin you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake they're all pythons and harmless collubrid snakes now this is unexpected the most venomous snakes in australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is 20 million years ago uh an itinerant sea snake coming down from asia as australia drifted up to asia got to australia it was venomous to start with there were no snakes in australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through australia this big family called the alapati the cobra family okay but on a global scale my point remains there are more venomous species in hot countries there's going to be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area the problem is that there's vastly more snakes so as a proportion of the snakes that are there the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the in the case of a place like australia than they would be in a cold area so why are there more venomous species in warm places well the truth is there aren't at least not as a proportion of species the majority of venomous species on earth are ectotherms those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom there is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species but that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places the only snakes that get into the arctic circle are european vipers a venomous species but biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question it also depends on evolutionary history if you'd come to australia 20 million years ago there would have been no snakes at all the venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after i think it's a really lousy explanation but it's the best one that we've got why is that a lousy explanation oh well it doesn't invoke any lovely complicated piece of uh ecological theory or anything else it's just relying on history but this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for jamaica these are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had so it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders i am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time roughly 15 000 years after the last ice age now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the northern latitudes of the northern hemisphere for example in ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet my point is the distribution of species depends on what happened it may be an unsatisfying explanation but i'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there so what do you think is going to happen to the spot on the screen as i narrow the color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales you see as i started to go through this big investigation i realized just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there for example why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is pretty weak and i didn't end up with anything the deadly guys turn out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be an historical accident another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom the big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones they've actually evolved from venomous snakes venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes the successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva so it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species if you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below","vqDbMEdLiCs":"when you touch an object and it feels warm or cold what is that really telling you about the object here I have a metal hard drive and a book and I'm gonna ask people to compare their temperatures which one do you think will feel warmer the book or the hard drive the 10 pitches yeah tell me if one is hotter or colder or if they're the same temperature how do they feel this is slightly cooler than this one yeah that's cool man yeah my yeah I agree outside the hard drive is a lot colder than the book um I don't know cuz the books got more knowledge why do you think that is metals normally a little bit chillier if you leave it in a colder temperature well what if I said that there brother the same temperature what would you say so you're buying but really you think you're lying yeah oh Jesus well maybe the way I could prove it is I have infrared thermometer what do you think we're gonna see let's think sign smart the other name for that and I'm not a scientist I like a prediction for me I still think that that that's cold would you get me money I do it because I don't have any cash let's measure the temperature of the book okay what do you see 19 5 0 K I measure the temperature of that 19.0 I will now I believe I'm trying to get you figure it out actually try to figure out why there would be the same temperature that I didn't feel the same temperature that so why does that feel colder if they're basically the same good one you're the answer ha ha I'm coming to you guys Francis we're creatives not intellectuals for create an answer for me I'm sorry I just go on you tell me well I'll try to answer that question with another little experiment here is an aluminium block and nice and close a plastic block how do they temperatures compare completely different well lately much photo yeah yeah this actually feels colder let's take this to the next level I'm gonna put an ice cube on both plates what are we gonna sing well I'm guessing it would stay solid on this one and melt on this one so it's going to melt on the plastic but stay solid on the alamin you yes and maybe I'm wrong that one will melt more quickly than on the aluminium block yes see sitting in the cold oh yeah cause it's cold let's actually make it a guy design alright so we put an ice cube on each of those blocks wha what are you seeing well it is melting a lot quicker on the aluminium I got his melting given then not one even notices aluminium that's custody so which one felt colder that one how does that make any sense I have no idea aluminium be bad for the environment how would aluminium be bad for the environment well it's storing at the ocelot quickly reason so you want the answer yes please it's about thermal conductivity right the rate at which heat is transferred from one object to another so when you felt these blocks originally I know this one felt a lot colder yeah but you know from the other example we did that they must both be at the same temperature truth is they both been outside for a while we see that the aluminium block is melting the ice faster than the plastic block because it's conducting the heat to the Ice Cube faster okay with the plastic block it's a worse thermal conductor so heat is being transferred less quickly to this ice block and so it's staying ice okay I believe you mmm-hmm make sense yes you know in our first example the hard drive felt colder even though it was at the same temperature roughly as the book and that's because the aluminium conducts heat away from your hand faster than the book conducts heat away from your hand sure that seems logical which makes the the hard drive feel colder and the book feel warmer yes so when you touch something you don't actually feel temperature you feel the rate at which heat is conducted either towards or away from you think about this next time you hop out of the shower in winter it's much nicer to stand on the bath mat than on the tile beside it not because the bath mat is warmer but because it conducts heat less quickly away from you","2KZb2_vcNTg":"trees are some of the biggest organisms on the planet but where do they get that matter to grow which nutrients ate the ground stats or any goodness out of the soil us please comes out of a soil yeah goodness goodness why isn't there a big hole around the tree where it's taken out all the soil does it's a gradually let the soil has time to recover now I think it's intuitive to believe that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots digging into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean a tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not in the early 1600s a scientist named Johan Baptista van Helmholtz tried to figure out where the mass of a tree was coming from so he got a pot of soil and very carefully measured the amount of soil in there then he planted the tree and took care of it for five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot and at the end of this experiment he laid the tree to find that it was 72 kilograms but the mass of soil had only decreased by about 60 grams this was pretty strong evidence that the mass of the tree does not come from the soil I've never thought about that actually because they don't really eat anything crazy they don't eat me no no they don't eat anything more so it's always absorb that's all they eat yeah they don't eat anything else no that's all they eat well presumably from the water and the nutrients from the soil is there anything else that you need besides the soil in the water especially late isn't it to make a lot of other than the original seed for that particular trailer the seed in the soil and the water and that makes this big tree of course Johan Baptista van Helmholtz did conclude that the tree was made entirely of water now while that's not correct at least he was on the right track realizing that the matter of a tree doesn't come out of the soil the Sun energy yeah the Sun energy yeah are they converting energy into mass or do you know what I mean yeah like that there wasn't there wasn't stuff and then there was like where did that stuff come from magic my question is where do they get that mass to grow big Sun you from the rain and the Sun presumably like a sunlight and the sunshine the sunshine does it does the sunshine add mass to the trip um well it yes it wouldn't they wouldn't grow without it I don't know what it adds mass but they wouldn't grow without it of course the sun's energy is needed for the tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself the energy is not matter well I suppose a good for air into this as well if yeah that's got to do something at a yet you know what is it barrier I guess in the air that it needs as well oxygen the trees near the arc severely they often go by and I guess oxygen the oxygen of course the oxygen are there any ingredients that we're missing um-hum dockside carbon dioxide carbon dioxide so would it surprise you to find out that 95 percent of a tree is actually coming up from carbon dioxide trees and largely made up of air yeah let's pause it yeah yeah honey I need this reaction like oh so as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air out of the carbon dioxide that they take in what's interesting is that we breathe out carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances that trees breathe in to gain mass so if you can imagine a closed system where it was just you and a tree you would breathe out that carbon dioxide and water the tree would take it in so you would get smaller while the tree is getting bigger and in a sense you're becoming the tree Shh","Ux33-5k8cjg":"it's another beautiful day in Sydney I'm out enjoying the Sun and looking to find out if anyone knows why the Sun shines so the Sun gives us a lot of hate sunshine the divides energy yeah he doesn't like really where does the Sun get that energy from I no idea I have no idea some kind of chemical reaction yeah gas explosions doesn't it burn gas the burning of gases it's burning up for the fire that's on the Sun but is the Sun really a giant ball of fire I mean wouldn't it go out after five billion years one of those things that you just assume you know but then you don't actually know so in this bucket I have the components of the Sun well I have protons and neutrons there are some electrons but I didn't bring them okay most the Sun is actually protons okay and so what are the protons doing the Sun it dance together okay okay when they come close you know what they do they just flat well actually they bounce off each other I'm coming in oh why did the protons bounce off each other sometimes with electrons how's new native oh yeah cuz it don't like each other they don't like each other that's because a proton needs a neutron right you know why they they repel like that magnetic force the repelling magnet type thing Megan silver electric field positive and negative positive and negative it's to do with the positive negative right we got protons protons are the positively charged yes the positive you're probably good okay this is why it's so important that the sun's hot because if the Sun is hot enough it gets these things moving so fast that sometimes they can't avoid a collision okay when they get too close they actually go smash the brothers yeah yeah yeah no no dispatch oh and now they're stuck together and you saw what happened when they smashed together what happened they leaked is that synergy yeah see well the water pulled out but I guess energy would have poured out it the energy in the channel the energy came out what was the energy before it was energy kinetic thought energy so what's happening there it's releasing some mass yeah yeah waiting and that mass is is kinetic energy it was the mass of the proton proton smashed together they got lighter yeah and they lost that mass and the mass was converted to energy you know famous equation about that it's good it's good yeah e equals MC squared forget ends to do have you heard that famous equation which person person makes energy Wow equals MC squared yes so what see the Sun matters energy emi's mass see Cassidy carbon I don't remember what's he means sir C is the speed of light speed of light no right Billy yeah huh isn't that weird the speed of light right huh well now why do we have sides it seems most people have a tough time remembering that C is for the speed of light maybe that's because C is a bit of a strange letter to represent a speed in fact an Einstein's original paper he used the letter V for velocity of light but nowadays everyone uses the letter C for constant it's a constant of the universe the speed of light though some people claim the letter C stands for celeritas the Latin word for swiftness what is that equation telling us about energy and mass energy equals constant mass the mass and the energy combined together creates the energy he's basically saying like this mass that comes out gets converted to a lot of energy and the speed of light is a huge number yeah you think about that tiny bit of mass is a huge amount of energy so every second the Sun is actually losing 4.3 billion kilograms every second that amount of mass is being converted into energy in the Sun hydrogen fuses together to form helium but that's a little confusing because how out of only protons do we create a helium nucleus which has two protons and two neutrons well the thing is when the first two smashed together one of the protons actually emits a positron and a neutrino it quickly becomes a neutron next thing that happens is another proton smashes in and again we get more energy released now if two particles like this collide they emit two protons and what we're left with is the helium four nucleus there you have hydrogen fused into helium and a lot of mass lost a lot of energy released yes if you want to know more about fusion in the Sun check out this video by minutephysics it explains how the protons confuse even though they're not really going fast enough to overcome their repulsion hot enough for fusion will fuse together anyway and the Sun is so big and has so much hydrogen that these small chances happen all the time","Bz9D6xba9Og":"this is representing the earth okay and this represents what do you think yes now our first challenge is how far apart are they like roughly roughly okay oh I guess maybe about that far maybe about that much yeah yeah yeah maybe roughly like roughly maybe I like that okay yeah yeah maybe that I have a good like this far my feeling is like here somewhere rough right there all right all right let's let's say here okay tonight yeah yeah good see them with pencils right here okay these are some images I found on a Google image search for the earth and the moon diagrams that are not the scale are pretty common and I understand why we make them so you can show the detail without showing all that uninteresting space in between but they can have a problematic effect on learning because they give people the wrong idea about the relative proximity of things now if we want to talk about the distance between the Earth and the moon it's actually it's about here think about this it takes light one second to go from the earth to the moon takes eight minutes for light to travel to the Sun and four years to go to our nearest star and then consider that there are a hundred billion stars in our galaxy and as far as we know a hundred billion galaxies in the universe so the universe truly is bigger than we can imagine and certainly bigger than we can draw it to scale","cU2dZz18P0c":"how long does it take for the earth to go around the Sun well a day yeah 24 hours we reckon cuz 24 hours obviously a day is a day okay I know it takes and 19 minutes where the space station took around the earth nice come on day that one day I don't know what is it I said one year Oh like a year uh yeah one year 1212 us 365 365 365 365 365 days yeah degrees is somewhere between that is not quite precise is it 365 and a bit days nearly 300 and it's 365 and a quarter dies oh the others and take one day to get around the Sun takes over year","8bTdMmNZm2M":"there are a lot of misconceptions out there and this is a video about one of the most common ones so I went around asking people what makes the moon go around the earth and they told me the earth puts a gravitational force on the moon but does the moon put a gravitational pull on the earth pull on the earth yes it does hence we have tides etc the moon falls on the earth too it affects like the tides and women and yes it does very powerful ok does the moon pull on the earth probably that as well yeah so what I want to know is how does that force that the moon exerts on the earth how does that compare in terms of size to the force the earth exerts on the moon Wow no scientist but I think that one would be more powerful than that one it's got a greater force coming from the earth because it's great a mass is the earth has more mass cuz it's a bigger mess I thought greater mass is more equals more force guys the moon pull on the earth yes but a lot less yeah not as much as the earth pulls on the moon yeah yeah but a little bit not very strongly yes but much much much much smaller because if it's mass less not size because it's smaller it's much smaller than that than the earth because it's smaller this is small allow me to let you in on a little secret everyone got it wrong the force that attracts the moon to the earth is exactly the same size as the force that attracts the earth to the moon so what's going on here why did everyone get it wrong well I think it comes down to cause and effect the effect of the force on the moon is quite clear the moon goes in circles around the earth but the effect of that force on the earth is basically negligible the earth barely wobbles at all so people interpret this negligible effect as indicating there's very little force affecting the earth but that is forgetting the third key piece of the puzzle which is inertia inertia is the tendency of mass to maintain state of motion since the earth has a greater mass it has a greater inertia and so even with the same amount of force on it it doesn't accelerate that much now the funny thing is many of the people I interviewed could state Newton's third law which is every force has not equal and opposite reaction something about Newton's law doesn't seem to fit into that just yet you're good at this wait which Newton's law are we talking about the whole equal and opposite force thing yeah that one so tell me what you're thinking man ah well did one would think that if you're into putting a force on me I would be putting an equal force upon it so why didn't they apply it to this problem well I think they may have memorized the words but not really believed Newton's third law in their core did they really feel it in their spleen I don't think they did so allow me to try to convince you all of you spleen included that Newton's third law really is true let's consider two objects initially they have the same mass 1 kilogram each so obviously the gravitational force of attraction must be the same on both of the objects now let's add a second kilogram to the first object the force on the second object will now be twice as great because that 1 kilogram is attracted equally to each of the kilograms in the first object but what is often forgotten is that Nooh kilogram is also attracted to the second object meaning that the total force on each object is still the same they're attracted to each other with an equal and opposite force we could add a third kilogram and we would find the same thing the force on both objects is still the same even though the object on the left has 3 times the mass of the object on the right so we can see that no matter what the mass any two objects will have the same gravitational force towards each other can you feel Newton's third law in your lene now it should settle inside you and become a part of you","vWVZ6APXM4w":"all right here is the setup I have a rifle mounted vertically and we're going to shoot a bullet into this block right into the middle of it so obviously the block is going to go flying into the air we're going to do this again and instead of firing the bullet right into the middle of the block we're going to shoot it off to one side and I want you to make a prediction will that spinning block when we hit it to one side will it go the same height as this first block will it go not as high or will it go higher okay so versus being shot in the middle when you shoot on the side is the question right yeah how high will it go in comparison it depends on if the bullet stays in the block I'm assuming it does it does stay in the block yes like you want to you they you same height I'm surely basing it on just like an instinct that I have I feel like I'm being tricked I just feel like you're trying to trick us and that it's gonna do something that we can't predict I thought maybe something is not as high so I'm gonna say hi ha ha I'll say hi but it's gonna like find if they're actually shopping so you have angular momentum we L yeah and he had translational momentum which is P yeah when you hit in the middle of the block the block doesn't really spin and also it just goes up to certain height but when you hit it on the side block it's going to be spinning Siskin have imparted some kinetic energy so there won't be as much potential energy and so the total energy the system basically has to say constant and the kinetic plus potential which would be the height it goes to will have to be constant so if it's fitting it has kinetic energy it can't go as high that's my prediction so my prediction is it will go up not as high but it'll spin more if it's hit to the side am I wrong I want you to think which do you think is the most reasonable and then click one of the annotations above all right are you ready make your prediction in three two one you","QD3hbVG1yxM":"here is the setup I have a

there's an identically sized ball but made of acrylic so it's denser than water and it's supported by a thread now I want you to make a prediction if I were to release this balance and allow it to rotate freely which way do you think it would tip towards the acrylic ball towards the ping-pong ball or would it remain perfectly balanced you can make your selection by clicking on one of the on-screen annotations or clicking a link in the description if they're both displacing the same amount like I think it won't rotate so yes it will not rotate stay balanced the ping-pong ball does have mass I'll be it not very much I would predict that this end will will sink I almost feel like this end would lift because it's lighter than but it wouldn't be pulling because it's tethered to the lever I don't know I'm thinking it would go this way I'm thinking because of the tension that's pulling this up so I guess if you're summing the forces isn't as more so then this is gonna rest no all right so just switch my mind I want to go what this one's gonna raise but I mean it seems like this shouldn't be contributing any force to this side because it's suspended and the forces are balanced that means you'd have more of a normal force on this side and it won't tip that way it'll tip down on the back on both sides both side yeah that is so weird so now you think it's gonna go up on the side hold on a sec you ready 3 2 1 member","HgCXdNhVC1Q":"at the palace of discovery in Paris they have this huge turntable where you can sit and perform experiments like in the middle of the turntable you can put some water and then add liquid nitrogen and this creates a kind of fog these tiny water droplets that spread out from the middle but because the actual linear speed of this turntable is increasing the further out you go well the vapor falls further and further behind creating a swirl that looks a little bit like a hurricane and that analogy is not by accident the earth is after all one giant turntable and the weather patterns we get are a result of that when you study physics in rotating frames of reference or even just rotating bodies you find some pretty mysterious and counterintuitive phenomena which is why I'm dedicating this video to four revolutionary riddles number one here I have a ramp or an inclined plane and just to show you I'm not doing anything funny with it if I just let a roll of tape go it will accelerate down the ramp but here I have a mystery cylinder and I'm gonna place that on the ramp and we will see that it rolls and then it stops and then it rolls and then stops so my question to you is what is in the mystery cylinder what is this object number two take a bicycle and have someone support it so it doesn't fall over or lean it up against something and then take a bit of string and tie it to the bottom pedal now what I'm gonna do is pull backwards horizontally on this string and I want you to predict what the bike will do will it go backwards forwards or will it just stay there and not move my intuition would tell me that would go forward I think it might not move if you're gonna be pulling backwards from a stationary point the petal you're gonna be pulling it backwards just as the petals are trying to spin the wheels forward so maybe it might not move I think it's gonna go forward I'll go with the forward sure yeah I'm sure all right number three I want you to think about running two laps of this track now the first lap you can go as slowly as you like let's call that speed v1 but on your second lap I want you to run faster such that the total average speed for both laps combined is twice v1 twice the speed of your first lap so the question for you is how fast you have to run that second lap so that your total average speed is 2 v1 number for any time a train is moving either slowly or very fast there is a part of the train which is actually moving backwards with respect to the ground that is not backwards with respect to the train and it doesn't have to be going so slowly that if you ran backwards you would be going backwards with respect to the ground it is at any speed any normal train will have a part of it which is moving backwards with respect to the ground my question to you is which part is it now with these four riddles you can make me a video response if you

line","72DCj3BztG4":"[Applause] this video contains the answers to my four revolutionary riddles so if you haven't seen the riddles yet you should probably watch them before you watch the answers it's okay I'll wait just click this card up here now when I filmed the riddles I also filmed the solutions at the same time but that was before I received your 15,000 comments and dozens of video responses so I'm reading parts of this solutions video to incorporate the results I saw in the comments and to use some of your video responses to help explain the solutions let's get to it okay by looking at the comments for number one over fifteen percent of you said a cylinder containing sand now this contains some powder see how it rolls it it doesn't seem to roll very far before it stops and then it won't roll again because I think the sand just kind of levels off in there maybe you were thinking a bigger kind of sand like this small gravely stones let's try that that actually rolls pretty well nearly 25% of you said a cylinder half-full of water so let's try that this rolls very well and so it's not water and nearly 45 percent of you said a cylinder half-full of a viscous liquid here I have a half-full container of honey so let's see how it rolls that's not bad it's rolling and it's it's stopping and it's rolling some more this is a pretty good guess and I think the behavior is not exactly the same as the mystery cylinder but it definitely is similar and that's no coincidence the mystery cylinder actually contains honey and ping-pong balls there are two ping-pong balls submerged in this honey so if I place that on the ramp and the center of gravity is not above the point of contact with the ramp and so it rolls forward but now because those ping-pong balls are in the front they change the center of gravity and so it's exactly under the point of contact and so it stops briefly but then as the viscosity of the honey allows those ping-pong balls to move up the center of gravity shifts forwards again allowing this little container to roll so that is the trick of the mystery cylinder pretty easy if you want to try it out at home now I challenged you to run two laps of this track where the first lap you could go as slowly as you like but the second lap you had to go much faster such that your total average speed was twice the speed of your first lap now when I was first asked this question by Simon Pam Perna it took me a long time and scribbling on paper and just something didn't seem to work out and that's because you can't actually do this it's impossible I mean you might think I could run 3v1 for my second lap and that would mean my total average speed is 2v1 the problem is you can't just add the two velocities together and divide by two because you spent much more time your first lap so that velocity is weighted more heavily into the average so you'd have to run well impossibly fast let me explain the velocity of the first lap was the distance around the track divided by t1 the time it took you now if you want your total average time to be twice v1 well then it needs to be 2d over t1 you need to run twice the distance in the same amount of time as it took you to run the first lap but you've already run that first lap and so you have no time remaining to run the second lap even if you went the speed of light you would not be able to increase your total average speed up to twice the velocity of your first lap it is just mathematically impossible so this may seem like a bit of a trick question but the point to me is how doable it sounds how it seems like something you should be able to do but you can't it's it's actually impossible riddle number four the question about the train was actually answered pretty well with most people mentioning something to do with the wheels but of course that makes sense in a series of riddles which are about rotation rotational motion some people though did point out that maybe it was the steam that was going backwards or maybe air molecules in the Train and that is actually a pretty clever point however I wouldn't really consider it the air in the Train part of the train so indeed the part of the train that is moving backwards is the flange part of the wheel which is below the rail that is the part of the train which is moving backwards to understand why you just think about a spinning wheel the top of the wheel is moving forwards at speed 2v and the bottom of the wheel is not moving forward at all it is stationary with respect to the track and that is what we call rolling without slipping and that's how most wheels work at least that's how they're designed to work now in the case of trains they have to have flanges so the train doesn't fall off its rails but of course when these pieces come around during the rotation of the wheel they actually extend beyond the rail and therefore they are going backwards with respect to the ground so the part of the train that's moving backwards is always changing but it's always that part of the flange that part that extends beyond the wheel that is below the level of the track so what happens when you pull the bottom pedal of a bike backwards well about 45% of you thought that the bike would move backwards about a quarter so that it would move forwards and a quarter said the bike wouldn't move at all and 5% said it depends on something so let's give it a shot and see what happens I'm going to pull backwards on the bike pedal in three two one whoa the bike did indeed move back and for virtually all bikes this is what you will find but the explanation is not just as simple as well the net force on the bike is back so therefore it has to accelerate backwards and to prove that that logic doesn't work we'll just have a look at this video by George Hart what's this again I pull the same pedal backward but now the bike whose forward I'll put a link to the full video here and a link to his website in the description so the reason the bike moves backwards is because of the way these gears are set up the diameter of the tire and also the distance on this crank to the pedal itself because as a bike moves forwards the pedal even when you're pushing back on it never actually moves backwards with respect to the ground it's always moving forwards so if you drag a string behind a pedal of a bike moving forward the string is always moving forward now just play that movie backward in your mind and it may be clear how pulling the string backward could make the bike move backward they move forward together so they move backward together another way to think about this is to consider the path traced out by the pedal as the bike moves forward this is called the trochoidal ordinary bikes and the pedals are moving much slower than the tires so the pedal is always going forward with respect to the ground but George modified his bike so the ratio of the pedal to the wheel radius was greater than the ratio of the front sprocket to the back sprocket and this ultra low gear changes the trochoidal does go backwards with respect to the ground as the bike goes forwards and that's why he could pull back on the pedal and make the bike go forwards this is the same reason why if you were to pull backwards on the flange of a train wheel you could actually get the train to move forwards if you pulled backwards with enough force for all normal bicycles pulling back like this on the bottom pedal will cause the bicycle to move backwards but depending on the gear ratio you can get the bike to move forwards so it was those people who said it depends on the ratio of these gears and the size of this crank to the radius of the back wheel that were actually the most correct you","IcrBqCFLHIY":"in this phone there are nearly a hundred million transistors in this computer there's over a billion the transistor is in virtually every electronic device we use TVs radios Tamagotchis but how does it work well the basic principle is actually incredibly simple it works just like this switch so it controls the flow of electric current it can be off so you could call that the zero State or it could be on the one state and this is how all of our information is now stored and processed in zeros and ones little bits of electric current but unlike this switch a transistor doesn't have any moving parts and it also doesn't require a human controller furthermore it can be switched on and off much more quickly than I can flick this switch and finally and most importantly it is incredibly tiny well this is all thanks to the miracle of semiconductors or rather I should say the science of semiconductors pure silicon is a semiconductor which means it conducts electric current better than insulators but not as well as metals this is because an atom of silicon has four electrons in its outermost or valence shell this allows it to form bonds with its four nearest neighbors hidey-ho they right so it forms a tetrahedral crystal but since all these electrons are stuck in bonds if you ever get enough energy to escape their bonds and travel through the lattice so having a small number of mobile charges is what makes silicon a semi conductor now this wouldn't be all that useful without a semiconductors secret weapon doping you've probably heard of doping it's when you inject a foreign substance in order to improve performance yeah it's actually just like that except on the atomic level there are two types of doping called n-type and p-type to make n-type semiconductor you take pure silicon and inject a small amount of an element with five valence electrons like phosphorus this is useful because phosphorous is similar enough to silicon that it can fit into the lattice but it brings with it an extra electron so this means now the semiconductor has more mobile charges and so it conducts current better in p-type doping an element with only three valence electrons is added to the lattice like boron now this creates a hole a place where there should be an electron but there isn't but this still increases the conductivity of the semiconductor because electrons can move into it now although it's the electrons that are moving we like to talk about the holes moving around because there's far fewer of them now since the hole is the lack of an electron it actually acts as a positive charge and this is why p-type semiconductor is actually called p-type the P stands for positive it's positive charges these holes which are moving and conducting the current now it's a common misconception that n-type semiconductors are negatively charged and p-type semiconductors are positively charged that's not true they are both neutral because they have the same number of electrons and protons inside them the N and the P actually just refer to the sign of charge that can move within them so in n-type it's negative electrons which can move and in p-type it's a positive hole that moves but they're both neutral a transistor is made with both n-type and p-type semiconductors a common configuration has n on the ends with P in the middle just like a switch a transistor has an electrical contact at each end and these are called the source and the drain but instead of a mechanical switch there is a third electrical contact called the gate which is insulated from the semiconductor by an oxide layer when a transistor is made the N and P types don't keep to themselves electrons actually diffuse from the n-type where there are more of them into the p-type to fill the holes this creates something called the depletion layer what's been depleted charges that can move there are no more free electrons in the n-type why because they filled the holes in the p-type now this makes the p-type negative thanks to the added electrons and this is important because the p-type will now repel any electrons that try to come across from the n-type so the depletion layer actually acts as a barrier preventing the flow of electric current through the transistor so right now the transistor is off it's like an open switch it's in the zero state to turn it on you have to apply a small positive voltage to the gate this attracts the electrons over and overcomes that repulsion from the depletion layer it actually shrinks the depletion layer so that electrons can move through and form a conducting channel so the transistor is now on it's in the one state this is remarkable because just by exploiting the properties of a crystal we've been able to create a switch that doesn't have any moving parts that can be turned on and off very quickly just with a voltage and most importantly it can be made tiny transistors today are only about 22 nanometers wide which means there are only about 50 atoms across but to keep up with Moore's law they're going to have to keep getting smaller moore's law states that every two years the number of transistors on a chip should double and there is a limit as those terminals get closer and closer together quantum effects become important and electrons can actually tunnel from one side to the other so you may not be able to make a barrier high enough to stop them from blowing now this will be a real problem for the future of transistors but we'll probably only face that another 10 years down the track so until then transistors the way we know them are going to keep getting better we want to have let's say 300 of those qubits then you have like 2 to the 300 classical things which is as many particles as there are in universe","g_IaVepNDT4":"a classical computer performs operations using classical bits which can be either 0 or 1 now in contrast a quantum computer uses quantum bits or qubits and they can be both 0 and 1 at the same time and it is this that gives a quantum computer it's superior computing power there are a number of physical objects that can be used as a qubit a single photon a nucleus or an electron I met up with researchers who are using the outermost electron in phosphorus as a qubit but how does that work well all electrons have magnetic fields so they're basically like tiny bar magnets and this property is called spin if you place them in a magnetic field they will align with that field just like a compass needle lines up with the magnetic field of the earth now this is the lowest energy State so you can call it the zero State or we call it for the electron spin down now you can put it in a one state or spin up but that takes some energy if you took out the glass from your compass you could turn the needle the other way but you would have to apply some force to it you have to push it to flip to the other side and that is the highest energy state in principle if you were so delicate to really put it exactly against the magnetic field it would stay there now so far this is basically just like a classical bit it's got two states spin up and spin down would you like the classical one and zero but the funny thing about quantum objects is that they can be in both states at once now when you measure the spin it will be either up or down but before you measure it the electron can exist in what's called a quantum superposition where these coefficients indicate the relative probability of finding the electron in one state or the other now it's hard to imagine how this enables the incredible computing power of quantum computers without considering two interacting quantum bits hello hi now there are four possible states of these two electrons you could think that well it's just like two bits of a classical computer right if you have two bits you can write 0 0 0 1 1 0 one and it's for numbers but these are still just two bits of information right all I need to say to determine which one of the four numbers you have in your computer code is the value of the first bit and the value of the secretary here instead quantum mechanics allows it to make superposition of each one of these four states so I can write a quantum mechanical state which is perfectly legitimate that is some coefficient times this plus some coefficient times that plus some coefficient and that plus some coefficient so to determine the state of this two spin system I need to give you four numbers four coefficients whereas in the classical example of the two bits I only need to give you two bits so this is how you understand why two qubits actually contain four bits of information I need to give you four numbers to tell you the state of the system whereas here only need two if we make three spins we would have eight different states I need to give you eight different numbers to define the state of those three spins whereas classical is just three bits if you keep going what you'll find is that the amount of equivalent classical information contained by n qubits is two to the power n classical bits and of course the power of Exponential's tells you that once you have let's say 300 of those qubits in what we call the fully entangled state so you must be able to create these really crazy states where there is a superposition of all three others being one way and another way in the other way and so on then you have like two to the three hundred classical bits which is as many particles as there are universe but there's a catch although the qubits can exist in any combination of states when they are measured they must fall into one of the basis states and all the other information about this before the measurement is lost so you don't walk generally to have as the final result of your quantum computation something that is a very complicated superposition of states because you cannot measure a superposition you can only measure one of these basis States so what you want is to design the logic operations that you need to get to the final computational result in such a way that the final result is something you're able to measure it's just a unique state there's no trigger and it's essentially kind of stretching things there but I guess it's to some degree the reason why quantum computers are not a replacement for classical no no they're not universally faster they're only faster for special types of calculations where you can use the fact that you have all these quantum superpositions available to you at the same time to do some kind of computational parallelism if you just want to watch a video in height in high-definition or browse the internet or write some document in Word they're not gonna give you any particular rule if you need to use a classical algorithm to get yourself so you should not think of a quantum computer as something where every operation is faster in fact every operation is probably gonna be slower then in the computer you have the desk but it's an a computer where the number of operations required to arrive at the result is exponentially small so the improvement is not in the speed of the individual operation is in the total number of operations you need to arrive at the result but that is only the case in particular types of calculations in particular algorithm is not universally which is why it's not a replacement of a classical","zNzzGgr2mhk":"to find the prime factors of a 2048-bit number it would take a classical computer millions of years a quantum computer could do it in just minutes and that is because a quantum computer is built on qubits these devices which take advantage of quantum superposition to reduce the number of steps required to complete the computation but how do you actually make a qubit in practice and how do you read and write information on it I met up with researchers who are using the outermost electron in a phosphorus atom as a qubit this single phosphorus atom is embedded in a silicon crystal right next to a tiny transistor now the electron has a magnetic dipole called its spin and it has two orientations up or down which are like the classical 1 & 0 now to differentiate the energy state of the electron when it's in spin up and spin down you need to apply a strong magnetic field and to do that we use a superconducting magnet so superconducting magnet is a large solenoid is a coil of superconducting wire that sits inside of that vessel as full of liquid helium so now the electron will line up with its spin pointing down that's its lowest energy state and it would take some energy to put it into the spin up state but actually not that much energy and if it were at room temperature the electron would have so much thermal energy that it would be bouncing around from spin up to spin down and back and so you need to cool down the whole apparatus to only a few hundredths of a degree above absolute zero that way you know that the electron will definitely be spin down there is not enough thermal energy in the surroundings to flip it the other way now if you want to write information onto the qubit you can put the electron into the spin up state by hitting it with a pulse of microwaves but that pulse needs to be a very specific frequency and that frequency depends on the magnetic field that the electron is sitting in so what you see here is the frequency that is being produced by this microwave source and it's 45.0 21 gigahertz which in the magnetic field that we are applying now is the resonance frequency of the electric so the electron is a little bit like a radio they can only tune into one station and when that station is broadcasting the electron gets all excited and turns to the spin up state but you can stop at any point so if you just make it mutate and stop your pulse at some specific point what you've created is a special quantum superposition of the spin-up and spin-down states with a specific phase between the two super positions and how do you read out the information will you use the transistor that this phosphorus atom is embedded next to the spin down has the lower energy and the spin up as the higher energy now in this transistor there is in fact a little puddle of electrons this puddle of electrons is filled up up to a certain energy so this vertical axis here is energy and here we were all these electrons that line up in energy just like the electrons on the shells of an atom so now if the electron is pointing up it can jump into the transistor but because it has more energy than all the others it leaves behind the bare nuclear charge of the phosphorous right the phosphorous one more positive charge in the nucleus as compared to silicon but normally it's neutralized by the extra electron so the two things cancel out but if you take the electron away then the phosphorous has a positive charge so it says if you have a positive voltage a more positive voltage applied to this game it doesn't come from the gate it comes from the atom but it's the same it's just a positive voltage it's like the transistor has been switched more on and so you see a pulse of current and that indicates that the electron was in the spin up State in this measurement phase if you find one of these spikes of current it's because you had an electron spin up so you can play catching a spin up or spin down electrum you see there was no current here that was a spin down alike and try again again a spin down elector in effect now these researchers have actually gone further using the nucleus of the phosphorus atom as a qubit like an electron the nucleus has a spin although it's 2,000 times weaker than the spin of the electron but you can still write to it the same way using electromagnetic radiation only it needs to be a longer wavelength and a longer pulse in order to get the spin to flip because it's so small so weakly magnetic and so perfectly isolated from the rest of the world it's a qubit that lives for a very long time but how do you read out the spin of the nucleus well you use the electron remember that the electrons frequency that it will respond to depends on the magnetic field that it's sitting in so that magnetic field is the external magnetic field that is produced by the superconducting magnet but there is also an internal magnetic field coming from the nucleus but that internal magnetic field can have two directions right the nucleus can be pointing up or down itself so what it means is that there are two frequencies at which the electron can respond depending on the direction of the nucleus so the nucleus actually acts as a little selector it tells the electron basically which radio station it can listen to so what you're looking at now is an experiment where we actually flip the nucleus every five seconds so for five seconds you will see that the electron always responds because the nucleus is always in the right direction to make the electron respond to the frequency by applying to the electron and then for the other five seconds the electron will not respond because we have flipped the nucleus the other way so now what you see in this period of time the nucleus has been flipped down yeah and now after five seconds it will flip up the same trend starts responding yeah so you are watching on the oscilloscope screen in real time the measurement of the direction of a single nucleus and our ability to flip it at will every five seconds sing all nucleus now because all of this depends so sensitively on magnetic fields you need to make sure to eliminate all spin from the silicon crystal but unfortunately natural silicon contains about 5% the isotope silicon 29 and that does have a spin but in fact the beauty of silicon is that it has this isotope called silicon 28 that has no nuclear spin the nuclear spin is zero so it's a completely non-magnetic atom but where are you going to find a pure crystal of silicon 28 oh wait these isotopically purified silicon 28 crystals are being produced anyway for a purpose completely different from quantum computing they're being produced to redefine the kilogram through the Avogadro project so the offcuts from that silicon sphere are actually being used as the home for qubits that I think is incredible there is no waste in this science hey there this episode of veritasium was supported by audible.com a leading provider of audiobooks with over a hundred thousand

Angeles and contrary to what you may have heard their main purpose is not to reduce evaporation so what are they really for to find out I'm visiting the largest collection of these balls anywhere on earth at la reservoir 96 million shade balls that's correct 96 million it's it's very rare for you to see 96 million of anything this is your life vest which you are required to wear all right throw a leg over and climb on in anyway looking at this I had so many questions like why are they black are they safe to have in drinking water how much do they cost do they actually reduce evaporation and what is their real purpose there's a hard to drive in shape out it is very hard why is that these are actually partially filled with water and you really reason to fill with water is that at la res where we have some really high winds and so you know if we didn't put water these things there'd be balls down so bouncing on the five freeways people drive down it would be all over the place so so these keep the balls in the reservoir and if they do start to roll they kind of wobble because of water makes them uneven but that makes them significantly more difficult to push out of the way especially when they form close-packed crystal like structures behind the boat the balls quickly come together in our wake and some close to the motor are pulled along with the boat did you what did you think the first time they suggested doing this or when it when it first came in yeah it was a little out there did you think they were nuts no not nuts what'd he just say like it looks absurd it's like we're in the world's biggest ball pit right yeah that's what it looks like yeah you what you can't tell by standing here that we're actually floating over I think it's probably 40 40 feet right here 40 50 feet deep below us and we can't even see any water you'd think it was a joke right like if you didn't know you'd be like no you're not that's you're a green-screen or something right yeah it's fake so like when I switch on my tap at home is the water coming from here sometimes or always most of the time most of the time the water's coming from here absolutely nuts so why is LA reservoir covered in shade balls well the problem all started with bromide bromide is a naturally occurring substance it's associated with salt water and so normally places like the California Aqueduct that comes down from the Delta youth's of saltwater intrusion she have some bromide in the water ro bites harmless and it's almost impossible to remove but when you when you disinfect the water with ozone that bromide becomes bromate and bro-mates carcinogenic and so around the year 2000 they wrote regulations regulating bromate and the regulations basically said if you have a treatment plant that uses ozone then you have to watch your bromate formation to be careful not to form too much so the only place we ever measured bromate was that our filter plant and the results were always within the 10 micrograms per liter limit set by regulators so they were confused when they got a call from one of their customers a beverage company in LA they said we have some really high levels of row mates showing up are you where this and we've said well we don't show anything but between the filtration plant and the customer was the reservoir so they did some tests almost immediately upon coming into the soap and reservoir the bromate levels jumped it turned out that bromide with chlorine which was supposed to be safe in bright sunlight form bromate even more than ozone and so we made this an unfortunate scientific discovery that actually was not part of any regulatory scheme and so here we are at the reservoir we have water source that's got bromide in it harmless we have corn we have to have to disinfect the water and we have sunlight because it's open the only choice we have is to remove sunlight so we looked at all sorts of things we looked at floating tarps across the water and normally you put a floating cover on the water but that's the multi-year project and so we've said well can we manufacture these kind of trampolines with Polly like TVC pipe and we said we think it's gonna become bird perches it'll have a big water quality problem and so then we knew we had high density polyethylene pipe which is used in the water industry and and we know that it floats we at one point thought about can we get flow to pile a pipe across the surface well that's hard to do and very expensive because it's a lot of material so maybe we could take some pipe and run it through a chipper and we can make a debris field across the surface like the back corner of a lake somewhere but anyhow all this mushy warm water with plastic floating on the top that sounds like a petri dish and so lo and behold dr. Brian white did some research and he and he found the shade ball except they weren't called shade balls at the time this product existed and they were called bird balls and they use it on pawns that had mine tailings where they didn't want waterfowl to go in and get poison and also around airports where ponds and they want to eat the waterfowl off so that they didn't take off and get in to get engines you know they'd actually done a Windtunnel testing and they had you know blue you know 50 60 mile an hour winds across does he see how they behave but they're really made to deter Birds or wildlife from sitting on the water did there used to be birds landing here more like yeah once we deployed these balls all the birds were gone they used to just hang out right loiter at the kerbs yeah they'd be all over the top of the dam they'd be down at the outlet Tower they'd be everywhere but we don't get them anymore like we used to but before being added to the reservoir the shade balls had to be tested would they actually reduce the formation of bromate and we bought 3 kiddie pools filled with inflatable kiddie pools and we filled them all with the reservoir water one was in the sunlight when we put a tarp on when we put shade balls on and amazingly the shade balls knocked out the problem he needed so the reason shaped balls are black is to block all light from reaching the water and triggering the bromate reaction the black pigment is also safe for contact with drinking water and it's stable even exposed to the elements for years they're black for a reason so you know they're made out of high-density polyethylene it's the same material that like a gallon milk jug is made out of it's a food grade plastic and and they would be clear like a milk carton except that they wouldn't last in the Sun and so they have a material called carbon black in there and that's what makes the the plastic last for at least ten years out of the Sun we did tests to see if there's any other colors we could use so we actually had the company make three different shades of blue but the dyes were so unstable they said we can't guarantee it's gonna last more than a year and so it's that carbon black this is the magic powder in this that really makes this product laughs in the sunlight one of the concerns that that people raised to me when we first put these on was that are they going to get hot and then leach and they don't they're totally inert I mean theoretically you get kind of pieces ball and you can chew it no harm comes to you this is this is totally food grade nothing wrong with it whatsoever what's it like driving through these things it's difficult as you can see we've been sitting here for I don't know how long quite a while and there's a breeze and we haven't moved I mean anybody that knows that's been on a boat in a lake if there's a slight breeze and you're on a boat you're drifting right not here this thing that they're just stable that you it's interesting when you try to pilot the boat through these things that's difficult it's like driving through peanut butter or something I guess yeah not that I've ever done that blocking sunlight from the reservoir also provided additional benefits you know one of the reasons we put so much chlorine in was to control the algae growth but sometimes you still couldn't control it there were times years ago in the summer where if we had an algae outbreak you might actually if you filled a bathtub up you might have a slight tinge of green I mean it may be healthy to drink but it might have a slight tinge of green from the algae of algae yeah and and it's just discolouring the water that no longer kurtz so with the sunlight gone the algae problem is gone and we put in basically no chlorine we've only had a few times since the shade balls went on la reservoir that we've added any chlorine at all and we used to do half the chlorine in the whole whole water system went into that reservoir just to control algae growth but the big concern I had was evaporation when I first heard about these black plastic balls reducing evaporation it didn't seem to make any sense I mean wouldn't they absorb more energy and so heat up the water leading to faster evaporation it turns out the answer is no for a number of reasons in an open reservoir there is more exposed surface area where water molecules can escape into the air plus there is greater airflow over the water surface continually removing the layer of moist air and replacing it with drier air increasing evaporation now the shape balls do absorb more energy and get hotter on top but the bottom of the balls stays cool plus the balls contain mostly air which is a good thermal insulator and so not much of the heat is transferred through to the water it's almost like a double pane window you get that air gap in there and the air acts as an insulator and so the Sun never hits the water matter fact we've actually done some measurements and it's actually cooler the che balls even though they're black than it is without the balls just with the Sun itself so the balls actually have a slight cooling effect so for all of these reasons shade balls reduce evaporation by eighty to ninety percent that's pretty significant for a dry climate like Los Angeles how much do they cost these run about around three for a dollar I think we paid thirty three thirty four cents apiece something that ranged so Andy and they actually have a salvage value not that much but if we go to remove them they're their recyclable material so but but we've figured that over the life of the balls between the savings and chlorination is the chemical savings and the savings in evaporation probably at least half the cost of the balls will be paid for and so I me of course the water quality benefit is immeasurable but even the balls themselves will save money doing what they do do you ever bring people out here for the first one to get to go on a tour here this is so cool I've heard something about hexagonal balls not anything about hexagonal balls oh my gosh so we have the shade balls of course everyone in the world came up with another product I have once I call it the ravioli is a small hex we had large hexes we had all sorts of pieces and people say well they lock together and but the problem is they need to not stack up and they need to not sit in the bank of the reservoir the reservoir is gonna go up and down and so it's really the shape of the ball that that makes them not not perch on the side because we need to make sure that these where the water goes up and down that they spread up or they you know it's going to spread out completely to cover the water as best possible I mean I just can't get over what I'm seeing it's just so nuts I'm waiting for you to say it looks like a pull of Bauby I feel like that's the line that'll go into you you gotta that's awesome do you like boho I love Bobo","mXVGIb3bzHI":"I'm going to scream as loud as I can and I'm gonna keep screaming as loud as I can while I spin around I'll keep going until my breath runs out right the quietest place on earth is apparently an anechoic chamber in Minneapolis now I'm here at BYU at their anechoic chamber anechoic is latin that basically means no echo and the way they achieve no echo is through all of these foam wedges which are put on the walls and even the floor you can see that I'm actually on a spring floor and down below me there are all of these wedges now you may want to use headphones while you're listening to this video because that's going to be quite important low-frequency sound will come in and by the shape of it bounce and just keep bouncing pretty much forever until it just gets lost in the wall and then high frequencies are more so going to get absorbed into the foam itself you can hear how the room Devin's echoes by clapping constantly while closing the doors totally change the quality of the same there are reports that it's impossible to stay in one of these rooms and remain sane for a significant period of time the record is apparently 45 minutes a little claustrophobic I got it felt like there's a lot of pressure on my head but why would that be I mean the air is no different in here what I figured is just because when you listen in a normal room there's a lot of reverb to your ear that means there's a lot of space but there's none of that in here so it feels claustrophobic it feels like you're in a tiny room like you're you could be in a coffin I think it's really an anxiety response so you're used to having these sounds around you and then you don't anymore and so you start to panic because you don't have something you're used to and I think that anxiety can increase it caused some stress and maybe that's why people go crazy or hallucinate with sound it's just cuz they're trying to make up for what they're used to that isn't there when I bring people and I warn them hey if you get a little dizzy please let me know so I can get you out of the room before you make a mess in in our expensive facilities first you'll hear any rustle of your clothing so you move an inch and you'll hear it then you'll hear any fluids that are in your mouth or your throat you'll hear them all moving around every time you move your mouth and the longer you stay there the more you go so you start to hear the blood flow through your brain have you heard it well it sounds kind of like a ringing or a pulsing can you can I make the sound for us so that we know what the listener over there of the blood flow yeah like I was like a pulsing like some people say they can hear their heartbeat coming from their chest as well - have you heard that no mm-hmm a violinist placed in one of these rooms was apparently banging on the door within a matter of seconds trying to get out now that people say it's impossible to stand up because you become so disoriented dizzy nauseous and and some people even hear aural hallucinations but to me it doesn't sound right you know I believe that I should be able to sit in a room with no sound with the lights off for as long as I like and so I'm gonna put myself to the test by staying in this room for as long as I can have fun in silence thank you now it is just me in the anechoic chamber and this is probably the quietest place I have ever been in a second I'll tell the guys shut the lights off okay I think I'm ready and the lights are off I'm going to turn off the camera so I don't have this light and then there's only the audio recorder that I'll keep with me I'm not sure how long I've been in here but I still feel quite comfortable it's uh it's nice and quiet I mean that's an understatement but it's um it's relaxing if I hear anything I feel like I hear a low-pitched hum [Music] [Music] if I had to guess about how long I'd been in here I'd say about eight minutes I feel like I'm more aware of my heart I can feel each pulse and I can almost feel it radiating up my chest towards my head like a wave I might use their the hist I think that's just from hearing loss this just reminds me of that Mission Impossible movie where Tom Cruise sneaks into that building and he has to keep his decibel level low that was the burp don't know if you could do that can say the really small sounds seem amplified it's like your brain has recalibrated for the quiet things seem much flatter I feel like I can feel more things like with every beat of my heart it feels like my body shakes a little bit like a device that has a little motor inside it how it gets shook around like a phone okay Cameron looks to me like we're good for time if it looks the same to you like we're in 46 minutes or over I'm happy to hop out so yeah when you're ready you give the lights back on if you like hey there hello I think I've been here for nearly an hour according to my time jokes and and I didn't fall asleep I just you know I've had a good time it's a nice quiet space I kind of feel like this would be a good material to pad your bedroom in not a problem anechoic chamber 45 minutes an hour easy I could stay in here for five hours I think I could get a lot of work done in here so now I just have to get out and I'm gonna see if I can exit this room without them turning a lifetime even the door is nice and quiet here we are back to the outside world hey don't live and I don't really understand how anyone could go crazy in there I mean quiet is kind of nice but then again there are people who find all sorts of situations really uncomfortable like just being in a pitch-black room or being a small confined space so maybe those types of people would find this kind of unnerving I definitely noticed that there were a lot of noises like it wasn't just pure silence like I actually have to work hard to make things feel silent otherwise you know there was the sound of like just me rubbing my beard or or just like the rustle of your clothes or every time you swallow when you breathe perhaps the weirdest thing I noticed was like my sense of my heart I just felt like it was pumping really hard and and I could feel almost like the blood pushing up through me it wasn't like I was hearing it it was just like I was feeling it and I was feeling as though in a way my heart was shaking my body that was something weird but besides that nothing nothing crazy no no weird hallucinations or anything like that so I think the the myth that you can't stay in here for a longer than 45 minutes is is busted even though this is not Mythbusters I still think it's it's not true now if you really hate silence you should always carry an audio book around with you and I can recommend a good one The Fault in Our Stars by my friend John Green it is an excellent book and it's been basically at the top of the bestsellers ever since it was released and soon there's a movie coming out and

be really really careful i promise i will be so incredibly careful i will be incredibly careful with that okay i promise all right so it's slippery be careful all right are you ready i'm about to touch a one kilogram sphere of silicon 28 atoms they're about 2.15 times 10 to the 25 of them it feels absolutely incredible wow that is amazing besides its creators i am one of only a handful of people ever to hold this sphere the raw material used to make it was worth 1 million euros but now that it has been so precisely sculpted how much is that worth it's priceless this you're looking at now is the roundest object in the world how can you say for sure that it's the roundest object i mean the earth is pretty grand isn't it if this was the earth if this were the earth in the highest mountain and the lowest valley would be about 14 meters apart [Laughter] that is shocking that is shockingly round but why would you invest 1 million euros and thousands of man hours perfecting a pure polished silicon sphere well the answer is grey or rather grav as it would have been pronounced in the original french you see the graph was the original name for the base unit of mass in the metric system which became the system internationale dunite or si units in 1793 a commission which included notable scientists and aristocrat antoine lavoisier defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting temperature of ice essentially just a liter of ice water the name grav came from the latin gravitas meaning weight but it wasn't to last it sounded too similar to the aristocratic title graph which is the equivalent of an earl or account and with the french revolution in full swing with a rallying cry of equality for all you couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others at this lavoisier lost his head literally not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of all time but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman so things really were grave the new republican government believed a grav would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and so they settled on a gram which was just a thousandth of a grav but soon they realized that a gram was too small and so they returned to the grav but since they couldn't call it that they invented the kilogram a thousand grams and that is why out of the seven base si units the kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name in 1799 the kilogram definition was refined to be the mass of a liter of water at four degrees celsius the temperature at which it is densest but water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard so a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition and it was declared kilogram of the archives now it's important to note at this point the kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water the kilogram of the archives is by definition the kilogram 90 years later in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded to a platinum iridium alloy cylinder now it was much harder than the original but was otherwise basically identical and to this day it remains the definition of the kilogram it is officially called the international prototype kilogram though it's affectionately known as legrand k or big k o and it's about this big it is the only thing in the entire universe with a mass of exactly one kilogram because it is the kilogram it is also the only si unit that is still defined by a physical object it sits under three bell jars next to six sister kilograms in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled keys in the basement of the international bureau of weights and measures on the outskirts of paris now if you were able to break into the vault and tamper with big k you would actually be changing the definition of the kilogram a definition on which many of our measurements rely and so you would throw the world into chaos well no not actually but how would anyone ever know if the mass of big k changed well when it was first created 40 identical replicas were also made well they weren't quite identical they had a mass which was slightly different to big k but those offsets were recorded now these replicas were sent out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards in 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a weigh-in and this is when the problem started because even though all the cylinders were made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions their masses had diverged over time the mass of big k wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with it and to make matters worse when they were brought together again 40 years later their masses had further diverged up to about 50 micrograms that's about the weight of a fingerprint but fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully washed before their weigh-ins so some physical process must have actually changed the mass of the cylinders but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation one thing is for certain the mass of a platinum iridium cylinder is not stable over time and this is a big problem you can't have a unit which changes its value and the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base si units four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram not to mention all the derived units like newtons jewels volts and watts at this point those of you in countries that have not adopted the metric system yes i'm speaking to you liberia burma and the u.s you may be feeling rather smug that your base unit of mass the avoid pound is no longer defined by a physical object no instead it is defined as precisely nine 0.453592 three seven kilograms sucked in so clearly something needs to be done to eliminate the kilograms dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes in but how exactly does that help here you have a physical object and it's beautiful but you know it's still a physical object you're trying to get away from that we're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular object is counting how many atoms are in there you can't actually count how many are in there can you you can't count how many are in there but you can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon there's no voids or dislocations so this is like a perfect crystal of silicon that's right not only is it pure silicon it contains only one isotope of silicon silicon 28 and that explains why the original material was so expensive and why a sphere well a sphere is a pretty simple object if you know the diameter of the sphere you can characterize the entire dimension of the object well that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created but how do you actually make something that round we actually start with an oversized sphere so it was about two millimeters larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively finer and finer using abrasive it's actually massaging atoms you're down at that level of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level but making the sphere is only half the battle then you need to accurately measure its diameter the diameter is actually measured via a laser so you're actually measuring having the sphere in the center of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the gap by knowing the diameter you can determine its volume and since the atom spacing of silicon is known to high precision you can then calculate how many atoms make up the sphere this allows you to redefine avogadro's constant at the moment avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram it is equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 but using this approach the number of silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix avogadro's constant which would then define the kilogram so even if the silicon spheres were lost or damaged it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined not by a physical object but by a concept if you would like to see the official definition of the kilogram say a kilogram is the mass of 2.15 times 10 to the 25 silicon 28 atoms yes is it there's a there's a likelihood a high likelihood that it's going to happen but there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing planks constant and it's done using something called a watt balance these two approaches are complementary each one provides a check on the other and if they show good agreement and are able to bring their uncertainties down to about 20 micrograms they may redefine the kilogram as early as 2014 and then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit no longer defined by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in paris now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a liter of water at its densest temperature then how well did we do well if you look at a liter of water at nearly 4 degrees celsius it has a mass of 999.975 grams so i guess you could look at this two ways on the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be but on the other hand 214 years ago scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct within the margin of error of a grain of rice now that is truly remarkable now if you want to hear more about the walk balance let me know in the comments and i will see what i can do it does seem to be the front runner in terms of redefining the kilogram so we will have to wait and see what happens one last thing i should point out that it took an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you think that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some of the credit well in 1787 that was none other than antoine lavoisier so he's been involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave","GeyDf4ooPdo":"I am here at the University of Sydney where the mechanical engineering shop has built this incredible piece of apparatus for me it is a 40 pound that is 19 kilogram flywheel on the end of a meter long shaft can you imagine trying to hold this out horizontally with just one hand at this end it is virtually it is impossible okay now I'm gonna let go you gonna be able to hold this at all I've shot can you lift it out make your horizontal hold it hold it hold it come on just try it I want you to hold it out horizontal see if you can go with it oh come on hmm what I'm gonna do is I'm going to spin this up to a few thousand rpm and then I'm going to attempt just that hold it from one end and have it out horizontally 301 when a lick go of my left hand what you'll see is that the shaft remains horizontal and see it going around there it almost looks as though the wheel is weightless how does this work well instead of pulling the wheel down to the ground as you'd expect the weight of the wheel creates a torque which pushes it around in a circle you may recognize this as gyroscopic precession for a more detailed explanation click the annotation or the link in the description to see my video on the topic here I want to try something more extreme I'm going to try to lift it over my head with one hand while it's spinning wish me luck but before I make the attempt rod wisely suggests that I first check if I can lift the wheel above my head without it spinning let's prove that I can lift it just this end without it spinning here we go ah how I mean it's just kind of awkward at the hand okay oh just barely oh goodness do you even lift ah clearly I do not unde anted by my lack of strength I'm going for it but I want to make sure that the wheel is spinning as fast as possible to give me the best chance of success get a 10 more side of pen eight seven six five four oh that was perfect now I'm going to release my left hand and holding only with my right hand at the end of the shaft I'll try to lift it up over my head this is a 40 pound 19 kilogram flywheel ready here we go three two one beautiful let's go again in three two one nice five three two one it feels incredibly incredibly light as I do that you when you said it felt incredibly live yeah when you're lifting it feels like yeah shouldn't I know honestly I have lifted it up with one hand when it's not spinning yeah and it feels really hard to lift it up like it's big effort yeah but with this when it's spinning it honestly felt like it was just wanting to go up by itself yes it felt like I was not struggling like I was not putting in the amount of force that you think to lift that kind of weight I'll bet if you let it go it would crush down to the ground it's not like we can't do that though we can't do that part of the experiment what we could maybe do is I could stand on a scale we could see what the weight of me Plus that apparatus does while I'm lifting it up over my head see if I get lighter in essence you can see that just my weight is about 72 kilograms now when I pick up the flywheel it goes up to about 91 kilograms which makes sense because the flywheel itself is about 19 kilos that's 42 pounds now we're going to spin it up and I want you to make a prediction as I'm lifting it over my head do you think the scale reading will be more less than or equal to 91 kilograms what do you think you can make your prediction by clicking on one of the on-screen annotations or if you're on mobile you can click a link in the description five four three two one horse you","AeJ9q45PfD0":"this is era Joe the world's lightest that is least dense solid this piece has a mass of just one point two two grams that is only a few times the mass of the same volume of air which kind of makes sense because it is 99.8% air in fact some aerogels are so light that if you removed all the air from them they would be less dense than air I have long been fascinated by aerogel so I actually flew out to aerogel technologies in Boston to find out why was era gel invented how is it made why is it such a good thermal insulator and what is it used for okay we are going to try an experiment to demonstrate the insulating power of aerogel so over here we have two setups one with a glass petri dish and the other one with aerogel on top both are made of silica but with very different physical structures we're gonna see how long it takes to melt these chocolate bunnies with a Bunsen burner now to have a look at this experiment we have a fleur t 1020 which can see temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Celsius yeah you can see that the glass is getting really hot already and after just a minute oh okay oh yeah here we go we've got liquid chocolate situation we have some smoking bunny over here the bunny is actually sort of melting over and look it's sort of tilting to the side what is that not only did the bunny melt quickly the petri dish cracked under the thermal expansion so now let's try the aerogel so how is aerogel invented back in 1931 a guy named professor Samuel Kistler had a bet with his colleague Charles learn it bet revolved around jellies like peanut butter and jelly jellies now the thing about jellies is they are actually a combination of liquids and solids I mean they're mostly liquid but it's embedded within this 3d solid structure so if you think with gel like jello has a skeleton with nano sized pores that gives it its rigidity and then that's about 1% of the gel so the bet was this could you remove the liquid from the jelly without affecting the solid structure I mean if you just evaporate the liquid out well then the solid structure shrinks because as you remove liquid molecules they pull on each other and they pull on the solid structure around them basically crumpling it from the inside now Samuel Kistler solved this problem in two ways first he realized you could replace one liquid with another inside the jelly just by washing it thoroughly so you could swap out say water for alcohol and then if you take the jelly and put it in a high pressure vessel called a autoclave by heating it to the high temperature high pressure point called the critical points of the liquid that liquid transformed into a semi liquid semi gas called a supercritical fluid at this point there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas those molecules are no longer pulling on each other and so once you've depressurized the vessel that solid skeleton that 1% of the mass of the gel is left behind intact except for where there was liquid in the pores before is now gas and that solid skeleton that nano porous solid is what we call aerogel Kistler published his findings in nature in 1931 it is getting pretty hot as you can see through the thermal camera but coming up on three minutes there's still no sign of melted chocolate so we're gonna pull out a thermocouple and just check the temperature underneath the bunny like underneath the aerogel and see what what the flame temperature is you can kind of see that that parts of the bunny are getting hot but it's not the bottom of the bunny it's all the around the bunny exactly that Becht of heat is moving up and around the aerogel so you can see the thing is getting red-hot and by four minutes the bunny is looking a little soft pretty good though considering how easy it is to melt chocolate can I put my finger here be careful it's not that it's hot it's that it's brew right but yeah totally cool to touch right it is it is just warm to the touch he made aerogels out of all sorts of things he made them out of eggs he made them out of rubber out of nitrocellulose and include in there was silica actually right here on the table I have some examples of some silica gels this is a a wet silica gel it's kind of rubbery so I can just you know carve out a piece it is 97 percent alcohol inside of its pores and then the remaining 3 percent solid is amorphous silica just can I touch it yeah absolutely it's kind of rubbery not that strong so was i cracking it there or was it a Reno oh whoa very easy to break very crumbly the next step is to replace the alcohol in the gel with liquid carbon dioxide we're about to see liquid co2 liquid co2 has the advantage of being non flammable plus it's got a low critical temperature open up it's flooding in there goes just another solvent what temperature is it on the bottom we're at 600 right now excelsis that's 1250 barrels right now notice where the bunny is melting it's melting right on that edge where the heats like the flame is kind of crawling up and over so Oh bunny down well not a bad result not a bad result at all I'm interested in in tasting some of this chocolate here hot it's warm warm and delicious like fondue mm-hmm I was great once the liquid co2 has filled all the pores of the gel it's time to take it supercritical it was I would say a kind of a spiritual experience the first time that I saw a supercritical fluid I loved how much you're into these autoclaves I love air gels to make a supercritical fluid we can heat this with a hairdryer actually as we approach the critical point the surface of the liquid becomes kind of blurry weird huh that is like weird waves in there yeah I'll speed it up so you can watch the surface disappear altogether you're now looking at the supercritical fluid of co2 in this state the co2 can be vented without affecting the solid structure and what you're left with is aerogel if you look at aerogel on a light background it's almost impossible to see because it is pretty transparent but if you look at it on a darker background then you can see that it has a slight bluish color and it's bluish for the same reason that the sky is blue because all those tiny little nanoscale structures they scatter the light according to Rayleigh scattering and the intensity of light scattered is proportional to one over wavelength to the power of four which means it scatters shorter wavelengths like blue much more than it scatters yellow or red and for that reason aerogel looks opaque in the ultraviolet and transparent in the infrared now what do you think this would look like if I held it up to the blue sky what do you think we would see would it look ultra blue no it looks yellow and that's because the aerogel is actually scattering out that blue light and so what passes through and makes it to our eyes is the longer wavelengths like the yellows and oranges it's basically the same effect as looking at a sunset when you see the yellows and oranges of a sunset it's because the blue light has already been scattered out by the atmosphere the light had to pass through before it reached your eyes so effectively looking at aerogel against blue sky is like looking at a portable sunset the nanoscale pores of the aerogel are also what makes it such a good thermal insulator that's awesome does that look hot it's definitely hot you might think that because aerogel is largely comprised of air like 99% air that it has the same thermal properties as air but that is not correct it's actually a better insulator than air is that's because the width of the pores is smaller than the distance air molecules travel on average before colliding with something they're so-called mean free path hence it's really difficult for the hot fast-moving air molecules below the aerogel to diffuse through it and transfer heat to the top of the aerogel this is called the Knudsen effect it is so weird because you know you don't expect something that's transparent to block the heat that well but this really does and that's why NASA used aerogel insulation on the Sojourner Rover Spirit and Opportunity the Curiosity rover and they plan to use it on future missions to Mars why does it need insulation the electronics because they don't want the electronics to get cold during the cold nights on Mars nASA has also put aerogel to more exotic uses notably to catch dust from a comet as part of the Stardust mission so the particles were traveling about six kilometers per second relative to the aerogel so when they hit the aerogel because their hotels a very low density material very very porous material the particles actually enter the aerogel and as they travel through the aerogel they they basically break apart to the network that makes up the aerogel and they lose energy in the process and eventually come to a stop this is good for capturing particles because of a particle like that where to hit a solid surface then it just stops you know immediately you just vapor and vaporizes so should we expect to see aerogel in our everyday lives anytime soon what am i running jokes is when they build skyscrapers in Antarctica they'll they'll use aerogel as thermal insulation why do you say that well because then they'll really care about how just how thermal efficient is cuz it would be so cold there right so instead of having you know ten feet of fiberglass insulation you could have six inches or something of aerogel scientists are currently working on reducing costs and increasing durability and that's true they do have some less okay yeah and there we go so it is not hard to break they've already made a lot of progress for example original silica aerogel is hydrophilic there we go now this is a hydrophilic aerogel so once we've done this is that piece of aerogel ruined now pretty much but there are ways to make it waterproof so if you want to see that and all the other next generation aerogels then subscribe to the channel and this may be the start of an aerogel trilogy [Music]","2OSrvzNW9FE":"[Applause] recently some friends of mine went to the Gordon dam in Tasmania which is a hundred and twenty six and a half meters or 415 feet high then they dropped a basketball over the edge you can see that the basketball gets pushed around a bit by the breeze but it lands basically right below where it was dropped now watch what happens when they drop another basketball but this time with a bit of backspin this is Brett I literally just dropped it with a bit of spin like I didn't even throw and I just took off I have no idea that was gonna do that and this is where I come in the basketball was subject to the Magnus effect which affects all rotating balls or cylinders as they fly through the air and it works like this as the basketball picks up speed air on the front side of the ball is going in the same direction as its spin and therefore it gets dragged along with the ball and deflected back air on the other side is moving opposite to the ball spin so the flow separates from the ball instead of getting deflected the net result is the ball pushes air one way so the air applies an equal force on the ball the other way and this is known as the Magnus effect named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus who described it in 1852 of course Isaac Newton beat him to it by nearly 200 years describing the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College but you know he's got enough stuff named after him this effect is very important in sports like tennis soccer and golf but could it have non-sport applications perhaps this is a sailboat I know it doesn't look like a sailboat but those aren't chimneys they are spinning cylinders called flettner rotors and they take the place of the sails they deflect crosswinds using the Magnus effect to propel the ship forwards and this is a plane with spinning cylinders instead of wings using the Magnus effect the cylinders actually generate more lift than traditional wings however they also generate way more drag making them practical this plane only flew once and then it crashed but the Magnus effect is making a comeback here is an experimental rotor wing aircraft which generates all its lift from spinning cylinders and this is the e ship one which uses for spinning cylinders that's for flattener rotors to increase its efficiency and reduce the amount of diesel it burns so in the future the Magnus effect may help more than just basketballs fly now the real reason my friends from how ridiculous were at the dam was to set the world record for the highest basket ever scored so go check out their channel and the video and subscribe to them for more epic trick shots [Music]","2awbKQ2DLRE":"yeah go for it now you may have seen a Rubens tube before that's basically a pipe with a bunch of holes in it and you pump in a flammable gas and light it on fire so you basically create a row of Bunsen burners what's really cool is to play some sounds into the tube and you can actually set up standing waves that is there are areas there are patterns of the vibration of the air where there's a lot of vibration in some parts and not very much vibration in other parts now that affects the flow rate of the gas inside that tube into the atmosphere and so it affects the height of those flames so basically you can visualize the standing wave pattern I'm currently in Denmark with a team of physics and chemistry demonstrators who have taken this experiment to the next level they've actually created a two-dimensional Rubens tube a whole plane of a Bunsen burners effectively how many holes in this tube and 2500 2500 in this pyro board so we're gonna see 2500 little flames so do you want to light it up yes I really want to light it up why did you make this because we really like the Rubens tube but then before when you put on fire then it always gets better we can just find us in any way this is below there so what are we seeing here it's pretty much like this anyway so those frequency that makes a standing wave in this box so this is like the fundamental [Music] can you show me what happens when you vary the volume a little bit hahaha that was awesome okay should we try to find another standing wave yes [Music] before it's weird with the microphones I can actually hear like here I'm in a node and then here I'm an antinode here I'm in a no that's all I can I can hear it like here is very much antidote this is an ode and you guys can hear it it's incredible the flames must be coming out in the antinodes the flames are coming up in the engine oh yeah you can even hear it yeah that's incredible that is awesome we just learned something yeah what happens if we try to go higher frequency [Music] [Applause] yeah that's a good one that is crazy we're right in the antidote [Music] she is okay oh my yes i hurting now that was painful what are we try to put something more pleasing to the ear through the speaker and see what happens I think that's good yeah let's put some music on there you ready [Music] [Applause] [Music] so you go around Denmark showing kids all about physics we do that's what we do you show them the pyro board we show them the power board and we show them a whole lot of other stuff and you guys are also on YouTube yep we have a YouTube channel you can go to it on this link right here go check it out if you want to see more of what these guys are up to it's awesome it's great ahoy that is the actual Czech word for hello I have made it to all emot-- in the Czech Republic and this is partly thanks to support from audible.com the leading provider of audiobooks with over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature including fiction nonfiction and periodicals now today I wanted to recommend a book which is a little bit European it's called Galileo's daughter by Dava Sobel I love this book because it includes the actual letters written from Galileo's daughter to him during his life and it really reveals what he must have gone through as a human being I mean we all know about his science and about you know the trials that he went through but to see this kind of insight into his personal life I think is remarkable so you should really check out this book and you can download it for free by going to audible.com\/veritasium or you can pick any other book of your choosing for a one-month free trial so I really want to thank audible for supporting me and allowing me to go and meet great scientists and filmmakers and lots of people all around the world also I should note that I will be hosting Michio Kaku in Brisbane and Melbourne on June fifth and six links in the doobly-doo I would love to see you there thank you so much for watching and I will see you somewhere else in the world bye","oVfHeWTKjag":"have you heard of virtual bagel their Facebook page has over 4000 likes they use the page to promote their brilliant business model we send you bagels via the internet just download and enjoy it sounds like a joke and it is sort of this page was set up by BBC technology correspondent Rory Kalin Jones in 2012 he wanted to find out what is the worth of a like on a Facebook page and so he bought some likes for virtual bagel now there are two ways to buy likes the legitimate way and the illegitimate way the illegitimate way is to go to a website like boost likes calm and purchase some likes you can get a thousand for $70 sites like these use click farms in developing countries like India the Philippines Nepal Sri Lanka Egypt Indonesia and Bangladesh here employees are routinely paid just $1 per thousand clicks of the like button so Facebook explicitly forbids buying likes in this way instead they offer the legitimate way to pay for likes by advertising your page prominently displayed is a link to get more likes with a promise connect with more of the people who matter to you and this is how virtual bagel got its 4000 likes Rory Colin Jones paid $100 to Facebook and the likes rolled in he targeted his ad to the UK and the United States but also to countries like Egypt Indonesia and the Philippines now where do you think virtual bagel was most popular I'll give you a hint it wasn't the US or the UK but within a day he had over 1600 likes mostly from developing countries now what was more problematic was the people who followed virtual bagel looked suspicious for example there was one cairo-based follower whose name was ahmed ronaldo his profile consisted almost exclusively of pictures of Cristiano Ronaldo and he liked 3,000 pages Kalin Jones also observed that his new throng of fans was particularly disengaged just as you'd imagine those from a click farm would be but he hadn't hired a click farm he had paid for Facebook ads this story was reported in July 2012 in August Facebook reported they had identified and deleted 83 million accounts that was 9% of the total at the time this resulted in noticeable drops for popular singers and celebrities so did they delete all of the fake likes nope not even close I know because most of the likes on my Facebook page are not genuine in May 2012 I received a number of emails from Facebook offering me $50 worth of free promotion of my page which at the time had only two thousand likes my YouTube channel had 20 times that following so I thought surely this free paid promotion could help me reach more of the people who mattered to me and immediately I could see the results within just a few days my likes had tripled and they kept on growing thousands per day and after a few months I had 70,000 Facebook Likes which matched my YouTube subscribers at the time now what was weird was my post on Facebook didn't seem to be getting any more engagement than when I just had 2,000 likes if anything they were getting less engagement and I didn't understand why at the time but I've since realized it's because most of those likes I was gaining through Facebook Ads were not from people who were genuinely interested in veritasium how do I know well because fake likes behave very differently from real followers have a look at this graph of the engagement of my Facebook followers now here I'm plotting countries as bubbles so this is Canada and the size of the bubble represents the number of likes I've received from that country so this is the United States it's a nice big bubble now I'm ranking these countries on a horizontal axis based on what percentage of the likes have engaged with my page this month so as you can see roughly 30% of canadians and americans have engaged with my page but they are not as active as the germans we're over 40 percent of my lifes have engaged and they are not as active as the austrians a small but passionate group of veritasium fans at nearly 60% these are all of the other Western countries so you can see that it's common for between 25% and 35% of my page likes to engage with my page every month now here is Egypt where less than 1% of my likes have engaged with my page now this is India the Philippines Pakistan Bangladesh Indonesia Nepal and Sri Lanka that's a big following but no engagement together all of these countries make up 80 thousand likes that's roughly 75% of the total likes I had before my last video and these are the profiles that followed me when I used Facebook advertising and they're worse than useless here's why you make a post Facebook distributes it to a small fraction of the people who like your page just to gauge their reaction if they engage with it by liking commenting and sharing then Facebook distributes the post or more of your likes and even their friends now if you somehow accumulate fake likes Facebook's initial distribution goes out to fewer real fans and therefore it receives less engagement and so consequently you reach a smaller number of people that's how a rising number of fans can result in a drop in engagement and from this Facebook makes money twice over once to help you acquire new fans and then again when you try to reach them I mean your organic reach may be so restricted by the lack of engagement that your only option is to pay to promote the post what's worse there is no way to delete fake likes in bulk all you can do is try to target posts around them and I should reiterate I never bought fake likes I use Facebook's legitimate advertising but the results are as if I had paid for fake likes from a click farm now you might think the solution to all of this is just to exclude countries with click farms from your ad campaigns but unfortunately the problem goes much deeper meet virtual cat a virtual pet like none other it's a page committed to supplying only the worst most annoying drivel you can imagine only an idiot would like this page and that's not just my opinion that's actually what it says in the page description and I should know because I wrote it I created this page yesterday and then I paid $10 to advertise the page through Facebook targeted only to cat lovers in United States Canada Australia and the UK now I expected that because I had excluded all of the big click farm countries and because the page is so terrible that I basically wouldn't get any likes but within 20 minutes I had blown through my whole budget and I got 39 likes so who are these people liking a blank page and costing me 25 cents a piece all of the profiles were from the places I had targeted mostly the US but there was something strange about them all of these people liked a lot of things like hundreds and thousands of things and a lot of the things they liked were odd too like in one account this person like t-mobile AT&T and Verizon they like Jeep and Lexus and Mercedes and Volvo and Volkswagen they like everything other accounts I saw they like kitchen scrubbers and they like mouthwash who reports that on their Facebook page just I had baffles me so the real mystery to me is why someone somewhere would click on ads that they didn't care about without making money from them I mean I don't think these clicks came from bots they're too easy to identify and eliminate and I also don't think for a second Facebook would pay click farms to click on those ads to generate revenue for them so it really seems like a mystery and then in this article I found what I think is the most reasonable hypothesis click farms click the ads for free in order to avoid detection by Facebook's fraud algorithms they like pages other than the ones they've been paid for to seem more genuine I mean you can imagine a thousand likes on a particular page coming from one geographic area in a short period of time would seem pretty suspicious but buried in a torrent of other like activity they would be impossible to identify so workers that these click farms will literally click anything I mean where do you think Facebook's security page is most popular Dhaka Bangladesh what about Google Dhaka what about soccer star David Beckham that's actually Cairo but you take my point so wherever your targeting advertising your page on Facebook is a waste of money I wish Facebook would remove the fake likes from my page and from all the others but that would mean admitting that they have generated significant ad revenue from clicks that weren't genuine which then suppress the reach of pages who had low engagement forcing those pages to pay again to reach inauthentic fans so the truth is Facebook benefits by maintaining this status quo because the reality is nobody likes this many things","BickMFHAZR0":"[Applause] sometimes the simplest questions have the most amazing answers like how can trees be so tall it's a question that doesn't even seem like it needs an answer trees just are tall some of them are over a hundred meters Why should there be a height limit I'll tell you why trees need to transport water from their roots up until their topmost branches in order to survive and that is no trivial task there is a limit to the height that water can be sucked up a tube it's 10 meters if you suck on a long vertical straw the water will go no higher than 10 meters at this point there'll be a perfect vacuum at the top of the straw and the water will start to boil spontaneously for a tree to raise water a hundred meters it would have to create a pressure difference of 10 atmospheres how would trees do that when I posed this conundrum a lot of people said the answer is transpiration and that's when water evaporates from the leaf pulling up the water molecules behind it and that's clearly a mechanism a tree can use to create suction but it doesn't help us overcome this 10 meter limit below as the pressure can go as a pure vacuum which I imagine is not happening instead of tree leaves right right Hank so you might suspect that a tree does not contain continuous straw like tubes the tree effectively has vowels in it so you don't have a column of water this big tube what you're saying needs to be filled with water it's actually made up of cells although these are good speculations they don't turn out to be correct scientists who study trees find that the xylem tubes that transport water do contain a continuous water column so how else could the tree transport water from the roots to the leaves they don't suck they don't use a vacuum okay so how do they do it wheezing like a cow like you squeezing the cow letter all the way up as little three muscles in there yeah besides being a giant waste of energy all of the cells that make up the xylem tubes are dead what about osmotic pressure if there is more solute in the roots than in the surrounding soil water would be pushed up the tree but some trees live in mangroves where the water is so salty that osmotic pressure actually acts in the other direction so the tree needs additional pressure to suck water into the tree then it must be capillary action the thinner the tube the the water can climb but the tubes in a tree are too wide at 22 200 micro meters in diameter water should rise less than a meter so how do trees do it well one of the assumptions we made is wrong the lowest the pressure can go is if your vacuum your vacuum your back in a gas this is true when you eliminate all of the gas molecules the pressure is zero and you have a perfect vacuum but in a liquid you can go lower than zero pressure and actually get negative pressures in a solid we would think of this as tension this means that the molecules are pulling on each other and their surroundings as the water evaporates from the pores of the cell wall they create immense negative pressures of minus 15 atmospheres in an average tree think about the air water interface at the pore there is one atmosphere of pressure pushing in and negative 15 atmospheres of suction on the other side so why doesn't the meniscus break because the pores are tiny only two to five nanometers in diameter at this scale water's high surface tension ensures the air water boundary can withstand huge pressures without caving as you move down the tree the pressure increases up to atmospheric at the roots so you can have a large pressure difference between the top and the bottom of the tree because the pressure at the top is so negative but hang on if the pressure at the top is negative 15 atmospheres shouldn't the water be boiling yes yes it should but changing phase from liquid to gas requires activation energy and that can come in the form of a nucleation site like a tiny air bubble that's why it's so important that the xylem tubes contain no air bubbles and they can do this because unlike a straw they've been water filled from the start this way water remains in the metastable liquid state when it really should be boiling it's just like supercooled water remains liquid even though it should be ice so you could say that the water in a tree is super sucked because it remains liquid at such negative pressures and why are trees moving all this water up the tree I want you to make a guess say it out loud for photosynthesis actually no less than 1% of the water is used in photosynthetic reactions and other ideas okay what about growth well 5% of the water is used to make new cells so what happens to be other 95% of the water it just evaporates for each molecule of carbon dioxide that tree takes in it loses hundreds of molecules of water whoa can you believe how amazing this is trees create huge negative pressures of tens of atmospheres by evaporating water through nanoscale pores sucking water up a hundred meters in a state where it should be boiling but can't because the perfect eylem tubes contain no air bubbles just so that most of it can evaporate in the process of absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide I will never look at trees the same way again I'd like to say a huge thank you to Hank Henry and professor Polyakov for making on camera hypotheses this is an essential part of the scientific process even if your hypothesis turns out to be wrong as Einstein said a person who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new but knows what I'd wondered what it would be like to be on this side now I'd be surprised if you weren't already subscribed to these guys but if you're not go click on these annotations and check out their channels and you may just learn something I'd also like to thank professor John Sperry from the University of Utah he walked me through all of this in an hour-long Skype conversation so I'm gonna put a link to his website in the description we're looking at pressures here below atmospheric is that right that's right this is a liquid pressure gas pressure so it's a common misconception that oh you can't have you know negative pressures because there's no molecules left you know the definition of pure vacuum is zero molecules that's for a gas okay so just just to be clear I think this was one of my big big problems in understanding this this video would have been impossible without CGP grey when I told him about this idea in London and I felt like mine just blown with this whole thing he said it was gonna be really hard to explain and you know when he says it's hard to explain you know things are gonna be tough so thank you for all your input to this script and thank you for watching making this video has been a real Odyssey for me so thank you for joining me on that journey I really appreciate all of your comments and if you haven't subscribed to the channel already you can click the annotation or click the link above and join me on my next scientific adventure I made a video promising to make a video about the answer to this I proposed the problem like right a couple months ago and I was like subscribe to the channel I'll give you the answer next week drive it at the write through code Z","Hx9TwM4Pmhc":"this is a water jetpack but no that's not me flying it this is me it's harder than it looks okay but to understand how it works we need to first talk rocket science rocket science is meant to be one of the most complicated things in the world but the basic principle is incredibly simple it's just Newton's third law all forces come in pairs which are equal and opposite to demonstrate this I'm using a fire extinguisher on a skateboard as the carbon dioxide is forced at the back of the extinguisher it puts a force forwards on me causing me to accelerate or that's the theory anyway if you look closely you can spot the exact moment I realize this is a fail so what was the problem here well the force applied to me by the carbon dioxide is equal to the rate of mass ejected out the back of the fire extinguisher call it m dot for short multiplied by the velocity of that exhaust gas so in this case the carbon dioxide wasn't ejected fast enough to create a big enough force and overcome the small frictional forces to get me to accelerate but it can be done as has been demonstrated many times on YouTube when the Space Shuttle lifts off exhaust gases exit the nozzle at three to four kilometers per second ejecting an amount of mass of nine thousand kilograms per second this creates thrust equal to thirty million Newton's or the equivalent of about two million decent fire extinguishers now imagine you're an astronaut preparing for launch in the Space Shuttle you would be seated not vertically but horizontally perpendicular to the acceleration that's because the human body is a little bit like a water balloon where the water represents your blood and the balloon represents your harder parts like your skeleton now if you're accelerated up really quickly then your skeleton accelerates up at that rate but your blood tends to stay where it is and this results in the blood ending up in your feet now since there's not enough oxygen going to your brain you would black out but fighter pilots face an arguably worse fate when they accelerate down too fast because then the blood all rushes to their head and they suffer something called a readout where the blood actually comes out of their eyes nose mouth and ears but back to astronauts since you're reclined at worst the blood will end up in the back of your body and the back of your head but your brain will still have enough oxygen to remain conscious now as the spacecraft lifts off and start speeding up the acceleration is initially a very reasonable five to eight meters per second squared that's less acceleration than an object in freefall here at the surface of Earth but as the spacecraft continues to burn fuel its mass decreases while the thrust remains essentially constant now Newton's second law says that the acceleration of an object equals the net force applied to it divided by its mass so as the mass decreases the acceleration increases and it increases at an increasing rate so much so that at the end of the rocket burn the thrust has to actually be limited in order to keep the acceleration from going over three g's that's three times the acceleration due to gravity or about 30 meters per second squared now the term g-force has been invented to give a sense of the amount of force experienced by astronauts in multiples of the force we experience every day right now you're experiencing one g-force probably on your butt if you're sitting down can you feel that force but accelerating at 3 G's you would experience 3 g-forces so the force between your back and the chair would be the same as if you had two of you stacked on top of you oh oh they type down below huh oh you guys are heavy oh man you know that feeling when you're taking off in a plane and it feels like you're pressed into the seat well really it's the seat pressing into you but if you imagine that feeling times 20 that's what it would be like to be taking off in the Space Shuttle now an interesting little side note is that we think of the space shuttles acceleration as being mainly vertical because that's what we see when it lifts off but that's actually not true once the Space Shuttle exits the thicker part of the atmosphere it turns horizontal and accelerates up to its orbital velocity of 28,000 kilometers per hour so most of the acceleration of a spacecraft in orbit anyway is horizontal so how is this like a jetpack well unlike the shuttle you don't carry your own propellant with you and also there's no chemical reaction releasing energy that drives the propellant down instead the jetski pumps water out of the lake and up that hose at a rate up to 60 liters per second and then right on these nozzles here the water changes direction so it goes from coming up to being fired at the bottom and that change in momentum as it goes over the bend is what actually pushes the jetpack up because the jetpack is pushing down on the water so by Newton's third law the water has to push up on the jetpack generating 1,800 newtons of thrust that's roughly equivalent to a hundred and fifty decent fire extinguishers this could accelerate me at up to 1.5 G's and you use your hands in order to steer lifting up to drive yourself upwards moving your hands down to accelerate forwards and pretend like you're turning a big wheel very gently in order to turn side to side one thing you don't want to do is try to explain the physics of the jetpack while in the air that's what I was trying to do here while you're learning your thrust is controlled by your instructor so if he sees you doing something stupid he'll just turn off the thrust and drop you into the lake so you don't hurt yourself that's generally a good idea unless you're on a collision course with the jetski I got a pretty fat lip from doing this but luckily all my teeth were intact when the thrust is equal to my weight plus the weight of water in the hose then I can hover or move with constant velocity it's a common misconception that you need a little bit of unbalanced force to move with a constant velocity in truth if the forces are balanced you will just continue moving with whatever constant velocity you have the other common misconception about Rockets is that you need something to push off like the atmosphere in reality what you're pushing off is the propellant so even without the air around a water jetpack would still work because you're pushing off the water that is coming out of those nozzles if you want to go jetpacking I recommend you go easy on the controls I mean the worst thing you can do is overcompensate which i think is a typical human reaction because you're reacting to where you are and how fast you're moving then you're not reacting to acceleration which is the real thing that you can control so even if you're coming down towards the water quite quickly you may be slowing down so it may be okay and you don't need to adjust anything you just kind of need to trust that the jetpack will get you out of any trouble it's a pretty incredible experience feeling the power that water rushing past you it's the closest I've gotten to flying really the power physics now many of you may not know that I have a second channel called to veritasium and I've been posting more videos on there recently so if you want

yeah it lights up the room it makes it not dark what's the difference between blue light red light the color it goes in your eyes and then you see stuff they range from white to red to orange to green it's like the chakras of your body can you see my aura no is it too bright oh it's very sunny out here today does that make it harder to see someone's aura necessarily if I was to explain it to a blind person it yeah it would be it would be the difference you see nothing whatsoever as a blind person whereas I see things in front of me to be fair the question of what light is is not an easy one for centuries the greatest minds and science debated this issue in the late 1600s Newton proposed that light was a stream of particles or corpuscles he proposed this in his treatise optics but at the same time a Dutch physicist named Huygens proposed that light was a wave and this debate raged on until it was settled by the experiment I've recreated today Thomas Young's double-slit experiment to make sure I got the experiment right I went to the original source with the help of Brady Haran I managed to get into the vault underneath the Royal Society in London there I found Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803 I brought into the Sunbeam s card about one thirtieth of an inch read and observed its shadow either on the wall or on other cards held at different distances besides the fringes of colours on each side of the shadow the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes smaller dimension this is an experiment so simple that you could make it at home and yet so fiddly that I have never seen it before done with sunlight I was thinking about doing it in a box like a like a fridge box you could take it out of this we're taking it out on the street I possibly interview you guys for about a minute we're doing a science experiment I have here is an empty box and this is a little eyepiece where we can look in and this is a hole and I'm gonna place this slide above that hole and if you look closely you'll see that there's two openings very narrow opening side by side it's a double slit now before we have a look we need to tilt it towards the Sun a little bit so we want the Sun to hit this double slit directly what are we gonna see on the bottom the obvious thing you think you're gonna see as you can see two two lines two lines on the bottom of the box two bright bands yeah I think it'll be one one lines of two I can expect to see the whole box lit up probably a kaleidoscope of some sort a bunch of colors probably gay rainbow different colors there have a look you expected to see kind of one line is that what you see no I see dogs how many it's one circle Oh years one there's one in the middle strongest to either side the two on the outside are multicolored and the one in the middle is just Wyatt I'm kind of a rainbow the rainbow of color as well quite a few colors and lots of little dots like there are more dots appearing I think I can even see more dots spreading along yeah that's amazing yeah I can see tons of darts no not tons but I can see dots but Erding yeah definitely yeah that's incredible and that's just nothing else apart from two slits to slit that's incredible but all we're doing is we're putting a light through to very narrow slits side by side how does this make any sense there's some kind of principle involved that the average person is not familiar with it's the only explanation now I'm really confused by it but I like to find out why people were debating is light or wave or is it made of particles so what causes that well if light were behaving as particles you would expect them to go through each slit and just produce a bright spot underneath so we would see two bright spots on the bottom of the box but if lights behaving as waves then the wave from one slit can interact with the waves from the other slit I've got a demonstration here on a little pond where we can see this with water waves I have two sources of ripples which are basically like the two slits when I create ripples with a single source they travel out with circular wave fronts nothing particularly surprising there but if I add a second source of ripples then we start getting an interesting pattern [Music] this pattern is created by the ripples from the two sources interacting with each other where they meet up Peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs the amplitude of the wave is increased that's what we call constructive interference but if the peak from one wave meets up with the trough from the other then we get destructive interference and there's basically no wave there and this is exactly what was happening with the light when the light from one slit met up peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs they'd constructively interfered and produced a bright spot but if the trough from the wave from one slit met up with the peak of the wave from the other slit they would destructively interfere and you wouldn't see any light there it's light canceling itself out this is basically the same is like having two drops of water fall in a swimming pool that's right exactly the same overlap as this ripple over overlap sa-do's ripples and down the bottom you get a series of you get like a bright spot and then a dark spot and a bright spot they have dark spot than a bright spot now there's a slight complication which is that sunlight is composed of many different colors and they have different wavelengths so obviously they're going to meet up at slightly different points and that's what caused the rainbow effects as we go further from the central maximum so you saw the ones to the right we're slightly colored yeah this type of sparking the reds are gonna meet up at different places than the blues and that's all that makes the color differences different wavelengths exactly that's amazing so the difference between the red been over there and the green the green part is just I'm seeing that it's just different winglet and that's how we bring in all these beautiful colors all around those exactly that's amazing I'm amazed thank you you now you may have noticed in that experiment that the light on the bottom of the box was not in the shape of slits rather they were more kind of round blobs and I want to know why that is can you write an answer for me in the comment section and I'll give you a hint one of the videos I've linked kind of is suggestive of the answer so convincing were the results of Young's double slit experiment that the scientific community concluded that light must be a wave there is no way it could be a particle","cY_o4A1wzsg":"hey youtube you said you wanted to talk what's up why do you go around making other people look stupid what do you mean what's water made of yeah what makes water okay what elements does it take to make water h2o so what does that mean it is water okay okay so that was one example really the cover dog side you know everything emits carbon dioxide in the trees human beings I guess like animals and trees are contributing to the are definitely but it's definitely so yeah so what trees are I guess the you know want the one of the original primary sources of for emitters of co2 so trees you know trees are just like anything else in on this earth that emits us Comeau dioxide I could do this all day you know you know you know what I think I think you do it to make yourself look superior oh yeah maybe that's it maybe I'm just a giant egotistical jerk who delights and humiliating other people well that fact certainly hasn't gone unnoticed by your viewers you come across a little condescending in these interviews you basically set up every single question to make other people look like idiots this guy is a pretentious douchebag now that's hurtful I hate this YouTube channel it makes every single person that interviews look like a complete  not everyone's a physicist so get the over stop alright my viewers don't own me actually you should have read those T's and C's a little more carefully by seeing your ads your viewers do in fact own you oh man yeah now come on just between you and me how closely do you have to pick through those interviews to make people look that dumb I mean some of them if you want to see the complete interviews then why don't you click the annotation you can judge for yourself did you ever think that the reason that I start with the misconceptions is because I wrote my PhD on how to design films to teach physics and I found that if you just say the correct stuff trees get most of their mass from carbon dioxide yep pretty much covers it viewers don't actually learn anything they just feel like they're learning and become more confident in the things that they thought beforehand so what you're saying is you make people look stupid so that you can teach others how noble but that's just if I don't think these people are stupid there's a difference between being unknowledgeable and being unintelligent i mean i i'm unknowledgeable about lots of stuff and science can be hard for the particular reason that it's counterintuitive so I think we should acknowledge what everyone's thinking what most people are thinking and use that as our basis for teaching but if you actually believe that why does your face light up with glee every time you hear a misconception because in that moment I realize that I can be useful I can help people learn the truth and that's the point of veritasium to help people understand the truth of the natural world and to get them to seek the truth in their own lives as Richard Fineman said the first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool this guy is a pretentious douchebag","HUmZrtiXDik":"[Applause] [Music] Nadja can you get me another coke no I'm good things it's just downstairs now the Tennessee's home you come to my house to watch the tennis and y'all even gonna get me another coat yeah it's the tiebreaker no that's you know I wish we had like a really long straw so we don't have to go downstairs the kitchen that we just stood Yeah right how long have a straw could we actually make that you could use mmm Dan's days would be a bit of a stretch I reckon yeah yeah don't think we could throw ants is that like three or four minutes yeah we could do it you need a lot of strolls though I got a pack here oh okay now our first test just to see that Nigel can use a straw properly we've got about a 1 meter length of straw here you think you didn't suck through that yeah let's go so we just take these drinking straws to get along and hopefully yeah that's all right well yeah coming through here from the joins in the straw zone we've got to come up with some better way to test this out I happen to have six meters of plastic tubing --here non-toxic that's what they said the hardware store all right we're preparing the preliminary test Nigel was lowering some tubing off the balcony he actually thinks he's got a shot at sucking through six meters worth of tubing I think he's got no chance and it's gonna be nowhere close but this will hopefully allow us to establish how much Nigel actually sucks he's getting ready up there he knows there's a lot riding on it when you ready whoa look at that look at that oh he shoots up he's got two meters he's got three meters look at that guy go he's getting four meters four meters five five meters six yeah I'm gonna try to be the same thing but the tube I'm using has a thicker diameter mine is about 5 mil whereas Nigel's was 3 males so we're gonna see if this makes any difference [Music] now I guess the obvious question is can Nigel do it not don't think that's the obvious answer but I'm pretty sure he's gonna fail but maybe what we're talking about is how strong works in the first place how does it work yeah because this is really just a big bendy straw if we look at a smaller version of a straw yeah we should all be familiar with how this works so should we I don't know I think most people just think you were sucking the liquid in and swallowing it but you kinda have to think about air pressure yeah because what is actually happening is that air pressure is what's causing the coke in this case to go up the straw well there's a difference in pressure between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure that you create by opening up your lungs and pulling your diaphragm down do you reduce the pressure in your mouth and it's that difference in pressure between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside you which gets that liquid flowing into you I feel like I don't and like someone has failed at the five millimeter diameter and then you're the next guy to take it on are you ready for this I am ready he's practicing his whole life yeah you can see it's a strong start go outside with Kwan we've got it all he's he's going big right there you can see there's a lot of determination getting close Oh disgusting I definitely felt like my tongue while I was trying to suck it up was being pulled out into into the straw I brought the same there but and it was tough on definitely tougher well done sir thank you means well for his next challenge we're going to try to get him to suck through ten point three meters which is the theoretical maximum size of straw how are you feeling well that theoretical maximum kind of relies on being able to get a perfect vacuum in although I am perfect in a lot of ways I don't know that I can create a perfect vacuum I've often thought that there's actually a perfect vacuum inside Nigel's head today we're gonna really find out won't we yeah okay we've got the setup here we're down up to Tamra I'm a beach and we have ten and a half meters worth of tubing which goes all the way up to Nigel at the very top there so we're gonna see if I can relive some of my former glory and get the red liquid up this heights three two one there you have Nigel is starting to suck on that straw there it goes looking strong create that vacuum approaching the edge of the cliff they're gonna I don't go come on Nigel doesn't seem to be going anywhere we seem a bit stuck on that point right there you can see the determination the focus trying to see how high that is he's done well but it just doesn't look like it's gonna happen [Music] all right so Nigel did pretty well there we saw that he could get the liquid up that tube about seven meters not the theoretical maximum of ten meters still more than you that's a good point that's a good point if Nigel could have created a perfect vacuum then the water would have gone up to ten point three meters by our calculations this is kind of similar to how they used to measure atmospheric pressure in the old days by millimeters of mercury so I'm aspheric pressure would push mercury up a tube with a vacuum at the other end 760 millimeters 760 millimeters so about 0.76 of a meter so you can see why they would have used mercury and not water because if you were doing this with water you'd need a cliff yeah you need a 10 meter long barometer so yeah much better to do it with millimeters of mercury and of course nowadays we measure it in kiloPascals anyway well done Nigel you really suck so how do we work out the maximum length of straw that you could suck through vertically well think about this you place the straw into the liquid and you start sucking from the top that decreases the pressure at the top and the difference in pressure between your mouth and atmospheric pressure creates a force that pushes the liquid upwards now that liquid which is in the straw has a weight which is equal to the volume of the liquid times its density times the gravitational field strength so if we set these two forces equal to each other you see that the pressure difference must be equal to the density of fluid times its height times the gravitational field strength and if we sub in the numbers we find that the maximum height of liquid that anyone could theoretically lift even if they created a perfect vacuum inside their mouth would be about ten point three meters","aFO4PBolwFg":"Shh I've snuck into minutephysics studio to explain how a wing actually works hang on mmm something doesn't feel right ah that's better now everyone knows that a wing generates lift due to its characteristic shape since air travels farther over the top of the wing it must go faster than the air underneath so that both streams meet up simultaneously at the trailing edge and according to Bernoulli's principle faster flowing air exerts less pressure than the slower air beneath the wing this pressure difference creates an upward force lift job done right nope this simple explanation taught in many textbooks and classrooms has obvious problems like how could a plane fly upside down some planes like the Wright brothers had nearly flat wings so presumably air would travel the same speed over both sides and there would be no lift Plus experiments show that air streams don't meet up at the back of the wing air over the top goes significantly faster reaching the trailing edge first so how does a wing actually generate lift well the key is the wing must deflect air downwards this can be achieved using a symmetric or cambered airfoil or by increasing the angle of attack air under the wing is deflected down and by the co and ax affect air above the wing is guided along its surface and down as well since the air is slowed and deflected down by the wing it pushes the wing up and back lift and drag this is in accordance with Newton's third law of motion but hang on if you can explain lift only using the deflection of air and Newton's laws then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely wrong well no air over the top of the wing does go faster than air beneath creating a pressure difference that generates lift then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary rubbish and the original explanation was right but that's not true either the original explanation incorrectly assumed that air over and under the wing must reconnect at the trailing edge and there was no mention of deflecting air down each explanation done correctly completely accounts for the lift generated by a wing they're just two different ways of looking at the same thing so next time someone brings up the standard misconception you can tell them that one nation just doesn't fly and if you like that you've got to check out minutephysics I have total respect for a guy who does this every week sincerely a collection of particles known as Derrick you you","PifL8bAybyc":"[Music] picture this you were thrown into a dinky room and told you can't leave until you have created the thinnest material known to man not only that it must also be the strongest the best thermal conductor and is good at conducting electricity as copper I know it sounds hopeless but luckily you know something about nanotechnology you know really really tiny devices and materials that are less than a hundred nanometers in size of course I don't have to tell you a nanometer is a billionth of a meter that's roughly the size of 10 atoms but how do you create something that tiny it's time to embrace your inner MacGyver you're gonna need a pencil some scotch tape and a healthy dose of elbow grease a pencil contains not lead but graphite which consists of sheets of carbon in a hexagonal lattice when you write layers of graphite slide off the tip of the pencil and stick to the paper usually many layers are stacked on top of each other but once in a while you get a single layer of carbon atoms and this is called graphene in 2004 andre game and konstantin novoselov created graphene using nothing but graphite and scotch tape they placed a graphite flake onto the tape folded it in two and then cleaved the flake in half they repeated this procedure a number of times and then studied the resulting fragments to their astonishment they found some of the pieces were only a single atom thick this was particularly unexpected because it was thought a single layer of graphite would not be chemically stable especially at room temperature graphene conducts electrons faster than any other substance at room temperature this is because of the extraordinarily high quality of the graphene lattice scientists are yet to find a single atom out of place in graphene since the electrons aren't scattered by defects in the lattice they go so fast that Einstein's relativity must be used to understand their motion and this perfect lattice is created by the very strong yet flexible bonds between carbon atoms making the substance bendable but harder than diamond graphene is incredibly strong if you could balance an elephant on a pencil and support the pencil on graphene the graphene wouldn't break of course the pencil would for their discovery game and Nova sell-off were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 and this is only the beginning for graphene scientists are hard at work exploiting its unique properties to create thin transparent flexible touchscreens smaller faster more energy efficient computers tough composite materials and more efficient solar cells and now consider this is only one aspect of nanotechnology so in order to think big you need first consider the very small you","KzOkuGQC3Rw":"want to spoil your girlfriend with diamonds while impressing her with your scientific knowledge here's how baby we've been together a long time and I've picked up on your hints I know that you want a diamond but I was thinking you're too special to me for just one diamond I want to give you one and a half million diamonds per second and not only that they're nano diamonds really yeah isn't that great nano diamonds you are a so now is the perfect time to tell her that scientists have recently discovered nano diamonds in the flames of ordinary candles millions of them as the hydrocarbon wax is burned diamonds form in the middle of the flame what did the exact same as regular diamond just really really small you always told me size doesn't matter are you packing I should put this into my thumb actually as it turns out the Nano diamonds are burnt up in the flame and released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide so you're probably better off getting a big diamond otherwise your relationship like the nano diamonds will go up in smoke you","1TKSfAkWWN0":"only a few elements can be permanent magnets iron is one copper is not but if you pass an electric current through any metal it becomes a magnet an electromagnet but how does this work well strangely enough it's a consequence of special relativity special relativity is the fact that in our universe length and time aren't absolute they're perceived differently by observers moving relative to each other hence relativity for example if you measure carefully enough you'll find that time passes slower for observers moving relative to you hey Derek when did you last shave six hours ago actually it was 5 hours 59 minutes and 59 point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine nine seconds and moving objects are also contracted in their direction of motion you're looking slim only in your frame of reference so when an object is moving relative to you it actually takes up less space than when it's not moving and even though this effect is obviously way tinier than we've shown length contraction is what makes an electromagnet work picture a copper wire it consists of positive metal ions swimming in a sea of free negative electrons now the number of protons is equal to the number of negative electrons so overall the wire is neutral so if there were a positive charge positively charged cat nearby it would experience no force from the wire at all and even if there were a current in the wire the electrons would just be drifting in one direction but the density of positive and negative charges would still be the same and so the wire would be neutral so no force on the kitty but what if the cat starts moving imagine for simplicity that the cat is moving in the same direction as the electrons with the same velocity well now in my frame of reference the wire is still neutral and so there should be no force on the cat but consider the same situation in her frame of reference in the cat's frame of reference the positive charges in the wire are moving so according to special relativity their separation will be ever so slightly contracted also from this perspective the electrons aren't moving so they'll be more spread out than before remember objects take up more space when they're not moving than when they are these two changes together mean there's a higher density of positive charges in the wire so it's no longer neutral it's positively charged which means that the positively charged cat will feel a repulsive electric force from the wire but in my frame of reference this seems mysterious there's no force on a stationary charged cat but a moving cat is somehow repelled from this neutral wire how do you account for that force well we say it is the magnetic force and that's mainly because a wire with current in it deflects nearby magnets so really what this experiment shows is that a magnetic field is just an electric field viewed from a different frame of reference in the cat's frame of reference it is repelled from the wire due to the electric field created by the excess positive charges produced by the effects of length contraction in my frame of reference the cat is repelled from a neutral wire due to the magnetic field created by the current flowing in the wire so whether you see it as an electric or a magnetic field just depends on your frame of reference but in either case the results are the same so an electromagnet is an everyday example of special relativity in action now that might seem crazy since electrons drift through wires at about point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one percent the speed of light so how can special relativity have anything to do with it well the truth is there are enough electrons in a wire and the electric interaction is so amazingly strong that even the miniscule effects of length contraction can produce significant charge imbalances that produce a noticeable force so special relativity explains electromagnets but what about permanent magnets yeah I mean there can't be electrical currents flowing around inside lumps of rock can there click here to go to MIT physics where we'll explore magnetite compasses and all the wizardry of permanent magnets you","F69uqDIhr60":"here are some facts about great white sharks white sharks are live birth usually in litters of between four and seven individuals now they're called pups but when they're born they're between 1.2 and 1.5 meters so that's a pretty big baby it takes a great white shark about 10 to 12 years to reach maturity at which point the females are actually about a metre longer than the males the largest recorded being over 6 meters roughly the size of this rent boat binds at this length they'd weigh about 2 to 3,000 kilograms oh man now there are stories of some great whites being over 7 meters but those are unsubstantiated white sharks are warm bodies they're not warm-blooded like us they can't maintain a perfectly stable temperature but their internal organs are kept at up to 13 degrees above the average temperature of the ambient water around them the heat generated by their muscles is actually transferred to the blood in their veins as it returns from the Sharks extremities so it warms it up and keeps the core temperature a little bit hotter this allows the shark to venture into colder waters and also to have explosive power its muscles work a lot better when warm than when cold just like ours the trade-off is the shark requires about 10 times as much energy as if it didn't heat its body and that's why they need to feed on these blubber rich seals and whale carcasses white sharks like to hunt when it's light out because they use their eyesight to spot their prey but when they open their jaws their eyes actually roll back into their head to protect them and so they're actually blind when they're taking a bite now they do like conditions that are a little bit low visibility because they rely on stealth to track down their prey if a seal spots them coming it's basically game over because the seal is so much more maneuverable and can definitely get away from the shark but they only eat sea mammals after they're about 2.5 meters long which is why most of the Sharks we're seeing around here are quite large before that they're died consists mainly of fish the gestation period is thought to be about 18 months and that leads to a two to three year reproduction cycle and with such small litters that means it takes a long time for this shark population to recover there are a couple of misconceptions about great white sharks one is that they can't get cancer and that's led to a lot of people hunting them down and trying to use their fins as an anti-cancer soup but in reality sharks get cancer just like anything else and there's photographic evidence of sharks with big tumors so it makes no sense to hunt down sharks as a cancer remedy because they get cancer just like we do another misconception is sharks are coastal creatures that just cruise the beaches waiting to bite people in reality the Sharks spend much of their time way away out at sea and very deep over a kilometer deep it's kind of shocking but we've only found this out in the last couple of years so there's so much about sharks that remains undiscovered we don't know where they go or what they do for most of the time that they're alive and that's why research projects like this are so important to find out more about the shark and figure out how we can help it rehabilitate and and become the predator of the sea that it once was you","sMb00lz-IfE":"[Applause] what will happen tomorrow is not random in other words it's at least somewhat predictable I mean not entirely to be sure but some things will happen for certain and other things definitely won't for example the Sun will rise water will still freeze at zero degrees Celsius and you won't become Michael Stevens we know this because everything in the universe is made of twelve fundamental particles and they interact in four predictable ways what if I were able to determine the positions and velocities of every single one of these particles in the universe well you would be the intelligence envisioned by Laplace who thought if you could really figure out where everything is and how fast it's moving you would know the entire future of the universe because you know how every particle interacts with every other particle Wow so nothing would be unpredictable which means nothing would be random not even human behavior since we are made of the same fundamental particles as everything in the rest of the universe everything we will ever do or have ever done would be determined by the information in the state of the universe at any one time but what is information well it seems to be fundamentally about order the order of molecules in your DNA contained the information needed to make you it is the order of zeros and ones streaming through the internet that contain all the information required to play this video it is the order of letters that makes a word on the order of words that makes a sentence that carries information so fundamentally information seems to be about order regularity that is until you really think about it I mean does every letter of a word carry the same amount of information no I mean after a cue you know almost for certain that the next letter will be a u after a th there will probably be an e so these letters carry very little information because you could predict them beforehand they are redundant in fact the founder of information theory Claude Shannon estimated the redundancy of English at about 75% which is why we can make sense of things like this so English can be compressed because it is not random it has patterns similarly video is compressible because of its regularities in each frame the pixels of similar color cluster together Plus from frame to frame most of the pixels don't change so you only need to record the ones that do change you can take advantage of this technique to create some trippy effects known as data moshing it's the application of the movement data from one video to the pixels of another it also means that an average video can be compressed to just one thousandth of its original size but what is the most you can't compress something well anything that is not random any patterns or regularities can be reduced because they are predictable so you can continue shrinking a file down until what you're left with is totally random and that will contain all of the information of the original item but distilled pure information so pure information is randomness if you want to know how much information something contains you need to know how random it is and randomness is disorder what we also call entropy so information fundamentally is entropy this makes sense if you consider a string of binary digits for example this string is perfectly ordered it has very low entropy and it contains no information that's the state of an erased hard drive now this string contains slightly more information but again the regularities allow it to be easily compressed so the string that contains the maximum amount of information is just a random set of zeros and ones it has maximum entropy because it's totally disordered you could not predict any of those digits by looking at any of the other digits and if you wanted to send this information to someone you would have no other option but to send the whole string of digits there's no way to compress it but here's the thing about any object that contains maximum information us as human beings they carry no meaning for example a video containing maximum information we look like this it is just white noise the color of each pixel is independent of all the other pixels and they all change randomly this video could not be compressed because it's already totally random now a random sequence of DNA would not make an organism and a random string of letters does not generally make a word we are drawn to things that are neither perfectly ordered containing no information nor are they perfectly disordered containing maximum information somewhere in the middle we can recognize complex patterns and that is where we derive meaning in music poetry and ideas it is this search for meaning that leads us to propose scientific theories which if you think about it are really our way of compressing the universe for example general relativity our current theory of gravity compresses into one short equation everything from how an Apple falls to the earth to have a moon orbits the earth and all the planets orbit the Sun how the Sun orbits a supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy how black holes form and behave and how the whole universe expands out from the Big Bang now that we have this theory the future is more predictable I mean we can predict eclipses thousands of years into the future so with all of our scientific theories does that mean that the universe is completely not random that it is perfectly predictable well let's assume for a second that Laplace was right and that knowing the state of the universe at any one time means you also know its state at every other time as well well that would mean that the information in our universe would be constant but if information is entropy that would mean the entropy of the universe is also constant and that does not appear to be the universe that we live in the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy in the universe increases with time or in other words things don't stir themselves apart but if entropy is going up that the information in our universe is constantly increasing that makes sense because it would take more information to specify the state of the universe now then right after the Big Bang so where is this new information coming from my best bet is quantum mechanics quantum mechanics describes how the twelve fundamental particles behave and as spectacularly successful as it is it is only a probabilistic theory meaning that you cannot predict with absolute certainty where an electrons say will be at some later time you can only calculate probabilities of where you are likely to find it so when you do interact with it and locate the electron at a particular point you have gained information you now know something that you couldn't have predicted with certainty beforehand this drove Einstein crazy he said God does not play dice referring to this I mean he wished that we could compress our theory of quantum mechanics further so that we could really figure out where these particles were going to be but maybe the reason why we haven't been able to compress quantum mechanics further is because fundamentally it's random fundamentally new information is being generated every time a quantum event like that occurs in that case it could be these quantum measurements which are driving up the entropy of the universe they are creating new information all of the time and that means the disorder in our universe must go up this is what we observe as the second law of thermodynamics you know we often think about the second law as a curse as though everything which is ordered is going towards disorder but maybe I mean it's only in a universe where this law is obeyed that the truly unexpected can occur that the future can be actually undetermined for us really to have free will we need the second law of thermodynamics now you might think that these quantum events are too small to have any meaningful impact on the evolution of the universe but that is not true and that's because there are physical systems which are so dependent so sensitive to the initial conditions that any tiny change will end up making a big difference later down the track that's called chaos but it's also known as the butterfly effect so you and I could be such physical systems chaotic systems and our free will could come from quantum events in our brains so it looks as though we live in a universe where the future is yet to be determined that is to say it's at least somewhat random but Derek what is the most random thing possible in the universe you know it's such a good question I'm talking about it over on Vsauce you want to go find out about randomness with me let's go check it out all right and you can decide whether to click over or not oh that's nice [Music] [Applause] [Music]","SQggDnScsvI":"there is a misconception about chameleons that they change their color in order to blend in with their environment that is actually not the case when a chameleon is calm it is green and so it naturally blends in with its leafy surroundings but male chameleons change color when they become excited in the presence of a female or a rival male as shown here I'll put the first frame in the bottom right for comparison as you can see as he becomes more excited his color changes to be more yellow orange and red so instead of blending in this chameleon will now stand out but how do chameleons actually change their color for years we thought that there was a simple well-established mechanism for this color change in their skin chameleons have different cells containing colored pigments some are yellow others are red and some contain the dark melanin pigment many animals including chameleons are known to turn a darker shade by causing the melanin to spread out along the fingery extensions of the cell they turn lighter again by condensing the pigment back into one spot it was assumed that chameleons must turn yellow orange and red in the same way by causing those pigments to spread out in those cells but new research from collaborating groups of physicists and biologists at the University of Geneva shows that this is incorrect now the first clue should come from the fact that there is actually no green pigment in a chameleon the green color is actually created by two distinct mechanisms pigment color and structural color beneath the yellow pigment cells there are cells containing tiny 130 nanometer crystals regularly arranged in a lattice now light diffracts off these crystals and due to the spacing between them blue light constructively interferes and is therefore strongly reflected whereas the other colors are not reflected this is very similar to how a Morpho butterfly wing creates an iridescent blue there is no blue pigment just the periodic nanoscale structure that acts as a strong reflector for only one color so a chameleon looks green due to the combination of the yellow light from the pigment plus the blue light reflected off the crystal structure beneath it so how do chameleons change this green into yellow orange and red well previously it was assumed that the color change was achieved by dispersing pigments in the colored cells but now scientists have found it's actually the crystals underneath which are changing by increasing the spacing between the crystals the chameleons can change which color is selectively reflected bigger gaps between the crystals are better at reflecting longer wavelengths so as the spacing increases the color changes from blue to green to yellow and then orange in red scientists compared skin samples from calm green chameleons and excited yellow chameleons and found that indeed in the excited chameleons the crystal spacing was much further apart here you can see a single-cell enlarged and the color it reflects changing from blue to green to yellow orange and red plus a computer simulation of the light reflected off crystals while their spacing is decreasing also provides excellent agreement with these observations furthermore applying physical pressure to the skin causes the crystals to compress and so they reflect more blue light when that pressure is removed the crystals expand again reflecting more green light the structure of a chameleons skin gets even more fascinating as there's another layer of cells underneath which also contain crystals but these crystals are larger more spaced out and more disorganized this means they reflect longer wavelengths in the infrared part of the spectrum and they reflect a broader range of these wavelengths it's thought that the function of this layer could be to reflect heat from the Sun since these chameleons live in bright full Sun habitats so male chameleons don't change their color hue by spreading out red and yellow pigments instead they do something much more remarkable they actively tune the spacing between nanoscale crystals in order to create structural colors that span the whole length of the visible spectrum now what I find amazing is that in this day and age we thought we had the answer to how chameleons change color but it actually took the combined expertise of physicists and by just working together to figure out what's really going on this episode of veritasium was supported by lynda.com a leading online learning platform with over 3,000 video courses

laws of motion that govern how everything moves. There are three pretty famous laws of motion. And they're not very complicated, but if I told them to you as clearly as I can, You would think that you're understanding them, but I think you wouldn't. And the reason is, everyone has ideas about physics and how objects move, Before they're ever taught anything in, uh, a science classroom. So rather than tell you Newton's Three Laws of Motion, I like to tell you Derek's Three Incorrect Laws of Motion, which are the ones I think you're actually thinking. So, Derek's First Incorrect Law of Motion is... An object with no unbalanced forces on it will naturally come to rest. [Cup sliding] [Books falling] [Door slamming] [Coin spinning and falling] Derek's Second Incorrect Law of Motion is that an unbalanced force causes An object to move with a constant velocity We could express this in an equation. Where the unbalanced force, F, equals the mass (M) times the velocity (V) So, if you double the force, the velocity also doubles. It's just like being in a car. As you press on the accelerator, you increase the force on the car, and therefore, you move to a new, higher constant speed. Derek's Third Incorrect Law of Motion is that Larger objects apply larger forces to smaller objects. When a large truck slams into a car on the highway, The force of the truck on the car is much greater than the force of the car back on the truck. Or you think about the Earth and the Moon. The force with which the Earth attracts the Moon is greater than the force with which the Moon attracts the Earth. But remember, this is an incorrect law of motion.","_Z0X0yE8Ioc":"*steps*   What is the difference between mass and weight? I think it's\nsomething that a lot of people are confused about. They just think that anything that's big\nlike this car has a lot of weight, is very heavy it's gotta lot of mass and people just\nbasically think of these ideas as all the same. But there's an important\ndistinction between the terms mass and weight. Mass at first is the amount of matter in an object whereas weight is a\nforce. It's the gravitational attraction that\nthe object feels towards in this case the Earth's center. So\ngot a little experiment today where I brought my car at here and ask some people. Why is it difficult to push my car? And my bet is the answer will be because the car is heavy. (no duh) Because it's heavy. Because it's too heavy. (we get it, your car is heavy.) A big rock you would think would be heavy It's too heavy. It's been lighter than I thought. It is because its weight. Weight is responsible. What is weight? Weight is mass in a gravity. What it this gravity thing? Gravity is what keeps ... *talking indecisively* Your car is pulled towards at the center of the earth yes. But now when you push it, as in pushing your car, you are not pushing it up. Do you know what I mean? But it's still hard to push. Yeah So do you think weight is responsible for making it hard to push?   But I'm not trying\nto lift the car and I'm just trying to push it A big rock you would think would\nbe heavy. Anything that is big we think it would be heavy but I'm not\nlifting it on pushing so it's also gravity but this is my question right? but\nI'm not trying to lift it No, thats true. But it's\nstill hard to push. So why is that? because like if I\nlift it, I understand you are saying it's heavy and it'd be really hard but we're pushing it actually getting it to go So how does that work. \nThe answer is because the car has inertia. \nInertia means that objects with mass have a tendency to resist changes in their motion. And I thought\nshe had a great answer when I started which was inertia Can you tell us about that? What's inertia?\nIt's just like once something stops it doesn't really wanna go unless something is going. It doesn't mind and would stop. The idea that I'm trying to get\nis actually is that it's these are actually two different things. Right? One thing is that there's a force\npulling a stand into the earth and that's what we call weight and that\nmakes it impossible to lift but there's something else which is\ncalled inertia and that mean something is difficult to change its motion because got a lot of\ninertia and that's why it's difficult to push\nwhich is different than when it's difficult to lift. Which is the weight force pulling it down\ntowards here Fair enough but it's actually not as\ndifficult to push. It's not that hard yeah I know it doesn't prove my point (Subtitles by Jimena)","txmKr69jGBk":"Let's switch it on. Let's see what it does. Through this coil of thick wire, we're about\nto pass a huge alternating electric current. On top is a 1 kg aluminium plate. So we hear that noise. What's that noise? It's the vibration of the plate, because it's\nvibrating at two times the frequency of this one. Woah! Woooaaaahhhhhhh!! hahaha, how does it do that? It's magical To find out, I've come to the place where\nit all started - The Royal Institution in London This is the key to Faraday's magnetic lab. It's amazing that the lock still works. From the 1870's on this became a store room,\nwhich is why it survived and it survived intact, all the joinery giant electromagnet are exactly\nthe same as Faraday left it. So this is exactly as Faraday would have had\nit. That's right, yup. In Faraday's time it was known that electric\ncurrent creates a magnetic field, but it remained an open question whether the reverse is possible\n-- if a magnetic field could generate electric current. Faraday answered this question with his most\nfamous apparatus. Faraday's electromagnetic induction ring. Which is this. In August, 1831 Faraday wrapped two coils\nof insulated wire around this iron ring. But in 1831 you could not go down to your\nlocal electrical hardware shop and ask for x hundred meters of insulated wire, you had\nto insulate the wire as you went. So as you pushed and pulled the wire in and\nout of the ring you had to insulate it. It takes 10 working days, which was a huge\ninvestment of time. But the investment paid off. When Faraday connected a battery to one of\nthe coils, he saw a brief pulse of current in the other coil. And when he disconnected the battery, he saw\na pulse of current in the other direction. He realized that current was induced in the\nsecond coil only when the magnetic field through it was changing. And if they hadn't been wrapped on the same\nring, Faraday may have noticed that the two coils repel each other when the current is\ninduced and that's due to the interaction of their magnetic fields. Which brings us back to this. Through the bottom coil we are passing a huge\nelectric current: 800A which alternates in direction 900 times per second. This ensures there will always be a changing\nmagnetic field above the coil. Instead of a second coil we're using the Aluminium\nplate, but the principle is the same, the changing magnetic field induces currents in\nthe plate that create an opposing magnetic field -- so it levitates. How awesome is that?! This current is not only good for levitating\nthe plate. It can also make lightbulbs glow. A gift. Uh, thank you. Oh. That is cool. Not too close because it will burn the lamps. Can I put it there? Yeah. And just as current in a toaster element heats\nit up, the induced current in the plate dissipates its energy as heat. And some water too\nThank you. Yeah to see the temperature. Check out how hot this plate is. Oh, that is nuts! Is this your favorite demo? It's a flying BBQ or something Tell me this is not the best dinner table\ncenterpiece. It levitates, gives you light, and you can\ncook on it. and all the while you're demonstrating Faraday's Law of electromagnetic induction.","a7_8Gc_Llr8":"What is a candle flame really made of? I am at the Palace of Discovery in Paris to\ndo an experiment that beautifully demonstrates the answers. Ok so we're turning on an electric field here and we see that the flame is spreading out. Thats very cute, it's like a butterfly. And you can see that the flame has two separate pieces to it now. One is going towards the negative plate. Those would be the positive ions, and the negative ions will be going\ntowards a positively charged plate. So we see the flame kinda flattening out. But if that didn't convince you that flame contains ions, then check part two of our experiment where we compare the conductivity of a flame to the connectivity of air, which is normally a pretty good insulator. It requires about 10,000 volts to break down a centimeter of air. So right now this plate is is about 20,000 V. You see that the spark is only little, but if I put it around the flame, we will see if we can get a bigger spark happen. Look at that, yeaaa! Because the flame has those ions in it, that means that we can break down a greater distance of air. This greater conductivity. It's awesome!\nYou love doing this, right? A strong enough electric field can actually extinguish the flame but watch carefully what happens \nwhen the flame goes out. Just like in the flame, \nthe opposite charges in the smoke are pulled in opposite directions. Now while some may argue that a flame is not truly a plasma because it's not hot enough and it doesn't have a high enough density of ions, one thing is for sure, it does contain ions which have important electrical properties, which can be demonstrated if \nyou have a strong enough electric field.","rM04U5BO3Ug":"Boiling point is something that we normally think of as a stable property of a substance. But it really depends on what the pressure is around the substance, so, for example, water only boils at 100 degrees Celsius, if the pressure is 1 atmosphere. So if you reduce the pressure, then those water molecules that are going quite quickly can easily escape from the water if there's no pressure pushing down on them. So you can get water to boil at room temperature. This is really boiling water. The funny thing about boiling water at room temperature is that it actually decreases the temperature of the water. That's because all the fastest water molecules escape, leaving only the slow ones behind. We are refrigerating the water Refrigerating the water, by boiling it. Yes, yes (Laughing) That is a cool concept. I know everyone's a big fan of liquid nitrogen, but I've never seen solid nitrogen. So we used the same trick, pumping out the very fastest nitrogen molecules. And eventually, that decreased the temperature enough that the nitrogen actually froze. (Laughing) I'm putting a thermocouple in there so we can measure the temperature of our liquid nitrogen. And it reads... Okay, so the temperature of our liquid nitrogen is about minus 196 Celsius. Which is exactly what it should be. And now we're going to evacuate the chamber. We're gonna suck the air out of there. you can see that the nitrogen is boiling The temperature's dropping, minus 199, minus 200... We're coming up on the triple point of nitrogen. I don't know. We're forming solid nitrogen. The ice is actually getting sucked up by the reduced pressure up here, and there is a higher pressure underneath the ice because the vacuum pump hasn't had a chance to work there. I've never seen solid nitrogen before After creating the solid nitrogen, we poured it onto a water bath. and we got the whole surface so cold that carbon dioxide actually condensed out of the atmosphere, and we formed solid carbon dioxide, dry ice, on the surface of the water. we have a solid piece of CO2","gM3zP72-rJE":"I'm gonna try to demonstrate something called regelation. Which is where you provide a pressure onto ice and that turns it into water but after that pressure is removed it freezes again So, in order to demonstrate this I've taken apart the high E string from my guitar. I chose the E string because it's thinner than a G string and that's important. And I've weighted it with these two bottles of water. When I apply the string across the ice we should see the wire start to cut through the ice And perform the regelation of the ice. where we'll see if it works because we are outside in Sydney and it's warmer than 0\u00b0C obviously. All right, it's past 3 A.M. but the experiment has been a success I passed this wire through this giant block of ice And it 's still a solid block. You can actually see the point where the wire went through, here.   So, we pretty clearly demonstrated regelation. The idea that you can compress the ice, turn it into water and then when that pressure is gone it solidifies again as ice. Pretty cool stuff.","2xKZRpAsWL8":"so today and i'm at the University of Sydney with\nDoctor Phil Dooley and we're talking about how our idea of the atom changed from a tiny\nlittle hard sphere to something more complicated And this apparatus has something to do with that\nPhil: exactly, exactly it was quite a the landmark historical experiment it's just made of a tube of glass connected\nto a a vacuum pump and in the tube of glass there are two pieces\nof metal connected to high-voltage power supply so we can suck the air out of here\nPhil: that's right and then apply a high voltage two metal plates\nPhil: yes Normally with high voltage in air we don't get anything except\nmaybe a big spark but what we what Geissler found who did this\nin 1857 was something quite different so shall we have a look? Derek: let's do it\nPhil: ok, let's turn on the pump and the high volts turn off the lights so we can see what's going on as you can see something's happening now yes I see a bit of a pink glow in there.\nPhil: that's right so imagine Geissler, the first person to ever see this, it's pretty surprising that started people thinking 'what is the stuff\nthat's coming from the cathode?' There seems to be a ray emitted from this negatively charged\none which they called the cathode so therefore it's called a cathode ray and it became the topic for research for the next\nforty years since all the big big wigs of physics in science\nbasically tried to work at what was going on So what did they figure out? I mean what is\ngoing on? What's producing this glow here there were two main camps one thought that it was waves and the second thought that the electricity was\nbeing carried by a stream of charged particles. Over\nthe next forty years they basically came to the conclusion - well it was \nJJ Thomson in eigteen ninety seven who came up with the idea that uh... there\nis a stream of very small charged particles uh... negatively charged they're smaller than an atom so the smallest atom a hydrogen atom they're about one thousandth of the size of that and it doesn't matter what material it - the metal is it's always the same particle, so this\nparticle appears to be in everything and this electron as it was as\nknownn is what's carrying the electricity so Thomson came to the conclusion that all atoms have this particle as one of their\nconstituents that's right, that's right so it wasn't a billiard ball,\nthere had to be something inside the billiard ball so how do I picture like a billiard ball with bits inside it?\nPhil: Well you should probably think about a pudding A pudding?\nPhil: Yeah well that's what his idea was, that\nit was a plum pudding very dear to every British person's heart Derek: right \nPhil: and inside the putting you have plums and plums can come out of that so when you\napply high voltage then a negatively charged electron which thompson pictured as a plum comes out and\nleaves behind positively charged putting are you a fan of plum pudding?

I have made this video and Destin has made\na video on Smarter Every Day and we want you to play them both at the same time. So there\u2019s a link to his video down in the\ndescription so find a way to load both of these videos and then synchronize them on\nmy mark in 5 4 3 2 1 In Sydney, Australia we are at 34 degrees\nSouth Lattitude. Which is the opposite side of the world from\nHuntsville, Alabama. So, which way do the toilets flush? That is the question. The Simpsons did a whole episode based on\ntoilets flushing the opposite direction in Australia. Plus, other shows have supposedly demonstrated\nthis effect. So is this a real effect or not? \u201cThe application of this principle to water\ndraining in Earth's two hemispheres is just bunk.\u201d If you try it yourself, you\u2019ll find inconsistent\nresults. This sink sometimes drains one way and sometimes\nthe other way In any container of water there's always going\nto be some rotation. The water is not perfectly still. And it is this, rather than the hemisphere\nthat determines which way the water will swirl down the drain. But what if we could eliminate all motion\nfrom the water? I have here a five foot wide kiddy pool I actually filled the pool in the anticlockwise\ndirection to be sure any clockwise motion we see is not due to how I filled the pool. I\u2019ve left this water sitting here for 24\nhours. So it seems like I've damped all of the motion\nfrom the filling. I \nreally hope this works. Destin, wish me luck! I'm about to pull the plug 3... 2... 1... And the pool is draining, but you can't see\nany motion of the water just yet. To help us see where the water is flowing\nI'm going to put some food colouring in on the four cardinal directions around the pool. You can clearly see that the water is flowing\nclockwise, in this direction and that makes sense because that's how it should flow in\nthe southern hemisphere due to the Earth's rotation. But you can see what a tiny little effect\nit is and what extraordinary lengths I had to go to to see this effect. So really you're not going to see it in a\nbathtub or in a toilet or in a sink because there are other sources of angular momentum\nthat totally wash out this effect. The Coriolis effect. There you have it... It works! To understand how it works, imagine a pool\nwith one edge touching the south pole. The pool is stationary relative to Earth,\nbut every day it\u2019s actually completing one full revolution. You can see the side of the pool furthest\nfrom the pole travels much farther every day than the side right next to the pole. So the outer side of the pool is moving fastest\ntowards the East and as you get closer to the pole the velocity decreases down to zero. Now imagine we drain the pool. Water from the far side is moving too fast\nrelative to the drain and so it gets out ahead, whereas water from near the pole is going\ntoo slow and so it lags behind. So when the water approaches the drain, it\nswirls clockwise. And this is the reason cyclones swirl clockwise\nin the Southern hemisphere. The higher pressure air rushes into the eye\nof the storm and, just like in our pool, swirls in the direction dictated by the hemisphere\nAnd that\u2019s the truth about toilet swirl I definitely learned something and if you\ndid too then you should share these videos with your friends.

So we're calculating\npi using this, which is a target composed\nof a square and a circle inside the square\nthat has a diameter the same length as one\nside of the square. So the idea of\ncalculating pi like this is that the number of darts\nthat land in the circle divided by the number of darts\nthat land in the entire square should be proportional\nto the area of the circle divided by the\narea of the square. If the length of one\nside of the square is 1, that means the area\nof the square is 1. That means the radius\nof the circle is 1\/2. So the area of the circle is pi\nr squared, so it's pi over 4. Therefore, if we multiply the\nratio of the number of darts that land inside the circle\ndivided by the number of darts total by 4, we should get pi. DEREK MULLER: So how'd we do? We didn't do great. [MUSIC PLAYING] DEREK MULLER: We divide\ncircles by the total. DIANNA COWERN: 103. Total is 103. DEREK MULLER: Yeah. 88 by 103, and then\nwe multiply by 4. Yes. Ooh. DEREK MULLER: Is it bad? No, it's kind of funny. 3.41. [LAUGHTER] That is higher than pi. That suggests that\nwe're getting more of our random samples inside\nthe circle than we should. DEREK MULLER: I don't know. Randomness is a tough\nthing to see, right? DIANNA COWERN: I know. DEREK MULLER: Does\nthat look random to me? DIANNA COWERN: What\ndoesn't look random is this whole\nsection right here. DEREK MULLER: I do think these\nare centrally distributed, rather than evenly spread. So we gotta try something else. DEREK MULLER: Mm-hm. We could try a bigger one and\njust try to be more random. How do you try\nto be more random? We can throw a lot of darts\nin a short amount of time. The sun is setting. We really need to\nmake this happen. And if you'll let me, I'll\ndo my multi-dart spray. You can do your\nmulti-dart spray. You can do eight darts at once. Eight darts at once. DEREK MULLER: 3, 2, 1. DIANNA COWERN: Oh! [LAUGHTER] Four? [INAUDIBLE]. DEREK MULLER: Oh, I really\ndon't know about this. Why are you laughing so hard? DEREK MULLER: Because\nof how ridiculous it is. You don't even know\nhow ridiculous this is. Like that? DIANNA COWERN: Like this. How am I doing? Like that? DIANNA COWERN: Yeah. Well, how do you hold one dart? I don't know,\nbut this is crazy. Oh, yeah. DIANNA COWERN: Look at that.

Circles 2-- Here is the moment of truth. We have 146 in the circle\nover a total number of 179. DIANNA COWERN: Mm-hm. Then we're gonna multiple\nby 4, and we should see pi. 3.26! Oh, it's slightly better\nthan our estimates all day. I feel like there are\nbetter ways to measure pi than throwing darts at a board. Don't do this method, kids. I'm warning you. This is not a good idea. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HEAVY SIGH] So we're going to\nfind the accurate value of pi using darts today? I am so hopeful. New day, new game plan. I've drawn this\npattern for Dianna. But she doesn't know\nwhat it looks like. That is to avoid her trying\nto aim it at anything. So we're going to\nput this on the fence with it facing away from\nher, so she won't really know what she's trying to hit. I'm going to try to aim\nas randomly as I can all over this board. DEREK MULLER: All right. Not bad. Looks pretty random to me. DEREK MULLER: Well done. [MUSIC PLAYING] Why don't we rotate the\nfence 90 degrees this way? There's some sort of\nsystematic error in the way that we are throwing. OK. DEREK MULLER: This\nshould fix it, right? One. DIANNA COWERN: Oh, ho. I think this is\nactually easier to do. DEREK MULLER: So you want to\ntake the board off the fence and see how we did? We're taking it off. So my guess is it's right here. Ready? DEREK MULLER: Hang on. OK, go for it. Oh, ho, ho, ho! I like this. I like the grid. DEREK MULLER: I figured\nthis went with a strategy that we decided\nyesterday, where we wanted to have up and downs\nbe able to hit, like-- DIANNA COWERN: Yeah. DEREK MULLER: Plus we've got\na center one that is probably going to be very dense. And then we've got\nradially outer ones, which I thought would be less dense. 80. DIANNA COWERN: Uh-huh. DEREK MULLER: 85. DIANNA COWERN: Mm-hm. After trying so many\ndifferent methods, it's now after sunset on\nthe second day of trying to calculate pi with darts. DEREK MULLER: So what\nis our estimate of pi? DIANNA COWERN: 3.139. [LAUGHTER] 3.139. DEREK MULLER: (SHOUTING) Yeah! That is awesome. [LAUGHTER] Oh my gosh. Check that out. DEREK MULLER: How different\nis that from actual pi? What percentage error is that? Divide by pi. [LAUGHTER] 0.07%. Like 0.1%, if you\nround up, error.

I try to find the coolest\ndemos, the most amazing things around me. And I show those\noff on the channel. This is basically my\nfirst real YouTube video. I really cringe to watch this. -If you took a piece of matter\nlike this piece of aluminium foil, you could cut in\nhalf and in half again, each time reducing the\nnumber of atoms by half. The idea was you could not go\non doing that indefinitely, for there would come\na point when you have only a single atom left,\nand it is uncuttable. DEREK MULLER: I think if you're\nmaking videos about science, the easiest thing for\nyou to do is make science for people who are\nalready into science. I mean, my audience is\nbig time into science, and I love that these\npeople are just like me. But I feel like I should\nalso be reaching out to people who haven't had\nsuch a background in science or aren't interested in it. So I want to get back to\nthis kind of original mission at some point, and maybe\nstart another channel where I do actually do this, so anyone\nwith a very limited background in anything\nscientific could learn about everything\nin the universe. Thank you for watching. Science truly is the\nbest thing in the world. LIZZIE BASSETT:\nThank you, Derek, for helping my\ncreatively minded brain understand science for\nover four years now. So useful. And many thanks,\nVerizon, for helping us to sit down\nwith these creators and explore their choices. If you have a creator you're\ndying to get to know better, let us know in the comments\nwith the hashtag #MYFIRSTUPLOAD. Keep an eye out.

Michael here and Derek. Generate(!) 78? That's so random. Or is it? What does it mean to be random? Can anything really be random? \nWhat's the most random thing ever? Today let's stop being random and become 'ransmart'. If something is unpredictable, and contains no recognisable patterns, we\ncall it random. So let's begin our hunt for the most random thing with a coin toss. The Australian 50 cent coin is one of the largest coins currently in circulation. Coin flips and rolling dice are not\nintrinsically random, they are only random because of our ignorance. If we could know every initial condition the exact forces and properties that play\nfor a particular flip or roll, we could theoretically calculate the result before it even happened. And, sure enough, researchers\nhave built coin flipping robots that can precisely control a flip to get\nthe result they want 100 percent of the time. So here is our question. Is there anything you couldn't predict even if you knew everything? A process determined by nothing? And how can you be sure they're aren't any patterns in what you're\nlooking at? Maybe you just haven't looked for the right pattern yet. Or maybe you have already seen true\nrandomness but didn't know it because you didn't\nlook for long enough. As if protected by a sort of camouflage, a random process can, and will,\noccasionally produce patterns. YouTube URLs are pretty much random. A unique one is made for every\nuploaded video, but sometimes, like the proverbial monkeys typing away\non typewriters, YouTube generates a URL that contains, by chance, a word. The official music video for 50 Cent's 'In Da Club' contains a synonym for bottom. This video was assigned 'hello', there are some 'sexies' and a sauce. If you\nwant to find out if a particular word has been randomly assigned to a video\nyet, you can search for it by using this string in Google. The point is, randomness is difficult to identify.\nIt is easier to be certain that something is not random than that it is. But despite this elusiveness something interesting is going on right now. Increasingly, we, especially young people, are calling\nclearly predictable things random. Like randomly running into your best friend at a popular restaurant. Or hilariously bizarre combinations of things that we call totally random because they are\nseemingly unrelated, even though, of course, they were chosen\nnot in random but in a very determined way because they are all unrelated. Those guys that showed up at the party last night you didn't know, they weren't randos in a mathematical sense. They knew about the party, we're in\nthe mood to go to a party and we're in the area. Pretty predictable, actually. This non-statistical use of the word random annoys some people but it's not that far off\nfrom the original meaning of the word. In the 1300s, random meant running or at great speed. Later, it would be used to describe\nthings that have no definite purpose. It wasn't until the 1800s that random\ntook on a particular mathematical definition. Then in the 1970s, MIT's student paper popularised the use of the word random\nto simply mean strange. Of course, just because\nsomething is strange doesn't mean it has no discoverable cause. Why have we started\ncalling so many predictable things random? Well, many theories revolve around the amount up information and new people\nwe are confronted with at an increasing rate; now more than ever\nbefore. Perhaps it's just easier, almost a bit of a relief to call things random, so that we can move on to synthesise other information. Take a look at this die. Now, as you can see, it rolls a five most of the time but not all the time. Over time a sequence of its results will contain\nless randomness. But it is still random. Any face is\npossible and I have no guarantee beforehand of knowing which face will show up. The\noutcomes I'm selecting from make the resulting sequence less full of randomness but the process is still random. Even though a die and a coin are\nextremely sensitive to their initial conditions, and, over the course of normal use, are\nquite unpredictable, they do over time exhibit certain biases. Biases that make them a bit more predictable and a little less random than you might think. First of all, dice. Even\nprecision dice are only quality controlled within a few micrometers. You can check this out yourself. Make two stacks of ten or more similar dice. Now, if you orient each die every which way,\nyou should pretty much get two equally sized stacks But, if you arrange each stack along a shared axis, so that every die\nfaces the same way, any regular imperfections caused by the\nmanufacturing process may become visible. But what about coins? Well, some fantastic research has been\ndone on what happens when they spin and flip. For instance, it has been found that US\nnickel is just the right diameter and thickness to wind up landing not heads up or tails up when flipped,\nbut on its side, about once every six thousand\ntimes it's flipped. But what about the fairness of flipping\na coin? Well, if you flip a coin like this, for statistical and physical reasons\nthe side facing up before the flip begins, doesn't actually have\na fifty percent chance of being the result. Instead, as researchers at Stanford have\nfound, it actually has a fifty one percent chance. In this case it was the other side though. Still pretty random. If you want a coin flip to be as fair as possible, you should just catch it in your hand. Don't\nallow it to hit the ground, bounce, tumble and spin. That's because researchers have\nfound that when a coin spins larger biases come into play. The shape of its edge, its centre of gravity. The heavier side tends to go down quite often. In the case of some coins as often as eighty percent of the time. It's been\nfound that a one euro coin will spin, and land heads up, more often than not, and a US penny will land tails up more often than not when spun. But like I said earlier, theoretically if we knew\neverything about the initial conditions of a coin flip or a die roll, we could calculate beforehand their outcome. Why don't we do that more often? Well, it's extremely difficult. Insane amounts of precision would be required because the smallest difference between two initial\nconditions can be magnified over time leading to chaotic, extremely difficult\nto predict, results. Random.org, the service Derek and I used at the beginning of this video to generate a\nrandom number, uses atmospheric noise. It's extremely hard to predict, but technically still a deterministic system. All that noise came from somewhere and\nif we could just find out those initial conditions we could, theoretically, predict their outcomes. If we want a system more random than that we will need to find one that\nis determined by nothing and for that let's look closer. Quantumly close. Quantum mechanics may have our answer. It describes the properties of quantumly\nsized things as probabilities; just chances. Not because we don't know enough\nyet to be certain, or predict, but because, well, the idea is there's nothing there to predict. There is no beforehand we could know. Whether or not a particular individual\nradioactive atom will decay or not, or whatever the spin of an electron is, is only knowable once we look. They're\ndetermined by a deep-seated randomness woven into the universe itself. Einstein couldn't believe this.\nHe refused to accept, as he said, that \"God played dice with the universe.\" But... experiments with entangled particles have shown violations of Bell inequalities. Entangled particles are particles that\nexhibit similar properties even when separated by large distances. Now, if they agreed on those shared\nproperties to have, or are somehow determined beforehand to have them, their behaviors should satisfy Bell's famous inequalities.\nBut experiments have found that instead the likelihood of what a\nmachine will see when measuring one particle determines how the other machine will\nmeasure the other particle. It is here, when we look that the chance is\ndetermined. Explanations for this are even weirder but what the results\nsuggest is that the chance of seeing particular quantum qualities don't pre-exist. They happen when you look. So, if you are ever feeling boring or predictable, just remember that you are\nmade out of octillions of quantum probabilities. Dice that don't\ntumble in any analysable way we could ever predict. They are the most random thing. God may play dice with the universe, but they are the best dice in the universe. And as always, thanks for watching. But what does it all mean? Well, true randomness doesn't mean anything.\nI mean, for us to have meaning we need structure, predictability and that is what I'm\nexploring over on my channel, Veritasium. Wow, okay. So let's go over there and take a look at what is not random. Veritasium, let's go. I'll see you guys over there. \nIt's going to be awesome, come with us. And as always, thanks for watching.","_Oc9tKkH7WE":"Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. What's normal? Are you normal? Well, today let's bathe our brains with those questions and scrub down with things that are surprising and counterintuitive. What does it mean to be normal in the first place?\nWell, maybe it just means to be average. But an average can be a bit weird, a bit misleading. For instance, think of this way. The average human has one breast and one testicle. Also, the\naverage person has not climbed to the top of Gangkhar Puensum. In fact, no one has. Gangkhar Puensum is considered the tallest mountain on Earth that has yet to be summited. And it's unlikely it ever will be soon. It lies on the border of China and Bhutan\nand local governments believe the area to be holy, and no mountaineering or climbing is allowed. But don't worry, there are plenty\nmore. There are at least a hundred other recognised peaks that are quite tall and remain unsummitted. That's great. It's surprising to think that Earth has\nso many places that still have yet to be conquered or explored. At least, we were all\nborn here on Earth. Derek, from the YouTube channel Veritasium, where were you born? A small Australian town called Traralgon. But were you really born there? I'm suspicious of Derek's answer because saying that you were born on Earth's surface, is like saying you were born in a taxicab. The taxicab may still be around, but is\nit in the exact same location that it was at the moment of your birth? Probably not.\nLike a taxicab, the Earth is moving, and it's moving quickly. For one, the Earth is spinning. This is real time\nfootage of Earth spinning you don't notice much movement at all, but that's just because Earth is so large. To a distant observer beyond Earth, two seconds from now you will be an entire kilometre east\nfrom where you are now. Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, quickly. Three days ago, I was in Singapore. From\nthe reference frame of Earth's surface, Singapore is 6,000 kilometres\naway from this place. Sydney, Australia. But, in terms of Earth\norbiting around the Sun, three days ago I wasn't just 6,000 kilometres away, I was more than 7 million. The point is, where you were born, when you were born, is now just an empty region of space Earth will never, ever return to. My favourite surprise is\nthe solution to the Three Prisoners problem. It's related to the Monty Hall\nproblem but the stakes are higher. Its solution is notoriously\ncounter-intuitive. Let's say that myself, Kevin and Jake, have been arrested. \nAnd we are told that tomorrow morning two of us will be executed. We don't know which two, so it's a terrible night. But if I ask a guard to tell me\nsomething about what happens tomorrow and the guard says \"Michael, I won't tell\nyou anything about your fate and I won't tell you who lives, but I will\ntell you this little piece of information: tomorrow morning Jake is one of the guys who will be executed.\" What a relief(!) I used to have a one\nin three chance of being the one who lives, but now that I know Jake dies, it's just\nbetween Kevin and I. My chances of living have gone up from 1 in 3 to 1 in 2. This is great. Well, if I thought that I would actually be wrong. In fact, my chances of living\nhaven't changed at all and Kevin's are paradoxically now twice\nas good as mine. How can that be? Well, take a look at this. This circle represents the three possibilities. Either tomorrow Jake will live, Kevin will live or I will live. The hearts represent life. Isn't that beautiful? Now, let's focus on what the guard can tell me. In the case that Jake is the one who has been\nselected to live, both Kevin and myself will die tomorrow. But the guard cannot tell me anything\nabout myself, and he cannot tell me who lives, so if Jake is the one chosen to\nsurvive all the guard can tell me is that Kevin will be one of the guys\nwho dies tomorrow, that's it. Now, in this case, where Kevin is the guy selected to live, both myself\nand Jake will die tomorrow, but the guard can't tell me about myself and cannot tell me who lives. So all the\nguard can say is that tomorrow Jake is one of the guys who will die.\nHere's where it gets interesting. If I am the one who has been picked to\nlive tomorrow, the guard has a choice; he can either tell me that Kevin is the one who will die tomorrow or he\ncan tell me that Jake is one of the guys who will\ndie tomorrow. Well, look at what we've got here. If the guard tells me that Jake is one of the guys who will die tomorrow, I'm only faced now with these possibilities. In one-third of these cases I am the survivor, and in two-thirds of these cases Kevin is the survivor. My chances haven't changed and Kevin's are now twice as good as mine used to be. It is a beautiful day here in Sydney.\nBefore I arrived in Australia I was in Singapore, where it was also beautiful but incredibly humid. The air felt thick to move through and breathe, but in actuality humid air is less dense than dry air. Derek, tell us about Avogadro's Law. Well, Avogadro came up with the idea that in a given volume of gas at a given\ntemperature and pressure, there will be always the same number of gas particles.\nDoesn't matter what the gas is, if it's helium or nitrogen or oxygen. And that holds truth for air, which is a mixture of gases. That's right. So, it's got nitrogen and oxygen principally. But if it's humid air, then you replace\nsome of those nitrogens and oxygens with water. And water is wider than the diatomic nitrogen and oxygen that\nexists in our atmosphere. That's right.\nOxygen and nitrogen have masses of 32 and 28, whereas water is just 18. Humid air is actually much less dense than dry air. It's lighter and things can move\nthrough it more easily. This is especially true when it comes to baseballs. A baseball travels through humid air more easily, and further, with the same amount of\nenergy. If air becomes more humid and decreases drag by only five\npercent that can mean the difference between a fly ball and a home run. This became a problem when indoor baseball stadiums started to\nplay around with the idea of turning on the air conditioning when\nthe rival team came up to bat. Essentially, the air conditioning made the air dryer, therefore thicker and made the rival team hit baseballs shorter distances. The word normal, by the way, is homological. \nWhat does that mean? A homological adjective describes itself. For instance, the word tiny is pretty tiny. It's a small word. The word unhyphenated is unhyphenated. Normal is one of the top 1000 most commonly\nspoken and written words. The word normal is normal, it describes itself. But they're also words that are heterological;\nadjectives that don't describe themselves.\nFor instance, the word misspelled. Yes, well, if you don't misspell it. \nIf you don't misspell it. What about abbreviated? Ooo, I like that one, too. What about German? Not a German word. That's a good one.\nHow about monosyllabic? That's heterological because it doesn't describe itself.\nBut polysyllabic? For sure. I especially love just how homological pentasyllabic is. Yeah, five syllables. That is genius. Well, it's the way words are. The way they normally are. But what about you, are you normal? Well, a common way of defining normal is to say that something about you is\nnormal, if you fall within just one standard deviation of the average for all people. But there are a lot of things about you. You can easily think of, say, 36 different independent variables.\nDifferent things to say about yourself. For instance, how tall you are, how many\nfriends you have, how bad your breath is or, say, how often you lie. Now, the statistical\nprobability that you would be normal for all 36 of those different attributes is actually one in a million.\nWhich means, mathematically speaking, it is quite abnormal to be normal. And as always, thanks for watching.","vKA4w2O61Xo":"I'm gonna give you guys three numbers. A\nthree number sequence and I have a rule in mind that these three numbers obey\nand I want you to try to figure out what that rule is.

And then you can propose what you think the rule is. Is that fair? Okay, so here are the three\nnumbers: 2, 4, 8. 2, 4, 8. You don't need to continue the sequence,\nyou can propose a totally different sequence, whatever you want to propose\nand I will simply say yes or no 2, 4, 8? 16, 32 16 32 and 64?

Follows my rule. 10, 20, 40. That follows the rule. I'm still multiplying by two I know [Laughter] I know what you're doing. and yes it follows my rule but no it's not\nmy rule. 5, 10 and 20? Follows my rule 100, 200, 400? Follows my rule 500, 1000, 2000 Follows my rule. You want me to keep going? But do I just keep going? You going to tell me or what? [Laughter] Am I doing it the wrong way? Am I approaching this the wrong way? You're totally fine, but you're approaching the way most\npeople approach it. Like think strategically about this. You want information. I have\ninformation. The point of the three numbers, right, is to allow you to figure\nout what the rule is. Okay, I'm going to give you the\nnumbers that I don't think fits the sequence and see what you'll say. So I'll say 2, 4, 7. Fits my rule So, whatever I propose is right? So, is\nyour rule like you can propose any number? So, the rule is anything we say is yes? No Damn it [Laughter] But you were on the right track now. Hit me with three numbers. 3, 6, 9. Follows my rule. Hmm... Oh, that didn't follow my rule. This is good, right? 5, 10, 15. That follows my rule. What? Oh... Really? Yeah I don't believe this. 1, 2, 3? Follows the rule What about 7, 8, 9? [Laughter] Yes, that follows the rule. 8 16 39 Fits the rule. Excellent. But we're no closer to the rule. I want you\nget to the rule. How about 1, 7, 13 ? Follows the rule. 11, 12, 13? How does this make sense? Follows the rule. 10, 9, 8? I don't know how to do this. Does not follow the rule. 10, 9, 8 does not. Oh, so, is it all in ascending order? Boo yeah! Up top! Yes. First ones to get it. You guys nailed it That's the rule That's the rule. Numbers in increasing order. Awww Numbers in ascending order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, doesn't matter. Any numbers in ascending order. I was inspired to make this video by the\nbook the black swan by Nassim Taleb. Now, the black swan is a metaphor for the\nunknown and the unexpected. I mean in the old world the theory was\nthat all swans were white. So, each instance of a white swan would\nmake you think, \"Yeah, that theory is pretty good.\" But the point is you can never\nprove a theory true and in fact when people found Australia they realized\nthat there were black swans. What was interesting for me was that\neveryone I spoke to came up with a rule very early on and then only proposed\nnumbers that fit with that rule they were thinking. I was looking for you guys\nto propose a set of numbers that didn't follow your rule and didn't follow\nmy rule. I was looking for you guys not to try to confirm what you believe. \nYou're always asking something where you expect the answer  to be yes, right? Like, you're trying to get at it.\nBut, instead you want to get the no's. You want to get the no because that's much more\ninformational for you then yes, Like everything is a yes.. That is true. That is really true and\nonce you say that. That is what's so important about the scientific method. We set out to disprove our theories and it's when can't disprove them that we say this\nmust be getting at something really true about our reality. So, I think we should\ndo that in all aspects of our lives if you think that something is true you\nshould try as hard as you can to disprove it. Only then can you really get at the\ntruth and not fool yourself.","IlnZKSR73S0":"This is a neodymium magnet - it's pretty darn\nstrong. And now, after heating it in a flame... it's\nno longer magnetic. What just happened? Well, to build a magnet, all you need to do\nis find a bunch of magnetic atoms (that's easy - they're the ones with half-filled electron\nshells in the middle of any of the major blocks of the periodic table) and then make a compound\nwhere the magnetic fields of the atoms align in the same direction - this is Ferromagnetism,\nnamed after Iron, which is pretty darn magnetic. However, it's not so easy - sometimes the\natoms actually want to align their magnetic fields in alternating directions - this is\ncalled \"anti-ferromagnetism,\" and it means the bulk material won't have a magnetic field\nat all. Or, sometimes the tendency of the atomic magnets\nto align (or anti-align) is just too weak to overcome their intrinsic jiggling - that\nis, their temperature! In which case, even though all the individual\natoms in the material are magnetic, once more the material as a whole isn't. However, in a strong external magnetic field,\nthe atoms do tend to align with each other in the direction parallel to the field. This is called \"para-magnetism,\" and liquid\noxygen is a great example - it's attracted by a magnet, though it doesn't stay magnetized\nafterwards. But let's get back to the question - how do\nyou destroy a magnet? Well, a material can only be ferromagnetic\nif its temperature is low enough: above a certain point, the nicely ordered atomic magnetic\nfields \"melt\" into disorder, just as ice crystals melt into water when heated past zero celsius. So to destroy a magnet, you just need to heat\nit up past its \"magnetic melting point\", called the \"Curie Temperature\" - it probably won't\nlook like much is happening, but once the atoms are jiggling around enough, when they\ncool off, their magnetic fields will no longer all point in the same direction. Magnet destroyed! And just as different elements melt from solid\nto liquid at different temperatures, they also melt from being ferromagnetic to paramagnetic\nat different temperatures, which you can explore in this sweet interactive periodic table. Which also plays all  of  the Periodic Table  of Videos.","hFAOXdXZ5TM":"If you take a piece of wood and put it next\nto another piece of wood... nothing happens. And if you take a piece of granite and put\nit next to another rock... still nothing. But if you take this piece of iron and put\nit next to this other piece of iron... magic! I mean, magnet. Magnetic objects are able to magically attract\nat long distance because they generate magnetic fields that extend invisibly out beyond the\nobject. But the mystery is this: where do magnetic\nfields come from? Derek: well that's easy, Henry! We've known for a long time that electricity\nand magnetism are really just two sides of the same coin, kind of like mass and energy\nor time and space, and they can be transformed into each other. In fact, magnetic fields are basically just\nwhat electric fields turn into when an electrically charged object starts moving! Henry: That makes sense for explaining why\na current of electrons flowing through a wire causes this compass needle to move, or how\ncurrents in the earth's outer core generate the geomagnetic field... but a bar magnet\nor the compass needle itself are just pieces of metal without any electrical current running\nthrough them. Derek: Or are they? At a microscopic level, there are loads of\nelectrons whizzing around in the atoms and molecules that make up any solid. Henry: Right! This brings up an excellent point - The magnetic\nbehavior of any everyday object is influenced by a fascinating combination of effects ranging\nfrom the level of particles to atoms, collections of atoms, and collections of collections of\natoms. First, individual particles. Unlike the everyday workings of gravity and\nelectricity, permanent magnets can only be fully understood as a quantum mechanical effect. In much the same way that particles like electrons\nand quarks have fundamental properties called mass and electrical charge, most particles\nALSO have another intrinsic property, called \"tiny magnet\". Just kidding, it's called an \"intrinsic magnetic\nmoment,\" but really, that's just technical mumbo-jumbo saying that particles with electric\ncharge ALSO happen to be tiny magnets. Derek: If you want to know WHY they're tiny\nmagnets, well, you might as well ask WHY do particles have charge in the first place,\nor why do objects with energy and momentum attract gravitationally? No one knows... We just know these things are true\/that is\nhow the universe works. Henry: Exactly, and since the 1920s, we've\nknown that each individual electron or proton is basically a tiny magnet. Which brings us to the level of atoms. An atom is a bunch of positively charged protons\nwith a bunch of negatively charged electrons whizzing around them. The proton tiny magnets are about 1000 times\nweaker than the electron ones, so the nucleus of the atom has almost no effect on the magnetism\nof the atom as a whole. Derek: And you might think that since many\n(though not all) of the electrons are also moving, like the current in a wire, they would\ngenerate magnetic fields from that motion. Indeed they do, and these are called \"orbital\"\nmagnetic fields. Henry: Except, these don't usually contribute\nto the magnetic field of an atom. Here's why: Electrons in atoms are accurately and complicatedly\ndescribed by quantum mechanics, but the gist of the story is that electrons congregate\nin shells around the nucleus. The electrons in any filled shell zoom equally\nin all directions and so the currents they generate cancel out and generate no magnetic\nfield. These electrons also come in pairs whose tiny\nmagnets point in opposite directions and also cancel. However, in a half-filled shell, all of the\nelectrons are unpaired and their tiny magnets point in the same direction and add up, meaning\nthat it's the intrinsic magnetism of the electrons in the outer shell that gives an atom the\nmajority of its magnetic field. So atoms near the side of any of the major\nblocks of the periodic table, which have full (or nearly full) outer electron shells, aren't\nvery magnetic. And atoms in the MIDDLE of the blocks have\nhalf-full outer electron shells and are magnetic. For example, Nickel, Cobalt, Iron, Manganese,\nChromium, etc. Derek: Wait, but chromium isn't magnetic! Henry: Ah, but just because an atom is magnetic\ndoesn't mean that a material made up of lots of that atom will be magnetic. Which brings us to the level of crystals. When a bunch of magnetic atoms get together\nto make a solid, they generally have two options. One is for all of the atoms to align their\nmagnetic fields with each other, or they can align the magnetic fields in an alternating\nfashion so that they all cancel out. The atoms will do whichever one requires less\nenergy. Derek: That's why chromium, for example, is\na very magnetic atom but a very un-magnetic solid - because it's one of the most anti-ferromagnetic\nmaterials we know. Iron, on the other hand, is the name-sake\nof ferromagnetism, so it is, unsurprisingly, ferromagnetic. Or, in usual parlance: magnetic. Henry: Sometimes. The last and final level of magnetism is that\nof domains. Essentially, even in a magnetic material where\nthe magnetic fields of atoms line up together, it's possible that one chunk of the material\nwill have all its atoms lined up pointing one way, and another chunk will have all its\natoms pointing another way, and so on. Derek: If all of these \"Domains\" are of approximately\nsimilar size, none may be strong enough to force the others to align with it, and so\na piece of iron, for example, might have no magnetic field because of all of the warring\nmagnetic kingdoms within it. Henry: However, if you apply a strong enough\nmagnetic field\/force\/pressure from outside the material, you can help favor one domain\/help\none domain expand its control over its neighbors, and so on until all of the domains have been\nunified into one kingdom, all pointing in the same direction. Derek : And now, finally, you can rule with\nan iron fist... I mean, magnet. Henry: Exactly! What's remarkable is that magnetism is a fundamentally\nquantum property amplified to the size of everyday objects: every permanent magnet is\na reminder that quantum mechanics underlies our universe - in order for any object to\nbe magnetic, it has to have a unified kingdom of magnetic domains, each made up of bajillions\nof magnetic atoms which also need to be aligned with each other, each of which can only be\nmagnetic in the first place if it has an approximately half-filled outer shell of electrons so their\nintrinsic magnetic fields can align and not cancel each other out. Not surprisingly, these criteria are pretty\ndifficult to fulfill, which is why there are only a limited number of suitable materials\nyou can use when you're building a magnet. Derek: OR you could just run a current through\nany electrical conductor and generate a magnetic field that way. Henry: But hey... Why does that work in the first place? Click here to go to over to Veritasium and\nwe'll find out what special relativity and the speed of light have to do with electromagnets.","yXT012us9ng":"The temperature of regular stuff is basically\njust a measurement of jiggliness of the atoms and molecules that make that stuff up. More jiggling, higher temperature. Less jiggling, lower temperature. Of course, when something's at a high temperature,\nit feels hot, and when something's at a low temperature, it feels cold. Right? mmmjhyyaaanot exactly If you touch a piece of metal and a book that\nhave been sitting in your fridge, the metal will feel much colder than the book - Derek\nof Veritasium did a great video on this, but you really have to try it for yourself to\nbelieve it! The metal and the book are honestly at the\nsame temperature as measured by a thermometer, but the metal FEELS colder. This isn't just a trick of the mind, though\n- we experience the metal as \"colder\" than the book for a very physical reason: metal\nis a conductor, and paper is an insulator, so the ENERGY, or jiggliness of the molecules\nin our hands, is absorbed more quickly by the metal than by the book. Even though the book and the metal are at\nthe same temperature, the metal causes the temperature of our hands to go down faster,\nand thus, we experience the metal as being colder - because the temperature of our hands\nis what we really feel. It's like how, technically, a mercury thermometer\nreally only measures its own temperature and you can only indirectly measure temperatures\nof other things by putting them in thermal contact with it. Similarly, the thermoreceptive nerves in our\nskin can only directly measure the temperature of the skin itself and not of anything else. So when we touch something, we don't feel\nits temperature, but rather, we feel its effect on our skin: that is, how much and how quickly\nit transfers thermal energy - that's the jiggling of molecules - to or from us. The capacity to transfer thermal energy is\nalso why a blast of steam from your stovetop can feel so much hotter than a blast of hot\ndry air from your oven, even though the oven has a higher temperature: water vapor transfers\nmore molecular jiggling to your skin than air by itself. In fact, it's tempting to say that \"hot\" and\n\"cold\" are fundamentally different concepts from \"high temperature\" and \"low temperature\",\neven though we usually use the words interchangeably. \"Hot\" really means \"it gives off a lot of\nenergy\" while high temperature means \"it has a lot of energy\" - and as anyone who's tried\nfundraising knows, just because somebody has a lot of something, doesn't necessarily mean\nthey give a lot  of it away.","MPrepwOt3o0":"Picture this: You were thrown into a dingy room and told \"You\ncan't leave until you have created the thinnest material known to man.\" Not only that, it must also be the strongest, the best thermal conductor, and as good at conducting electricity as\ncopper. I know, it sounds hopeless. But luckily, you know something about nanotechnology. You know, really really tiny devices and materials\nthat are less than a hundred nanometres in size. Of course, I don't have to tell you a\nnanometre is a billionth of a meter. That's roughly the size of ten atoms. But how do you create something that\ntiny? It's time to embrace your inner MacGyver. You're gonna need a pencil, some scotch tape and a healthy dose of elbow grease. A pencil contains not lead but graphite,\nwhich consists of sheets of carbon in a hexagonal lattice. When you write, layers of graphite slide\noff the tip of the pencil and stick to the paper. Usually, many layers are stacked on top\nof each other but once in a while you get a single\nlayer of carbon atoms. And this is called 'graphene'. In 2004, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov created graphene using nothing but graphite and\nscotch tape. They placed a graphite flake onto the\ntape, folded it in two and then cleaved the flake in half. They repeated this procedure a number\nof times and then studied the resulting fragments. To their astonishment they found some of the pieces were only a\nsingle atom thick. This was particularly unexpected because\nit was thought a single layer of graphite would not be chemically stable, especially at room temperature. Graphene conducts electrons faster than\nany other substance at room temperature. This is because of the extraordinarily high\nquality of the graphene lattice. Scientists are yet to find a single atom\nout of place in graphene. Since the electrons aren't scattered by\ndefects in the lattice, they go so fast that Einstein's relativity must be used to \nunderstand their motion. And this perfect lattice is created by the\nvery strong yet flexible bonds between carbon atoms -  making the substance bendable but harder than diamond. Graphene is incredibly strong -  if you could balance an elephant on a pencil and support the pencil on graphene, the graphene wouldn't break. Of course the pencil would. For their discovery, Geim and Novoselov\nwere awarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 2010. And this is only the beginning for\nGraphene. Scientists are hard at work exploiting\nits unique properties to create:  Thin, transparent, flexible touch screens;  Smaller, faster, more energy efficient\ncomputers; Tough composite materials; And more efficient solar cells. And now consider: this is only one aspect\nof nanotechnology, so in order to think big you need first consider the very small.","myh94hpFmJY":"[WARNING! SPIDERS IN THE VIDEO ] Why are the most venomous species found in the warmest places on Earth? I mean, take Australia for example. Depending on who you ask, it has all or nearly all of the ten most venomous snakes in the world, plus the funnel-Web spider, the blue ringed octopus, box jellyfish, paralysis tick and stonefish, all found in Australia, are the most lethal of their kind and even this cute platypus has an ankle spur, which in the male, secretes a venom that can kill a dog. In humans it would merely cause excruciating pain. This question, why do the most venomous species live in the warmest places, is one that I've wondered about for most of my life. Perhaps it's because I was born here in the small town of Traralgon, Australia. This is the first house where I ever lived. As my mum recalls {Derek's Mum}\"in the backyard there was a shade where we found red backs, and I used to play in the shed? {Derek's Mum}\"I don't think once we found the red backs that we let you in there.\". Yeah, that's very comforting. Thanks mum. Now if you don't know what a red back is, it's a very poisonous spider. Hold up. I gotta tell past Derek something. You see it's important that we say venomous and not poisonous because poisonous means it'll be harmful if you eat it, whereas venomous means it'll try to eat you and that will be harmful. Continue. So thankfully they never bit me, otherwise, I wouldn't be standing   here today. Now before we go any further, it's probably worth asking, is it true, do more venomous species really live in hot places? Well apparently I'm not the only one who thinks so because I found this reddit thread on the topic. Though, it really didn't explain why that was the case. But what about the data? Well, here is a map of the global average temperatures. Compare that with this map that I've colored in according to the number of venomous species in each country. The country with the most venomous species is Mexico with eighty different organisms with the power to kill you. That's followed closely by Brazil and then Australia. Well this seems to all match up very well with the global average temperatures. So why is it so? My first hypothesis was that there's something about the heat which enables the formation of these venom molecules. So I ran that idea past Professor Polyakov of Periodic Videos {Professor Polyakov}\"no intent filter\" [alright] \"because the reason is that if you go up a ten degrees centigrade change in temperature round about room temperature [okay], will only double the rate of most chemical reactions and I don't think anything evolutionary is likely to evolve to such a big difference based on just a factor of two in the rates.\" So maybe it's worth asking what are these venom molecules exactly? Well, in most species where the venom is delivered by fangs it is evolved from saliva. In the funnel-web spider for example, the lethal effect seems quite accidental. What you've got to understand about venom, it's there, it's a secondary thing that it actually kills. The actual reason that spiders have got venom is to digest their prey. That they happen to do most of it before they actually eat it. Injecting the venom and the venom will start to liquefy whatever they've caught and, once it's turned to liquid, all spiders live on soup. The funnel-web evolved without any humans or other primates around and yet, ironically, its venom is most potent for exactly this group. Biggest  evolutionary joke ever, the only group of animals with backbones that's actually allergic to their venom are the primates. We don't have primates in Australia. All right, so it's lemurs, monkeys, apes and us. Thus most species deliver, not just one type of venom molecule but a whole cocktail of different proteins that range in length from short chain to very long chain molecules and these molecules can serve a range of functions. Some are neurotoxins which can disable your nervous system. Others are hemotoxins which actually attack your blood cells and can dissolve tissues, but since we're talking about cocktails, what would happen if you drank some venom? You could take a vial of taipan venom and happily have it with your scotch and it wouldn't be a problem as long as you didn't have any irritation on the mucosal lining or any stomach ulcer or things like this. It's got to get into the bloodstream to be a problem. Okay, so since drinking the venom is not gonna kill you, what should you do if you get bitten by say an inland taipan? That's the world's most venomous land snake. What you do? Don't panic. Stay calm. I think that would be easier said than done. The venom travels through the lymphatic system, so it doesn't usually travel through the veins or the blood vessels, so that's just quite close on under the skin, and if it reaches your nervous system it'll shut down the signaling pathways that keep your heart beating and your lungs breathing, and so what actually kills you is suffocation. So what you need to do is stay very still and bandage up the limb that's been bitten from the tip all the way back to your torso. Now the bandage needs to be really tight to trap the venom within the lymphatic system, but not so tight as to cut off the blood flow to the limb. Now once you've got it bandaged up, you need to find some anti-venom. What is anti-venom? Well, it's made by injecting a large organism like a horse with a dilute solution of the venom. The horse then produces antibodies for that venom which you can harvest and inject into yourself in case you get bitten. Making anti-venom is tough work. It would take seventy milkings of a funnel-web spider to get enough venom to make a single dose of anti-venom and what's worse anti-venom can only be used on an individual a limited number of times because over those uses your body will build up antibodies to the anti-venom making the anti-venom ineffective. So you might wonder well, why can't you just inject yourself with dilute amounts of venom and build up your own antibodies to the venom? That would work except for the fact that when you get bitten you need to have a lot of antibodies in your system and to keep your antibodies at that high level you would need to keep injecting yourself with the venom, say every month and that's probably not the best thing for you. But why is it that people in warm climates need to worry about this and not people in cold climates? Well, I went to the experts to find out about this trend. You know broadly, yeah, there's really not much of a pattern happening. Really? What about that reddit thread and the map I made? If you're saying, is there a global pattern showing that you get more venomous animals in hot places, I don't know if there is. In snakes, which is the group that I'm most familiar with, in Australia the pattern is the diametric reverse of that one. If you wander around Southern Australia, every snake you find on that Kosciusko is venomous. If you wander around the tropics of Darwin, you're very unlikely to see a venomous snake. They're all pythons and harmless colubrid snakes. Now this is unexpected. The most venomous snakes in Australia live in the coldest places and the reason for that is? 20 million years ago an itinerant sea snake coming down from Asia as Australia drifted up to Asia, got to Australia. It was venomous to start with. There were no snakes in Australia at the time and so venomous snakes radiated through Australia. This big family called the elapid II the Cobra family. Okay, but on a global scale, my point remains. There are more venomous species in hot countries. There's gonna be vastly more venomous snakes in a warm climate area than in a cold climate area. The problem is that there's vastly more snakes. So as a proportion of the snakes that are there, the venomous guys are probably going to be about the same and maybe even less in the case of a place like Australia than they would be in a cold area. So why are there more venomous species in warm places? Well the truth is there aren't, at least not as a proportion of species. The majority of venomous species on Earth are ectotherms. Those are organisms whose body temperatures are regulated by their surroundings. Now that means that they can only really have short bursts of energy, so instead of chasing down prey and running away from predators, they needed a different strategy to allow them to survive and so many of them evolved venom. There is a greater diversity of ectotherms in warm climates, so it only stands to reason that there will be a greater number of venomous species. But that's not to say that there aren't venomous species in cold places. The only snakes that get into the arctic circle are European vipers, a venomous species. But biodiversity alone isn't the complete answer to this question. It also depends on evolutionary history. If you had come to Australia 20 million years ago, there would have been no snakes at all. The venomous ones got here first and the non-venomous came after. I think it's a really lousy explanation, but it's the best one that we've got. Why is that a lousy explanation? Well it's doesn't invite any lovely complicated piece of ecological theory or anything else. It's just relying on history. But this is a pattern that's very strong and doesn't seem to be explicable any other way and nowadays in Hawaii there are no venomous snakes and the same goes for Jamaica. These are warm places that just haven't evolved or have lost any venomous snakes that they may have had. So it might just be a lucky accident that we've been fortunate enough to be blessed with a few venomous spiders. I am also reminded that we're living in a particular point in time, roughly 15,000 years after the last ice age. Now that would have wiped a lot of the ectotherms from the Northern Latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. For example, in Ireland there are no snakes because the place was wiped clean by an ice sheet and snakes haven't managed to get back to the island yet. My point is the distribution of species depends on what happened. It may be an unsatisfying explanation, but I'd rather know the truth than just believe in a trend that's not actually there. Really? [you're] a decimal What do you think is gonna happen to the spot on the screen as I narrow...  The color of the blue morpho is created by the structure of its scales Which is what you do - butterflies? But see all your organs [are] where the signs are getting lost - wings makes mathletes [a] trap the light and if you should not flare out Would never realize with the size learns and certainty [prints] directed alert so... As I started to go through this big investigation, I realize just how complicated this is and how many mysteries are still out there. For example, why are some species deadly venomous and in others the venom is is pretty weak, and I didn't end up with anything. The deadly guys turned out to have ecologies that are very similar to the guys with very weak venom and it may be a historical accident. Another strange observation is that a lot of snakes that have evolved more recently have actually lost the ability to produce venom. The big success story in snakes worldwide are the harmless ones. They've actually evolved from venomous snakes Venom is an ancestral characteristic in modern snakes. The successful snakes are the ones that left it behind and they gave it up and they're proliferated despite not having venom, Apparently the cost of making venom isn't much more than the cost of making saliva. So it seems curious that they would lose what seems to be a killer advantage over other species. If you have thoughts about this or any other mysteries regarding the global distribution of venomous species put them in the comments below.","vqDbMEdLiCs":"When you touch an object and it feels warm\nor cold, what is that really telling you about the object? Here, I have a metal hard drive and a book\nand I'm going to ask people to compare their temperatures. Which one do you think will feel warmer - the\nbook or the hard drive? The temperatures? Yeah, tell me if one is hotter or colder or\nif they're the same temperature. How do they feel? This is slightly cooler than this one. Oh, that's warmer. Yeah, agreed. I'd say the hard drive is a lot colder than\nthe book. 'Cause the book's got more knowledge. Why do you think that is? Metal's normally a little bit chillier if\nyou leave it in a colder temperature. What if I said they're both the same temperature? What would you say? I'd tell you you're lying. I'd think you were lying, yeah. Well, maybe the way I can prove it is I have\nan infrared thermometer. What do you think we're going to see? I think science might be able to answer that. And I'm not a scientist! Make a prediction for me. I still think that's colder. Would you bet me money? I don't have any cash. Let's measure the temperature of the book. What do you see? 19.0. OK. Now measure the temperature of that. 19.0. Alright, well, now I believe you. I'm trying to figure it out, actually. Trying to figure out why'd they be the same\ntemperature. They don't feel the same temperature, though. So, why does that feel colder if they're the\nsame? Good one. You know the answer? I'm coming to you guys for answers. We're creatives, not intellectuals. Well, create an answer for me! I'm not a scientist! Come on, you tell me. I'll try to answer that question with another\nlittle experiment. Here is an aluminium block. Ooh! Nice and cold. And a plastic block. How do their temperatures compare? Completely different. Aluminium's going to be much colder. Yeah? This actually feels colder. Let's take this to the next level. I'll put an ice cube on both plates. What will we see? I'm guessing it would stay solid on this one\nand melt on this one. So it's going to melt on the plastic but stay\nsolid on the aluminium? Yes, but maybe I'm wrong. That one will melt more quickly than on the\naluminium. You'd think so. Yeah, 'cause it's cold. I think they're the same. We put an ice cube on each of those. What do you see? It's melting quicker on the aluminium. My God, it's melting! This is melting quicker than that one, even\nthough this is aluminium and that's plastic. So which one felt colder? This one. How does that make sense? No idea. Could aluminium be bad for the environment? How would aluminium be bad for the environment? It's thawing the ice quicker, isn't it? You want the answer? Yes, please! It's about thermoconductivity - the rate at\nwhich heat is transferred from one object to another. So when you felt these blocks originally,\nI know this one felt a lot colder. But you know from the other example we did,\nthat they must both be the same temperature. True. They've both been outside for a while. We see the aluminium block is melting the\nice faster than the plastic block because it's conducting the heat to the ice cube faster. With the plastic block, it's a worse thermoconductor. So, heat is being transferred less quickly\nto this ice block and so it's staying iced. OK. I believe you. Make sense? Yes. Definitely. In our first example, the hard drive felt\ncolder, even though it was at the same temperature as the book. That's because the aluminium conducts heat\naway from your hand faster than the book conducts heat away from your hand. Sure. That seems logical. Which makes the hard drive feel colder and\nthe book feel warmer. So when you touch something, you don't actually\nfeel temperature. You feel the rate at which heat is conducted,\neither towards or away from you. Think about this next time you hop out of\nthe shower in winter. It's much nicer to stand on the bath mat than\non a towel beside it. Not because the bath mat is warmer but because\nit conducts heat less quickly away from you.","2KZb2_vcNTg":"Trees are some of the \nbiggest organisms on the planet, but where do they get that matter to grow? Man: Rich nutrients out the ground. Man: Start with soil or in the air. Man: Goodness out of the soil, I suppose. Derek Muller: Comes out of the soil? Man: Yeah... Derek Muller: Yeah... Derek Muller: Goodness. Man: Goodness. Derek Muller: Why isn't there a big hole \naround the tree where it's taking out all the soil? Man (right): 'Cause it does it so \ngradually that the soil is time to recover. Derek Muller: Now, I think it's intuitive to believe that the tree gets most of its mass from the soil because you can see those roots\ndigging into the soil and they must be taking something out of there and I mean\na tree looks like dirt and it feels solid like dirt but it's not. In the early 1600 a scientist \nnamed Johann Baptist Van Helmholt tried to figure out where the mass\nof a tree was coming from so he got a pot of soil and very carefully \nmeasured the amount of soil in there. Then he planted the tree and  \ntook care of it for five years making sure that no soil left or was added to his pot . At the end of this experiment he was weighted the tree \nto find that it was 72 kilograms but the massive soil had\nonly decreased by about 60 grams. This was pretty strong evidence that the\nmass of the tree does not come from the soil. I've never thought about that actually\nbecause they don't really eat anything, trees. They don't eat anything?\n--No. They don't eat anything? Water, it's all basically absorbed.\n--That's all they eat? Yeah.\n--They don't eat anything else? No.\n--That's all they eat.

To make--\n--Other than the original seed for that particular tree, I suppose. The seed, the soil, and the water and\nthat makes this big tree. Derek Muller: Of course Johann Baptist Van Helmholt\ndid conclude that the tree was made entirely of water. Now while that's not correct \nat least he was on the right track realizing that the matter of a tree \ndoesn't  come out of the soil. The sun energy, yeah. The sun energy?\n--Yeah. Are they converting energy into mass or--? Do you know what I mean?\n--Yeah. Like that there wasn't stuff and then  there was. Where did that stuff come from? Magic. [laughing]\nI have no idea. My question is where do they \nget that mass to grow big? Sun. Get it from the rain and the sun presuably. Light.\n--Sunlight. The sunshine.\nThe sunshine? Does the sunshine add mass to the tree? It would need sunshine to grow. Yes, they wouldn't grow without it.\nI don't know whether it adds mass, but they wouldn't go without it. Of course the sun's energy is needed for\nthe tree to build the matter into its branches and leaves but the Sun itself\nthe energy is not matter. Well I suppose you've got to put air into this as well. There's got to be something, you know. What is it about the air?\n--A gas in the air that it needs as well. Oxygen.\nThe trees need the oxygen? And I guess oxygen. The oxygen, of course. The oxygen? Are there any ingredients that we're missing? Carbon dioxide. Would it surprise you to find out that 95% \nof a tree is actually from carbon dioxide. Trees are largely made up of air. Yeah.\n--Surprising. I need this reaction like, \"Oh holy sh-- [laughing] So as it turns out trees are mostly made out of air, out of the carbon dioxide that they take in. What's interesting is that we breathe\nout carbon dioxide and water that's how we lose mass but it's the exact same substances\n that trees breathe in to gain mass. So if you can imagine a closed system \nwhere it's just you and a tree. You would breathe out that carbon\ndioxide and water the tree would take it in.

So I went around asking people 'what makes the Moon go around the Earth?'  and they told me.. The Earth puts a gravitational force on the moon\nBut does the moon put a gravitational pull on the Earth? Pull on the Earth yes. It does hence we have tides ETc the moon falls on the earth, [too] it affects like the tides and women and yes It [does] very powerful does the moon pull on the Earth probably that as well Yeah So what I want to know is How does that force that the moon exerts on the Earth how does that compare in terms of size? To the Force the Earth exerts on the moon Well... No scientist, but I think that one would be more powerful than that one It's got a greater force coming from the Earth because it's greater mass is the Earth has more Mass [cuz] it's a bigger mess. I thought greater mass is more [equals] more force [guys] Does the moon pull on the earth? Yes But a lot less Yeah, not as much as the Earth pulls on the moon. Yeah Yeah, but a little bit not [very] strongly. Yes But much much much much smaller because if it's mass [less], [not] size Because it's smaller. It's much smaller than [that] than the Earth because it's smaller. This is small Allow me to let you in on a little secret Everyone got it wrong The Force that attracts the moon to the Earth is exactly the same size as the force that attracts the Earth to the moon So what's going on here? Why did everyone get it wrong? Well, I think it comes down to cause and effect The effect of the force on the moon is quite clear the moon goes in circles around the Earth but the effect of that force on the Earth is basically negligible; the Earth barely wobbles at all So people interpret this Negligible effect as Indicating there's very little force affecting the Earth But that is forgetting the third key piece of the puzzle which is inertia Inertia is the tendency of Mass to Maintain State of motion Since the Earth has a greater, mass It has a greater, inertia and so even with the same amount of force on it It doesn't accelerate that much now the funny thing [is] many of the [people] I interviewed Could state Newton's third law which is every [force] has not equal and opposite reaction Something about Newton's law doesn't seem to fit into that [just] yet. You're good at this wait Which Newton's law are we talking about the whole equal and opposite force thing? Yeah, that one. So tell me what you're thinking man [ah] well Did one would think that if you're into putting a force on me I would be putting an equal Force upon it So why didn't they apply it to this problem? Well, I think they may have memorized the words, but not really [believed] Newton's third law in their core Did they really feel it in their spleen [I]? Don't think they did so Allow me to try to convince you, all of you spleen included, that Newton's third law really is true Let's consider two objects Initially they have the same Mass 1 kilogram each So obviously the gravitational force of attraction must be the same on both of the objects Now let's add a second kilogram to the first object The Force on the second object will now be twice as great because that 1 kilogram is attracted equally to each of the kilograms in the first object But what is often forgotten is that new kilogram is also attracted to the second object meaning that the total force on each object is still the same they're attracted to each other with an equal and opposite Force We could add a third kilogram And we would find the same thing the force on both objects is still the same Even though the object on the left has [3] times the mass of the object on the right? So we can see that no matter what the mass, any two objects will have the same gravitational force towards each other. Can you feel Newton's third law in your spleen now? It should settle inside you and become a part of you","vWVZ6APXM4w":"Alright here is the setup: I have a rifle\nmounted vertically and we're going to shoot a bullet into this block, right into the middle\nof it. So obviously the block is going to go flying\ninto the air. But we're going to do this again and instead\nof firing the bullet right into the middle of the block, we're going to shoot it off\nto one side and I want you to make a prediction. Will that spinning block, when we shoot hit\nit to one side, will it go the same height as this first block? Will it go not as high? Or will it go higher? OK so versus being shot in the middle, when\nyou shoot on the side is the question, right? Yeah. How high will it go in comparison? It depends on if the bullet stays in the block\n- and I'm assuming it does? It does stay in the block, yes, I'll guarantee\nyou that. Same height. I'm purely basing it on just like an instinct\nthat I have. I feel like I'm being tricked. I just feel like you're trying to trick us\nand that it's going to do something that we can't predict. I feel like the obvious answer is not as high\nso I'm going to say higher. I'll say higher, but it's going to like fly\nin a different direction or something. So you have angular momentum, which is L,\nand you have translational momentum, which is P. When you hit it in the middle of the\nblock, the block doesn't really spin at all so it just goes up to a certain height. But when you hit it on the side of the block,\nit's going to be spinning so it's going to have imparted some kinetic energy so there\nwon't be as much potential energy. So the total energy of the system basically\nhas to stay constant and the kinetic plus potential, which would be the height it goes\nto will have to be constant so if it's spinning it has kinetic energy, it can't go as high. That's my prediction. So my prediction is it'll go up, not as high\nbut it'll spin more if it's hit to the side. Am I wrong? I want you to think which do you think is\nthe most reasonable and then click one of the annotations above. Alright are you ready?

Like in the middle of the turntable you can put some water and then add liquid nitrogen, and this creates a kind of fog these tiny water droplets that spread out from the middle, but because the actual linear speed of this turntable is increasing the further out you go well, the vapor falls further and further behind creating a swirl, that looks a little bit like a Hurricane. And that analogy is not by accident, the Earth is after all one giant turntable, and the weather patterns we get are a result of that. When you study Physics in rotating frames of reference, or even just rotating bodies. You find some pretty mysterious and counterintuitive phenomena, which is why I'm dedicating this video to four revolutionary riddles. Number one here I have a ramp, or an inclined plane and just to show you i'm not doing anything funny with it, if I just let a roll of tape go it will accelerate down the ramp. But! Here I have a mystery cylinder, and I'm going to place that on the ramp, and we will see that it rolls, and then it stops, and then rolls, and then stops. So my question to you is. What is In the mystery cylinder? What is this object? Number two, take a bicycle and have someone support it, so it doesn't fall over or lean it up against something, and then take a bit of string and tie it to the bottom pedal. Now what I'm going to do is pull backwards horizontally on this string, and I want you to predict what the bike will do. Will it go backwards? Forwards? Or will it just stay there and not move. My intuition would tell me that it would go forward? I think it might not move if you're going to be pulling backwards from a stationary point on the pedal, you're going to be pulling it backwards just as the pedals are tying to spin the wheels forward, so maybe it might not move. Things gonna go forward, I'll go forward. Sure? Yeah, I'm sure. all right three, two, one. Number three. I want you to think about running two laps of this track now the first lap you can go as slowly as you like, let's call that speed V1. But on your second lap, I want you to run faster. Such that the total average speed for both laps combined is twice V1, twice the speed of your first lap so the question for you is. How fast do you have to run that second lap, so that your total average speed, is two V1? Number four, any time a train is moving, either slowly or very fast. There is a part of the train which is actually moving backwards with respect to the ground, that is not backwards with respect to the train, and it doesn't have to be going so slowly that if you ran backwards you would be going backwards with respect to the ground. It is at any speed, any normal train will have a part of it, which is moving backwards with respect to the ground. My question to you is. Which part is it? now with these four riddles, you can make me a video response if you like to tell me about your solutions to them.

It's OK; I'll wait.\nJust click this card up here. [Ticking clock sound] Now, when I filmed the riddles, \nI also filmed the solutions at the same time, but that was before I received your 15,000 comments and dozens of video responses, so I'm re-shooting parts of this solutions video to incorporate the results I saw in the comments and to use some of your video responses to help explain the solutions. Let's get to it! OK, by looking at the comments, for #1,\nover 15% of you said \"a cylinder containing sand\", Now, this contains some powder. [Chuckles]\nSee how it rolls... It, uhh, it doesn't seem to roll... ...very far before it stops,\nand then it won't roll again because I think the sand just kind of levels off in there. Maybe you were thinking a bigger kind of sand, like these small gravely stones. Let's try that. That actually rolls pretty well. Nearly 25% of you said,\n\"a cylinder half-full of water,\" so let's try that. This rolls very well, so it's not water... and nearly 45% of you said,\n\"a cylinder half-full of a viscous liquid.\" Here, I have a half-full container of honey, so let's see how it rolls... That's not bad;\nit's rolling and it's stopping, and it's rolling some more... This is a pretty good guess, and I think the behavior is not exactly the same as the mystery cylinder, but it definitely is similar, and that's no coincidence. The mystery cylinder actually contains honey... and ping pong balls. There are two ping pong balls submerged in this honey. So if I place that on the ramp, the center of gravity is not above the point of contact with the ramp, and so it rolls forward, but now, because those ping pong balls are in the front, they change the center of gravity, and so it's exactly over the point of contact, and so it stops briefly, but then, as the viscosity of the honey allows those\nping pong balls to move up, the center of gravity shifts forwards again,\nallowing this little container to roll. So that is the trick of the mystery cylinder. Pretty easy if you want to try it out at home. Now, I challenged you to run two laps of this track,\nwhere the first lap, you could go as slowly as you like, but the second lap, you had to go much faster, such that your total average speed was twice\nthe speed of your first lap. Now, when I was first asked this question\nby Simon Pampena, it took me a long time and scribbling on paper,\nand just something didn't seem to work out, and that's because... you can't actually do this. It's impossible. I mean, you might think I could run 3V\u2081 for my 2nd lap, and that would mean my total average speed is 2V\u2081. The problem is you can't just add the two speeds together and divide by two, because you spent much more time in your first lap, so that speed is weighted more heavily into the average, so you'd have to run, well, impossibly fast. Let me explain. The velocity of the first lap was the distance around the track divided by t\u2081, the time it took you. Now, if you want your total average speed to be 2V\u2081, well then it needs to be 2d \u00f7 t\u2081. You need to run twice the distance in the same amount of time it took you to run the first lap, but you've already run that first lap, and so you have\nno time remaining to run the second lap! Even if you went the speed of light, you would not be able to increase your total average speed up to twice the velocity of your first lap. It is just mathematically impossible! So this may seem like a bit of a trick question, but the point to me is how doable it sounds,\nhow it seems like something you should be able to do, but you can't.\nIt's actually impossible. Riddle #4, the question about the train, was actually answered pretty well, with most people mentioning something to do with the wheels, but of course, that makes sense, in a series of riddles which are about rotation, rotational motion. Some people though did point out that maybe it was the steam that was going backwards, or maybe air molecules in the train, \nand that is actually a pretty clever point, however I wouldn't really consider the air in the train part of the train, so indeed, the part of the train that is moving backwards is the flange part of the wheel,\nwhich is below the rail. That is the part of the train which is moving backwards. To understand why,\nyou just think about a spinning wheel. The top of the wheel is moving forwards at speed 2V, and the bottom of the wheel is not moving forward at all; it is stationary with respect to the track, and that is what we call \"rolling without slipping,\"\nand that's how most wheels work. At least, that's how they're designed to work. Now, in the case of trains, they have to have flanges so the train doesn't fall off its rails, but of course, when these pieces come around during the rotation of the wheel, they actually extend beyond the rail, and therefore,\nthey are going backwards with respect to the ground, so the part of the train that's moving backwards is always changing, but it's always that part of the flange, that part that extends beyond the wheel that is below the level of the track. So what happens when you pull\nthe bottom pedal of a bike backwards? Well, about 45% of you thought that\nthe bike would move backwards, about a quarter said it would move forwards,\nand a quarter said the bike wouldn't move at all, and 5% said it depends on something... So let's give it a shot and see what happens. I'm going to pull backwards on the bike pedal\nin 3, 2, 1... Woah! The bike did indeed move back, and for virtually all bikes, this is what you will find, but the explanation is not just as simple as\n\"well, the net force on the bike is back, so therefore, it has to accelerate backwards,\" and to prove that that logic doesn't work,\nwell, just have a look at this video by George Hart. [George] Watch this. \nAgain, I pull the same pedal backward, but now... the bike moves forward! [Derek] I'll put a link to the full video here\nand a link to his website in the description. So the reason the bike moves backwards is because of the way these gears are set up, the diameter of the tire, and also, the distance from this crank to the pedal itself. Because as a bike moves forwards, the pedal, even when you're pushing back on it, never actually moves backwards with respect to the ground; it's always moving forwards. [George] So if you drag a string\nbehind the pedal of a bike moving forward, the string is always moving forward. Now just play that movie backward in your mind, and it may be clear how pulling the string backward could make the bike move backward; They move forward together,\nso they move backward together. [Derek]\nAnother way to think about this is to consider the path traced out by the pedal\nas the bike moves forward. This is called the trochoid. For all ordinary bikes, \nthe pedals are moving much slower than the tires, so the pedal is always going forward\nwith respect to the ground, but George modified his bike so the ratio of the pedal to the wheel radius was greater than the ratio of the front sprocket to the back sprocket, and this ultra-low gear changes the trochoid\nso the pedal DOES actually go backwards with respect to the ground as the bike goes forwards, and that's why he could pull back on the pedal and make the bike go forwards. This is the same reason why if you were to pull backwards on the flange of a train wheel, you could actually get the train to move forwards,\nif you pulled backwards with enough force. For all normal bicycles, pulling back like this on the bottom pedal will cause the bicycle to move backwards, but, depending on the gear ratio,\nyou can get the bike to move forwards, so it was those people who said it depends on the ratio of these gears and the size of this crank to the radius of the back wheel that were actually the most correct.","IcrBqCFLHIY":"In this phone, there are nearly 100 million\ntransistors, in this computer there's over a billion. The transistor is in virtually every electronic\ndevice we use: TV's, radios, Tamagotchis. But how does it work? Well the basic principle is actually incredibly\nsimple. It works just like this switch, so it controls\nthe flow of electric current. It can be off, so you could call that the\nzero state or it could be on, the one state. And this is how all of our information is\nnow stored and processed, in zeros and ones, little bits of electric current. But unlike this switch, a transistor doesn't\nhave any moving parts. And it also doesn't require a human controller. Furthermore, it can be switched on and off\nmuch more quickly than I can flick this switch. And finally, and most importantly it is incredibly\ntiny. Well this is all thanks to the miracle of\nsemiconductors or rather I should say the science of semiconductors. Pure silicon is a semiconductor, which means\nit conducts electric current better than insulators but not as well as metals. This is because an atom of silicon has four\nelectrons in its outermost or valence shell. This allows it to form bonds with its four\nnearest neighbours, Hidey ho there! G'day\nWasaaaaap!? So it forms a tetrahedral crystal. But since all these electrons are stuck in\nbonds, few ever get enough energy to escape their bonds and travel through the lattice. So having a small number of mobile charges\nis what makes silicon a semi-conductor. Now this wouldn't be all that useful without\na semiconductor's secret weapon -- doping. You've probably heard of doping, it's when\nyou inject a foreign substance in order to improve performance. Yeah it's actually just like that, except\non the atomic level. There are two types of doping called n-type\nand p-type. To make n-type semiconductor, you take pure\nsilicon and inject a small amount of an element with 5 valence electrons,\nlike Phosphorous. This is useful because Phosphorous is similar\nenough to silicon that it can fit into the lattice, but it brings with it an extra electron. So this means now the semiconductor has more\nmobile charges and so it conducts current better. In p-type doping, an element with only three\nvalence electrons is added to the lattice. Like Boron. Now this creates a 'hole' - a place where\nthere should be an electron, but there isn't. But this still increases the conductivity\nof the silicon because electrons can move into it. Now although it is electrons that are moving,\nwe like to talk about the holes moving around -- because there's far fewer of them. Now since the hole is the lack of an electron,\nit actually acts as a positive charge. And this is why p-type semiconductor is actually\ncalled p-type. The p stands for positive - it's positive\ncharges, these holes, which are moving and conducting the current. Now it's a common misconception that n-type\nsemiconductors are negatively charged and p-type semiconductors are positively charged. That's not true, they are both neutral because\nthey have the same number of electrons and protons inside them. The n and the p actually just refer to the\nsign of charge that can move within them. So in n-type, it's negative electrons which\ncan move, and in p-type it's a positive hole that moves. But they're both neutral! A transistor is made with both n-type and\np-type semiconductors. A common configuration has n on the ends with\np in the middle. Just like a switch a transistor has an electrical\ncontact at each end and these are called the source and the drain. But instead of a mechanical switch, there\nis a third electrical contact called the gate, which is insulated from the semiconductor\nby an oxide layer. When a transistor is made, the n and p-types\ndon't keep to themselves -- electrons actually diffuse from the n-type, where there are more\nof them into the p-type to fill the holes. This creates something called the depletion\nlayer. What's been depleted? Charges that can move. There are no more free electrons in the n-type\n-- why? Because they've filled the holes in the p-type. Now this makes the p-type negative thanks\nto the added electrons. And this is important because the p-type will\nnow repel any electrons that try to come across from the n-type. So the depletion layer actually acts as a\nbarrier, preventing the flow of electric current through the transistor. So right now the transistor is off, it's like\nan open switch, it's in the zero state. To turn it on, you have to apply a small positive\nvoltage to the gate. This attracts the electrons over and overcomes\nthat repulsion from the depletion. It actually shrinks the depletion layer so\nthat electrons can move through and form a conducting channel. So the transistor is now on, it's in the one\nstate. This is remarkable because just by exploiting\nthe properties of a crystal we've been able to create a switch that doesn't have any moving\nparts, that can be turned on and off very quickly just with a voltage, and most importantly\nit can be made tiny. Transistors today are only about 22nm wide,\nwhich means they are only about 50 atoms across. But to keep up with Moore's law, they're going\nto have to keep getting smaller. Moore's Law states that every two years the\nnumber of transistors on a chip should double. And there is a limit, as those terminals get\ncloser and closer together, quantum effects become more significant and electrons can\nactually tunnel from one side to the other. So you may not be able to make a barrier high\nenough to stop them from flowing. Now this will be a real problem for the future\nof transistors, but we'll probably only face that another ten years down the track. So until then transistors, the way we know\nthem, are going to keep getting better. Once you have let's say three hundred of these\nqubits, then you have like two to the three hundred classical bits. Which is as many particles as there are in\nthe universe.","g_IaVepNDT4":"A classical computer performs operations using\nclassical bits, which can be either zero or one. Now in contrast, a quantum computer users\nquantum bits or qubits. And they can be both zero and one at the same\ntime. And it is this that gives a quantum computer\nits superior computing power. There are a number of physical objects that\ncan be used as a qubit. A single photon, a nucleus or an electron. I met up with researchers who were using the\noutermost electron in phosphorous as a qubit. But how does that work? Well, all electrons have magnetic fields,\nso they are basically like tiny bar magnets. And this property is called spin. If you place them in a magnetic field they\nwill align with that field, just like a compass needle lines up with the magnetic field of\nthe earth. Now this is the lowest energy state, so you\ncould call it the zero state or we call it for the electron, spin down. Now you can put it in a one state, or spin\nup, but that takes some energy. >> If you took out the glass from your compass\nyou could turn the needle the other way, but you would have to apply some force to it. You have to push it to flip to the other side. And that is the highest energy state. In principle, if you were so delicate to really\nput it exactly against the magnetic field, it would stay there. >> Now so far this is basically just like\na classical bit. It has got two states, spin up and spin down,\nwhich are like the classical one and zero. But the funny thing about quantum objects\nis that thy can be in both states at once. Now when you measure the spin it will be either\nup or down. But before you measure it, the electron can\nexist in what is called a quantum super position, where these coefficients indicate the relative\nprobability of finding the electron in one state or the other. Now it is hard to imagine how this enables\nthis incredible computing power of quantum computers without considering two interacting\nquantum bits. >> Hello. >> Hi. Now there are four possible states of these\ntwo electrons. >> You could think that, well, that is just\nlike two bits of a classical computer, right? If you have two bits you can write zero, zero;\nzero, one; one, zero; one, one. Right? There is four numbers. But these are still just two bits of information. Right? All I need to say to determine which one of\nthe four numbers you have in your computer code is the value of the first bit and the\nvalue of the second bit. Here, instead, quantum mechanics allows me\nto make super position of each one of these four states. So I can write a quantum mechanical state,\nwhich is perfectly legitimate, that is some coefficient times this plus some coefficient\ntimes that plus some coefficient times that plus some coefficient times that. So determine the state of this two spin system,\nI need to give you four numbers, four coefficients, whereas in the classical example of the two\nbits, I only need to give you two bits. So this is how you understand why two qubits\nactually contain four bits of information. I need to give you four numbers to tell you\nthe state of this system, whereas here I only need two. Now if we make three spins, we would have\neight different states and it could give you eight different numbers to define the state\nof those three spins, whereas classical it is just three bits. If you keep going, what you find is that the\namount of equivalent classical information contained by N qubits is two to the power\nN classical bits. And, of course, the power of exponentials\ntells you that once you have, let\u2019s say, 300 of those qubits in what we call the folient\nangle state, so you must be able to create these really crazy states where there is a\nsuper position of all three angles being one way and another way and another way and so\non, then you have like two to the 300 classical bits, which is as many particles as there\nare in the universe. >> But there is a catch, although the qubits\ncan exist in any combination of states, when they are measured they must fall into one\nof the basis states. And all the other information about the state\nbefore the measurement is lost. >> So you don\u2019t want generally to have as\nthe final result of your quantum computation something that is a very complicated super\npositional state, because our cannot measure a super position. You can only measure one of these basis states. >> Like down, down, up, up. >> Yeah. So what you want is to design the logical\noperations that you need to get to the final computational result in such a way that the\nfinal result is something you are able to measure, just a unique state. >> That is not trivial. >> That is not trivial. And it is essentially ... I am kind of stretching\nthings, but I guess it is to some degree the reason why quantum computers are not a replacement\nof classical computers. >> They are not. >> No, they are not. They are not universally faster. They are only faster for special types of\ncalculations where you can use the fact that you have all these quantum super positions\navailable to you at the same time, to do some kind of computational parallelism. If you just want to watch a video in high\ndefinition or browse the internet or write some documenting work, they are not going\nto give you any particular improvement if you need to use a classical algorithm to get\nthe result. So you should not think of a quantum computer\nas something where every operation is faster. In fact, every operation is probably going\nto be slower than in the computer you have at your desk. But it is a computer where the number of operations\nrequired to arrive at the result is exponentially small. So the improvement is not in the speed of\nthe individual operation. It is in the total number of operations you\nneed to arrive at the result. But that is only the case in particular types\nof calculations, particular algorithms. It is not universally, which is why it is\nnot a replacement of a classical computer.","zNzzGgr2mhk":"To find the prime factors of a 2048 number\nit would take a classical computer millions of years, a quantum computer could do it in\njust minutes. And that is because a quantum computer is\nbuilt on qubits, these devices which take advantage of quantum super position to reduce\nthe number of steps required to complete the computation. But how do you actually make a qubit in practice\nand how do you read and write information on it? I met up with researchers who are using the\nouter most electron in a phosphorous atom as a qubit. This single phosphorous atom is embedded in\na silicon crystal right next to a tiny transistor. Now the electron has a magnetic dipole called\nits spin. And it has two orientations, up or down, which\nare like the classical one and zero. Now to differentiate the energy state of the\nelectron when it is in spin up and spin down, you need to apply a strong magnetic field. >> And to do that we use a super conducting\nmagnet. So super conducting magnet is a large solenoid. It is a coil of super conducting wire that\nsits inside of that vessel that is full of liquid helium. >> So now the electron will line up with its\nspin pointing down. That is its lowest energy state. And it would take some energy to put it into\nthe spin up state. But actually not that much energy and if it\nwere at room temperature the electron would have so much thermal energy that it would\nbe bouncing around from spin up to spin down and back. And so you need to cool down the whole apparatus\nto only a few hundredths of a degree above absolute zero. That way you know that the electron will definitely\nbe spin down. >> There is not enough thermal energy in the\nsurroundings to flip it the other way. >> Now if you want to write information onto\nthe qubit, you can put the electron into the spin up state by hitting it with a pulse of\nmicrowaves. But that pulse needs to be a very specific\nfrequency and that frequency depends on the magnetic field that the electron is sitting\nin. >> So what you see here is the frequency that\nis being produced by this microwave source and it is 45.021 gigahertz, which in the magnetic\nfield that we are applying now is the resonance frequency of the electron. >> So the electron is a little bit like a\nradio that can only tune in to one station. And when that station is broadcasting, the\nelectron gets all excited and turns to the spin up state. >> But you can stop at any point. So if you just make a new tape and stop your\npulse and some specific point, what you have created is a special quantum super position\nof the spin up and spin down states with a specific phase between the two super positions. >> And how do you read out the information? Well, you use the transistor that this phosphorous\natom is embedded next to. >> The spin down has the lower energy. And the spin up has the higher energy. Now in this transistor there is, in fact,\na little bundle of electrons. This bundle of electrons is filled up up to\na certain axis. This vertical axis here is energy. And here we have got all these electrons that\nline up in energy just like the electrons on the shells of an atom. So now if the electron is pointing up, it\ncan jump into the transistor, right, because it has more energy than all the others. It leaves behind the bare nuclear charge of\nthe phosphorous, right? The phosphorous one more positive charge in\nthe nucleus as compared to silicon, but normally it is neutralized by the extra electron so\nthe two things cancel out. But if you take the electron away, then the\nphosphorous has a positive charge. So it is as if you have a positive voltage,\na more positive voltage applied to this gate. It doesn\u2019t come from the gate. It comes from the atom, but is the same. It is just a positive voltage. >> It is like the transistor has been switched\nmore on. And so you see a pulse of current and that\nindicates that the electron was in the spin up state. >> In this measurement phase, if you find\none of these spikes of current, it is because you had an electron spin up. So it can play catching a spin up or a spin\ndown event. You use, there was no current here. That was a spin down event. And try again. Again a spin down electron. Spin up electron. >> Now these researchers have actually gone\nfurther using the nucleus of the phosphorous atom as a qubit. Like an electron, the nucleus has a spin,\nalthough it is 2000 times weaker than the spin of the electron. But you can still write to it the same way\nusing electromagnetic radiation, only it needs to be a longer wavelength and a longer pulse\nin order to get the spin to flip. >> Because it is so small, so weakly magnetic\nand so perfectly isolated from the rest of the world, it is a qubit that lives for a\nvery long time. >> But how do you read out the spin of the\nnucleus? Well, you use the electron. Remember that the electron\u2019s frequency that\nit will respond to depends on the magnetic field that it is sitting in. >> So that magnetic field is the external\nmagnetic field that is produced by the super computing magnet, but there is also an internal\nmagnetic field coming from the nucleus. But that internal magnetic field can have\ntwo directions. Right? The nucleus can be pointing up or down itself. So what it means is that there are two frequencies\nat which the electron can respond, depending on the direction of the nucleus. >> So the nucleus actually acts as a little\nselector. It tells the electron, basically, which radio\nstation it can listen to. >> So what you are looking at now is an experiment\nwhere we actually flip the nucleus every five seconds. So for five seconds you will see that the\nelectron always responds, because the nucleus is always in the right direction to make the\nelectron respond to the frequency we are applying to the electron. And then for the other five seconds, the electron\nwill not respond, because we have flipped the nucleus the other way. So now watch. You see? >> So in this period of time the nucleus has\nbeen flipped down. >> Yeah. >> And now after five seconds it will flip\nup and then... >> Yeah, you see? >> And then the electron starts responding. >> Yeah. So you are watching on the oscilloscope screen\nin real time the measurement of the direction of a single nucleus and our ability to flip\nit at will every five seconds. >> The spin of the single nucleus. >> Nucleus. >> Now because all of this depends so sensitively\non magnetic fields, you need to make sure to eliminate all spin from the silicon crystal. But, unfortunately, natural silicon contains\nabout five percent the isotope silicon 29 and that does have a spin. >> But, in fact, the beauty of silicon is\nthat it has this isotope called silicon 28 that has no nuclear spin. The nuclear spin is zero. So it is a completely non magnetic atom. >> But where are you going to find a pure\ncrystal of silicon 28? Oh, wait. >> These isotopically purified silicon 28\ncrystals are being produced anyway for a purpose completely different from particle computing. They are being produced to redefine the kilogram\nthrough the Avogadro project. >> So the off cuts from that silicon sphere\nare actually being used as the home for qubits. That, I think, is incredible. There is no waste in this science. Hey, there.

They're being dumped\ninto this water reservoir in Los Angeles. And contrary to what you may have heard, their main purpose is not\nto reduce evaporation. So what are they really for? To find out, I'm visiting\nthe largest collection of these balls anywhere on earth, What? at LA Reservoir. (tranquil music) 96 million shade balls. - [Man 1] That's correct. (laughing) - 96 million. It's very rare to for you to\nsee 96 million of anything. - [Man 1] Yeah. (laughing) - This is your life vest which\nyou are required to wear. - All right. - Throw a leg over and\nclimb on in any way you can. (tranquil music) There you go. - [Narrator] Thank you. Looking at this, I had so many questions. Like, why are they black? Are they safe to have in drinking water? How much do they cost? Do they actually reduce evaporation? And, what is their real purpose? (boat engine roaring) Is that hard to drive in shade balls? - It is very hard. - Why is that? - 'Cause... (boat engine drowns James voice) - These are actually\npartially filled with water, and the reason they are\nfilled with water is that, at LA Reservoir we have\nsome really high winds and so, you know, if we didn't\nput water into these things, there would be balls down\nbouncing on the 5 Freeway, people drive down, they'd\nbe all over the place. So, these keep the balls in the reservoir and if they do start to roll, they kind of wobble because\nthe water makes them uneven. - [Narrator] But that\nmakes them significantly more difficult to push out of the way. Especially, when they form close packed crystal-like structures. Behind the boat, the balls\nquickly come together in our wake. And some close to the motor\nare pulled along with the boat. (boat engine stopping) Wow! (wind blowing) (laughing) What did you think, the\nfirst time they suggested doing this or when it first came in? - Yeah, it was a little out there. - [Narrator] Did you think they were nuts? - No, not nuts. - [Narrator] Well, it\njust, it like looks absurd. It's like we're in the\nworld's biggest ball pit. - Right, yeah, that's what it looks like. Yeah, you can't tell by standing here that we are actually floating over, I think it's probably, 40 feet right here, 40,\n50 feet deep below us, and you can't even seen any water. You'd think it was a joke, right? (laughing) If you didn't know, you'd go like, \"No you're not, that's (laughing) a green screen or something, right? Yeah, its fake.\" - So like, when I switch\non my tap at home, is the water coming from here? - [Hellen] Yes. - Sometimes or always? - [Hellen] Yes, most of the time. - Most of the time? - [Hellen] Yes. - Most of the time the\nwater is coming from here. - [Hellen] Correct, yes. - Absolutely nuts. So why is LA Reservoir\ncovered in shade balls? Well, the the problem\nall started with Bromide. - Bromide is a naturally\noccurring substance. It's associated with salt water and so normally places\nlike California Aqueduct, that comes down from the Delta. You get some some salt water intrusions, so you have some Bromide in the water. Bromide's harmless and it's\nalmost impossible to remove. But, when you disinfect\nthe water with Ozone, that Bromide becomes Bromate. And Bromate is carcinogenic. And so around the year\n2000 they wrote regulations regulating Bromate. And the regulation basically said, if you have a treatment\nplant that uses Ozone, then you have to watch\nyour Bromate formation. Be careful not to form too much. So, the only places we\never measured Bromate was at our filter plant. - [Narrator] And the results\nwere always within the 10 micrograms per liter\nlimit set by regulators. So they were confused when they got a call from one of their customers,\na beverage company in LA. - They said, \"We have\nsome really high levels of Bromate showing up,\nare you aware of this?\" And we said, \"Well, we\ndon't show anything.\" - [Narrator] But between\nthe filtration plant and the customer was the reservoir. So they did some tests. - Almost immediately upon coming into to this open reservoir, the Bromate levels jumped. It turned out that Bromide with Chlorine, which was supposed to be safe, in bright sunlight formed Bromate even more than Ozone did. And so we made the unfortunate\nscientific discovery that actually was not part\nof any regulatory scheme. And so, here we are at the reservoir, we have a water source that's\ngot Bromide in it, harmless, we have chlorine, we have to\nhave to disinfect the water and we have sunlight because it's open. The only choice we have\nis to remove sunlight. So, we looked at all sorts of things. We looked at floating\ntarps across the water, and normally, you put a\nfloating cover on the water but that's a multi-year project. And so we said, \"Well, can we manufacture these kind of trampoline\nwith poly-like PVC pipe?\" And we said, \"Well, they'll\njust gonna become bird perches and we'll have a big\nwater quality problem.\" Then we knew we had\nhigh-density polyethylene pipe, which is used in the water industry, and we know that it floats. We at one point thought about can we get float a pile of\npipe across the surface. Well, that's hard to do and very expensive 'cause it's a lot of material. So maybe we can take some pipe and we can run it through a chipper and we can make a debris\nfield across the surface, like the back corner of a lake somewhere. But, then you have all\nthis mushy, warm water with plastic floating on the top and that however sounds like a Petri dish. And so low and behold, Dr. Bryan White, did some research and\nhe found the shade ball. (tranquil music) - [Narrator] Except they\nweren't called shade balls at the time. (tranquil music) - This product existed and\nthey were called bird balls and they used it on ponds\nthat had mine tailings, where they didn't want waterfowl\nto go in and get poisoned. And also around airports\nwhere there are ponds and they want to keep the waterfowl off so they didn't take off\nand get into jet engines. (airplane engine roaring) You know they have actually\ndone wind tunnel testing and they blew, you know,\n50, 60 mile of winds across so they could see how they'd behave. But, they were really made\nto deter birds and wildlife from sitting on the water. - [Narrator] Did there used\nto be birds landing here more? - Absolutely, yes. - [Narrator] Yeah? - Yeah. Once we deployed these balls, all the birds were gone. They used to just hangout, right? Loiter at the curbs. - Yeah, they'd be all\nover the top of the dam. - [Hellen] You could see\nbirds dropping everywhere. - [James] They'd be down\nat the outlet tower, they'd be everywhere. We don't get 'em anymore like we used to. - [Narrator] But before\nbeing added to the reservoir, the shade balls had to be tested. Would they actually reduce\nthe formation of Bromate? - And we bought three kiddie pools, three little inflatable kiddie pools. And we filled them all\nwith the reservoir water. One was in the sunlight,\none we put a tarp on and one put shade balls on. And amazingly, the shade balls knocked out the problem immediately. - [Narrator] So the reason\nshade balls are black is to block all light\nfrom reaching the water and triggering the Bromate reaction. The black pigment is also safe for contact with drinking water and it's stable even exposed\nto the elements for years. - They're black for a reason so, you know, they're made out of a\nhigh-density polyethylene. It's the same material that like a gallon milk jug is made out of. It's a food grade plastic and they would be clear\nlike a milk carton, except that they wouldn't last in the sun. And so, they have a material\ncalled carbon black in them and that's what makes the plastic last for at least 10 years out in the sun. We did test to see if there is any other colors we could use. So we actually had the company make three different shades of blue, but the dyes were so unstable they said, \"We can't guarantee it's\ngonna last more than a year.\" And so, it's that carbon black that's the magic powder in this that really makes this\nproduct last in the sunlight. One of the concerns\nthat people raised to me when we put first these on, it was that, are they gonna get hot and\nthen bleach the material out? And they don't. They're totally inert. I mean, theoretically, you could cut off a piece of this ball\nand you could chew it, no harm comes to you. This is totally food grade, nothing wrong with it whatsoever. - [Narrator] What's it like\ndriving through these things? - It's difficult. As you can see we've\nbeen sitting here for, well, I don't know how\nlong, quite a while, and there's a breeze and we haven't moved. I mean anybody that knows, that's been on a boat in a lake, if there's a slight breeze\nand you're on a boat, you're drifting, right? Not here. This thing, they're just stable. They're (indistinct) It's interesting when\nyou try to pilot the boat through these things, its difficult. - [Narrator] It's like\ndriving through peanut butter or something? - Or something, I guess, yeah. Not that I've ever done that but... (laughing) - [Narrator] Blocking\nsunlight from the reservoir also provided additional benefits. - You know, one of the reasons\nwe put so much Chlorine was to control the algae growth. But sometimes you still\ncouldn't control it. There were times years ago, in the summer, where if we had an algae outbreak, you might actually, if\nyou filled a bath tub up, you might have a slight tinge of green. I mean, it maybe healthy to drink, but it might have a slight\ntinge of green from the algae. - [Narrator] You'd see a bit of algae. - Yeah, and it's just\ndiscoloring the water. That no longer occurs. So, with the sunlight gone, the algae problem is gone. We put in, basically, no Chlorine. We've only had a few times\nsince the shade balls have been on LA Reservoir, that we've added any Chlorine at all. And we used to do half the Chlorine and the whole water system went into that reservoir\njust to control algae growth. - [Narrator] But the big\nconcern I had was evaporation. When I first heard about\nthese black plastic balls reducing evaporation, it\ndidn't seem to make any sense. I mean, wouldn't they absorb more energy and so heat up the water,\nleading to faster evaporation? It turns out the answer is, no, for a number of reasons. In an open reservoir, there\nis more exposed surface area where water molecules\ncan escape into the air. Plus, there is greater air\nflow over the water's surface continually removing\nthe layer of moist air and replacing it with dryer\nair, increasing evaporation. Now the shade balls do absorb more energy and get hotter on top, but the bottom of the balls stays cool. Plus the balls mostly contain air, which is a good thermal insulator and so not much of the heat is transferred through to the water. - It's almost like a double-paned window, you know, you get that air gap in there and the air acts as an insulator, and so the sun never hits the water. Matter of fact, we've actually\ndone some measurements and it's actually cooler\nunder the shade balls, even though they're black, than it is without the balls, just with the sun itself. - [Narrator] Huh? - [Marty] So, the balls\nactually have a slight cooling effect. - [Narrator] So, for all of these reasons, shade balls reduce\nevaporation by 80 to 90%. That's pretty significant for a dry climate like Los Angeles. - [Narrator] How much do they cost? - These run about, around three for $1. I think we paid 33, 34 cents a piece, something in that range. And they actually will\nhave a salvage value, not that much, but if\nwe go to remove them, they are recyclable material. But we figured that over\nthe life of the balls, between the savings in chlorination, is chemical savings, and the savings in evaporation, probably at least half\nthe cost of the balls will be paid for. I mean, of course, the\nwater quality benefit is immeasurable, but even the balls\nthemselves will save money doing what they do. - [Narrator] Do you ever bring\npeople out here for tours? - You're the first one. (laughing) - [Narrator] Why am I the\nfirst one to get to go on a tour here? - To get this level of\ndetailed of tour, yes. - [Narrator] This is so cool! I've heard something\nabout hexagonal balls, have you heard anything\nabout hexagonal balls? - Oh, my gosh! So, we have the shade\nballs, and of course, everyone in the world came\nup with another product. I have ones I call se\nravioli, it's a small hex. We've got large hexes, we\nhave all sorts of pieces. And people said, \"Well,\nthey lock together.\" But the problem is, they\nneed to not stack up and they need to not sit on\nthe bank of the reservoir. The reservoir is gonna go up and down. And so it was really the shape of the ball that makes them not perch on the side because we need to make sure that these, when the water goes up and down, that they spread up, or they, you know, either spread out completely\nto cover the water as best possible. - [Narrator] I mean, I just\ncan't get over what I'm seeing, it's just so nuts. - I'm waiting for you to say\nit looks like a pool of boba. (laughing) - [Narrator] I feel like\nthat's the line that'll go in, but you got it. Like, that is, that's awesome. Do you like boba? - I love boba. (laughing) I might get some after this. (laughing) (techno sound) (boat engine roaring)","mXVGIb3bzHI":"I am going to scream as loud as I can and\nI am going to keep screaming as loud as I can while I spin around. I will keep going\nuntil my breath runs out. >> Great. >> You ready? >> Yeah. >> Ok [Screams] >> That was outstanding. Thank you. >> Thank you. >> The quietest place on earth is apparently\nan anechoic chamber in Minneapolis. Now I am here at BYU at their anechoic chamber.\nAnechoic is Latin and basically means no echo. And the way they achieve no echo is through\nall of these foam wedges which are put on the wall and even the floor. You can see\nthat I am actually on a spring floor and down below me there are all of these wedges. Now you may want to use headphones while you\nare listening to this video, because that is going to be quite important. >> Low frequency sound will come in and, by\nthe shape of it, bounce and just keep bouncing pretty much forever until it just gets lost\nin the wall. And then high frequencies are more so going to get absorbed into the foam\nitself. >> You can hear how the room deadens echoes\nby clapping constantly while closing the doors. [Clapping] It totally changes the quality of the sound.\n>> Definitely. >> There are reports that it is impossible\nto stay in one of these rooms and remain sane for a significant period of time. The record\nis apparently 45 minutes. >> I felt a little claustrophobic. And yet, it\nfelt like there is a lot of pressure on my head. >> But why would that be? I mean, the air\nis no different in here. >> What I figured is just because when you\nlisten in a normal room there is a lot of reverb. To your ear that means there is a\nlot of space, but there is none of that in here, so it feels claustrophobic. >> It feels like you are in a tiny room, like\nyou could be in a coffin. >>Yeah, maybe, yeah. >> I think it is really an anxiety response.\nSo you are used to having these sounds around you and then you don\u2019t anymore and so you\nstart to panic, because you don\u2019t have something you are used to, and I think that anxiety can\nincrease, cause some stress, and maybe that's why people go crazy or hallucinate with\nsound. It is just because they are trying to make up for what they are used to that\nisn\u2019t there. >> When I bring people in I warn them: Hey,\nif you get a little dizzy, please let me know, so I can get you out of the room before you\nmake a mess in our expensive facilities. >> First you will hear any rustle of your\nclothing. So you move an inch and you will hear it. Then you will hear any fluids that\nare in your mouth or your throat. You'll hear them all moving around every time you\nmove your mouth. And the longer you stay there the more you will hear. So you will start\nto hear the blood flow through your brain. >> Have you heard it? >> Yeah. It sounds kind of like a ringing\nor a pulsing. >> Can you kind of make the sound for us so\nthat we know what to listen in for? >> Of the blood flow? >> Yeah, like... >> It just sounds like a pulsing, like, shh,\nshh, shh. Some people say they can hear their heart\nbeat coming from their chest as well. >> Have you heard that? >> No. >> A violinist placed in one of these rooms\nwas apparently banging on the door within a matter of seconds trying to get out. Now\nthat people say it's impossible to stand up because you become so disoriented, dizzy, nauseous. And some people even hear oral hallucinations. But to me it doesn\u2019t sound right. You know,\nI believe that I should be able to sit in a room with no sound with the lights off for\nas long as I like. And so I am going to put myself to the test by staying in this room\nfor as long as I can. >> Have fun in silence. >> Thank you. Now it is just me in the anechoic chamber.\nAnd this is probably the quietest place I have ever been. And in a second I will tell the\nguys, shut the lights off. Ok, I think... Oh. I am ready. And the lights are off. I'm going \nto turn off the camera so I don\u2019t have this light and then there is only the\naudio recorder that I will keep with me. I'm not sure how long I have been in here,\nbut I still feel quite comfortable. It's nice and quiet. I mean, that is an understatement.\nBut it's relaxing. If I hear anything, I feel like I hear a low pitched hum. If I have to guess as to how long I have been\nin here I would say about eight minutes. I feel like I am more aware of my heart. I\ncan feel each pulse, and I can almost feel it radiating up my chest towards my head, like a wave. And in my ears there's a hiss. \nI think that is just... from hearing loss. This just reminds me of that Mission Impossible\nmovie where Tom Cruise sneaks into that building and he has to keep his decibel level low. [Quiet burp] That was a burp. I don\u2019t know if you could\nhear that. I can say the really small sounds seem amplified.\nIt is like your brain has recalibrated, so the quiet things seem much louder. I feel like I can feel more things like... with every beat of my heart it feels like... my body shakes a little bit... like a device that has\na little motor inside of it. How it gets shook around like a thumb. Ok, Cameron, looks to me like we are good\nfor time. If it looks the same to you like we are around 46 minutes or over, I am happy\nto hop out. So, yeah, when you are ready you could flip the lights back on if you like.\nAre you there? Hello? I think I have been in here for nearly\nan hour according to my time checks. And I didn\u2019t fall asleep, I just, you know,\nI have had a good time. It is a nice quiet space. I kind of feel like this would be a\ngood material to pad your bedroom in. Not a problem. Anechoic chamber, 45 minutes, an\nhour. Easy. I could stay in here for five hours. I think I could get a lot of work done\nin here. So now I just have to get out. And I am going\nto see if I can exit this room without them turning the lights on. Even the doors are nice and quiet. There we are.\nBack to the outside world. Hello, how are you doing?\n>> You alive? >> I am. I don't really understand how anyone could go crazy in there. I mean, quiet is kind of nice. But then again there are people who find all sorts of situations\nreally uncomfortable like just being in pitch black room or being in a small confined space.\nSo maybe those types of people would find this kind of unnerving. I definitely noticed that there were a lot\nof noises. Like it wasn\u2019t just pure silence. Like I actually have to work hard to make\nthings feel silent. Otherwise, you know, there was the sound of like me just rubbing my beard\nor just like the rustle of your clothes or every time you swallow or you breathe. Perhaps\nthe weirdest thing I noticed was like my sense of my heart. I just felt like it was pumping\nreally hard, and I could feel almost like the blood pushing up through me. It wasn\u2019t like\nI was hearing it. It was just like I was feeling it. And I was feeling it as though, in a way,\nmy heart was shaking my body. That was something weird. But besides that, nothing crazy, no weird hallucinations\nor anything like that. So I think the myth that you can\u2019t stay\nin here for longer than 45 minutes is busted, even though this is not Myth Busters. I still\nthink it is not true. Now if you really hate silence, you should\nalways carry an audio book around with you. And I can recommend a good one: The Fault\nin our Stars by my friend John Green.

This you are looking at\nnow is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure it's the roundest\nobject? I mean the Earth is pretty round, isn't it?\nIf this was the Earth... If this were the Earth then the highest mountain\nto the lowest valley would be... about 14m apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest one million Euros\nand thousands of man-hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather 'grave'\nas it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see the grave was the original name for\nthe base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Systeme International d'unites\nor SI units. In 1793, a commision which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier,\ndefined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting\ntemperature of ice -- essentially just a litre of ice water. The name grave came from the\nLatin gravitas, meaning weight. But it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar\nto the aristocratic title 'graf' -- which is the equivalent of an earl or a count. And\nwith the French revolution in full swing with the rallying cry of equality for all, you\ncouldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this Lavoisier lost his head,\nliterally, not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of\nall time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grave\nwould be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway and and so they settled\non the gramme, which was just a thousandth of the grave. But soon they realized that a gram was too\nsmall and so they returned to the grave, but since they couldn't call it that, they invented\nthe kilogram -- a thousand grams. And that is why out of the seven base SI units, the\nkilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799 the kilogram definition was refined\nto be the mass of a litre of water at 4 degrees Celcius -- the temperature at which it is\ndensest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard.\nSo a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition\nand it was declared Kilogram of the Archives. Now it's important to note at this point the\nkilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water -- the kilogram of the archives\nis by definition THE kilogram. 90 years later, in 1889 the kilogram was upgraded\nto a platinum-iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original but was\notherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram.\nIt is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately\nknown as Le Grand K -- or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big... It is the only thing in the entire universe\nwith a mass of exactly one kilogram because it IS the kilogram. It is also the only SI\nunit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars, next to six\nsister kilograms, in a climate-controlled vault locked by three independently controlled\nkeys, in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts\nof Paris. Now if you were able to break into the vault\nand tamper with Big K, you would be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition\non which many of our measurements rely, and so you would throw the world into chaos! Well\nno, not actually-- but how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well when it was first created, 40 identical\nreplicas were also made. Well they weren't quite identical - they had a mass which was\nslightly different to Big K but those offsets were recorded. Now these replicas were sent\nout to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948 the kilograms were reunited for a\nweigh-in. And this is when the problems started. Because even though all the cylinders were\nmade of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged\nover time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with\nit. And to make matters worse when they were brought together again forty years later,\ntheir masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms - that's about the weight of\na fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits since the kilograms were carefully\nwashed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually\nchanged the mass of the cylinders, but how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation.\nOne this is for certain, the mass of a platinum-iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this\nis a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value.\nAnd the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass since of the seven base SI units,\nfour of them depend on the mass of the kilogram, not to mention all the derived units like\nNewtons, Joules, Volts and Watts. At this point those of you in countries that\nhave not adopted the metric system--yes I'm speaking to you Liberia, Burma, and the US--you\nmay be feeling rather smug that your unit of mass, the avoirdupois pound, is no longer\ndefined by a physical object. No, instead it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms. Sucked in. So clearly something needs to be done to eliminate\nthe kilogram's dependence on a physical object and this is where the silicon sphere comes\nin, but how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object and it's beautiful\nbut you know it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that.\nWe're trying to get away from the physical object but what we're doing with this particular\nobject is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there\ncan you? You can't count how many are in there but\nyou can calculate how many are in there because this material is silicon, there's no voids\nor dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon.\nThat's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only\none isotope of silicon, silicon-28, and that explains why the original material was so\nexpensive. And why a sphere?\nWell, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere you\ncan characterise the entire dimension of the object.\nWell that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created, but how\ndo you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere.\nSo it was about two millimetres larger in diameter and then we just grind it progressively\nfiner and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level\nof trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level.\nBut making the sphere is only half the battle, then you need to accurately measure its diameter.\nThe diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere\nin the centre of a cavity and a laser is hitting both sides and you're actually measuring the\ngap. By knowing the diameter you can determine\nits volume. And since the atom spacing in silicon is known to high precision, you can\nthe calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant.\nAt the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the\nnumber of atoms in twelve grams of carbon 12. But using this approach, the number of\nsilicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then\ndefine the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or\ndamaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram because it would be defined\nnot by a physical object but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition\nof the kilogram say \"a kilogram is the mass of 2.15x10^25 silicon-28 atoms\"\nYes. Is it - is it going to happen?\nThere's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen.\nBut there is another approach to redefining the kilogram which involves fixing Planck's\nconstant and it's done using something called a Watt Balance. These two approaches are complimentary.\nEach one provides a check on the other, and if they show good agreement and are able to\nbring their uncertainties down to about twenty micrograms they may redefine the kilogram\nas early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined\nby a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris.\nNow if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a litre of water at its\ndensest temperature then how well did we do? Well if you look at a litre of water at nearly\nfour degrees Celcius it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two\nways. On the one hand you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be, but\non the other hand 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct\nwithin the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want\nto hear more about the Watt Balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I\ncan do. It does seem to be the frontrunner in terms of redefining the kilogram, so we\nwill have to wait and see what happens. One last thing, I should point out that it took\nan international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere but don't you\nthink that the scientist who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some\nof the credit. Well in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been\ninvolved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish or from cradle to grave.","GeyDf4ooPdo":"I am here at the University of Sydney where\nthe mechanical engineering shop has built this incredible piece of apparatus for me. It is a forty pound, that is nineteen kilogram\nflywheel on the end of a meter long shaft. Can you imagine trying to hold this out horizontally\nwith just one hand at this end? It is virtually... it is impossible, ok? No I'm going to let go. You going to be able to hold this at all? I hope so. Can you lift it out? Make it horizontal - hold it, hold it, hold\nit. Come on. Just try to - I want you to hold it out horizontal. See if you can. Hold it, hold it! Ahh, come on! No. What I'm going to do is I am going to spin\nthis up to a few thousand RPM and then I'm going to attempt just that, to hold it from\none end and have it out horizontally. Five, four, three, two, one. Boom. I'm going to let go with my left hand. What you'll see is that the shaft remains\nhorizontal, see it going around there. It almost looks as though the wheel is weightless. How does this work? Well instead of pulling the wheel down to\nthe ground as you'd expect, the weight of the wheel creates a torque which pushes it\naround in a circle. You may recognise this as gyroscopic precession. For a more detailed explanation, click the\nannotation, or the link in the description to see my video on the topic. Here I want to try something more extreme. I'm going to try to lift it over my head with\none hand while it's spinning. Wish me luck. But before I make the attempt, Rod wisely\nsuggests that I first check if I can lift the wheel above my head without it spinning. OK, let's prove that I could lift it, just\nthis end, without it spinning. Here we go. agggh\nI mean it's just kind of awkward with the hand. Careful! Ah, che\nCareful! Ha\nOooohhh Just barely. Oh goodness, do you even lift? Clearly I do not. Undaunted by my lack of strength, I'm going\nfor it, but I want to make sure the wheel is spinning as fast as possible to give me\nthe best chance of success. Give it ten more seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,\nthree, two, one. Pull! Go. That was perfect. Now I'm going to release my left hand and\nholding only with my right hand at the end of the shaft, I'll try to lift it up over\nmy head. This is a forty pound, nineteen kilogram flywheel. Ready? Here we go: three, two, one. Beautiful! Let's go again in three, two, one. Nice! Smooth. Three, two, one. It feels incredibly, incredibly light as I\ndo that. When you said it felt incredibly light,\nyeah you mean when you're lifting it feels light? Yeah. It shouldn't! I know. Hahahaha\nHonestly, I have lifted it up with one hand when it's not spinning. Yeah. And it feels really hard to lift it up, like\nit's a big effort. Yeah. But with this, when it's spinning it honestly\nfelt like it was just... wanting to go up by itself. Yes. It felt like I was not struggling like I was\nnot putting in the amount of force that you'd think to lift that kind of weight. I bet if you let it go, it'd crash down to\nthe ground. It's not weightless! We can't do that though. We can't do that part of the experiment. What we could maybe do is I could stand on\na scale and we could see what the weight of me plus that apparatus does, while I'm lifting\nit up over my head, see if I get lighter in essence. You can see that just my weight is about 72\nkilograms. Now when I pick up the flywheel it goes up\nto about 91 kilograms, which makes sense because the flywheel itself is about 19 kilos, that's\nabout 42 pounds. Now we're going to spin it up and I want you\nto make a prediction. As I'm lifting it over my head, do you think\nthe scale reading will be more, less than, or equal to 91 kilograms. What do you think? You can make your prediction by clicking on\none of the on-screen annotations or if you're on mobile you can click a link in the description. Five, four, three, two, one.","AeJ9q45PfD0":"This is aerogel.\nThe world's lightest, that is least dense, solid. This piece has a mass of just 1.22 grams. That is only a few times the mass of the same volume of air, which kind of makes sense because it is 99.8% air. In fact, some aerogels are so light that if you removed all the air from them, they would be less dense than air. I have long been fascinated by aerogel so I actually flew out to Aerogel Technologies in Boston to find out why was aerogel invented. How is it made? Why is it such a good thermal insulator and what is it used for? - Okay, we are going to try an experiment to demonstrate the insulating power of aerogel so over here we have two setups: one with a glass petri dish, and the other one with aerogel on top. - Both are made of silica, but with very different physical structures. We're gonna see how long it takes to melt these chocolate bunnies with a Bunsen burner. - Now to have a look at this experiment, we have a FLIR T1020 which can see temperatures up to 2,000 degrees Celsius. - Looks like it's getting pretty hot. - Yeah, you can see that the glass is getting really hot already. And after just a minute: - It's starting to smoke.\n- Okay. - It's definitely melting and smoking. Oh, yeah, here we go. I would say that's phase change. - We've got a liquid chocolate situation. We have some smoking bunny. Over here, the bunny is actually sort of melting over, and look, there, it's sort of tilting to the side. - Alright, I think we're going to call that a melt. - What is that?\n- Oh! On cue, on cue. [Laughs.] - I would say that is material fail. - Not only did the bunny melt quickly, the petri dish cracked under the thermal expansion. - Wanna pop it in? - So now let's try the aerogel. [Music]\n- So how is aerogel invented back in? - Back in 1931, a guy named Professor Samuel Kistler had a bet with his colleague Charles Learned. - Now the bet revolved around jellies,\nlike peanut-butter-and-jelly jellies. Now the thing about jellies is they are actually a combination of liquids and solids. [Music] I mean, they're mostly liquid,\nbut it's embedded within this 3D solid structure. - So if you think of a gel, like jello, has a skeleton with nano-sized pores that gives it its rigidity, and then that's about 1% of the gel. - So the bet was this: Could you remove the liquid from the jelly? Without affecting the solid structure?\nI mean, if you just evaporate the liquid out, well, then the solid structure shrinks, because as you remove liquid molecules, they pull on each other, and they pull on the solid structure around them, basically crumpling it from the inside. Now Samuel Kistler solved this problem in two ways. First, he realized you could replace one liquid with another inside the jelly just by washing it thoroughly. So you could swap out, say, water, for alcohol. And then, if you take the jelly and put it in a high-pressure vessel called a autoclave, - By heating it to the high-temperature, high-pressure point called the critical point of the liquid, that liquid transformed into a semi-liquid, semi-gas called a supercritical fluid. - At this point, there is no longer a distinction between liquid and gas. Those molecules are no longer pulling on each other. - So once you've depressurized the vessel, that solid skeleton, that 1% of the mass of the gel, is left behind intact, except for where there was liquid in the pores before is now gas, and that solid skeleton, that nanoporous solid is what we call aerogel. - Kistler published his findings in Nature in 1931. It is getting pretty hot as you can see through the thermal camera. But coming up on three minutes, there's still no sign of melted chocolate. So we're gonna pull out a thermocouple and just check the temperature underneath the bunny. Like, underneath the aerogel, and see what, what the flame temperature is. You can kind of see that, that parts of the bunny are getting hot, but it's not the bottom of the bunny, It's all the, around the bunny. - Exactly. That convective heat is moving up and around the aerogel, - So you can see the thing is getting red hot.\n- And by four minutes, the bunny is looking a little soft. - Still pretty good though, considering how easy it is to melt chocolate. - Can I put my finger here? - Be careful. It's not that it's hot, it's that it's brittle.\n- Right. - But yeah, totally cool to touch, right?\n- It is, it is just warm to the touch. - He made aerogels out of all sorts of things. He made them out of eggs.\nHe made them out of rubber, out of nitrocellulose. And, included in there was silica. Actually right here on the table, I have some examples of some silica gels. This is a, a wet silica gel It's kind of rubbery so I can just,\nyou know, carve out a piece. It is 97% alcohol inside of its pores. And then the remaining 3% solid is amorphous silica. Just-- - Can I touch it?\n- Yeah, absolutely. It's kind of rubbery. Not that strong. - So was I cracking it there or was it already kinda cracked? - Yeah, you just, no--\n- Oh whoa, it's very easy to break. Very crumbly. - The next step is to replace the alcohol in the gel with liquid carbon dioxide. - We're about to see liquid CO\u2082. - Liquid CO\u2082 has the advantage of being non-flammable, plus it's got a low critical temperature. - Open it up, and--\n- Yeah, I see it flooding in there. - Yeah, it's flooding in. There it goes.\nJust another solvent. [Vibration.] - You can clearly see that it's so much cooler on top. - What temperature is it on the bottom?\n- We're at 600 right now? - 600 degrees Celsius.\n- 600 degrees Celsius, that's 1250 Fahrenheit right now. - Notice where the bunny is melting. It's melting right on that edge where the heat's, like, the flame is kind of crawling up and over. - So, yeah, that's - Oh! Bunny down! [Laughs.] - Well, not a bad result.\n- Not a bad result at all. - I'm interested in in tasting some of this chocolate here. ( - Gross.) - Is it hot? - It's warm. \n- Warm. - And delicious.\n- Like fondue. - Mm-hmm. That was great. Once the liquid CO\u2082 has filled all the pores of the gel, it's time to take it supercritical. - It was, I would say, a kind of a spiritual experience the first time that I saw a supercritical fluid. - We'll get to that here. - [Laughs.] I love how much you're into these autoclaves.\n- I love aerogels. To make a supercritical fluid, we can heat this with a hairdryer actually. [Hairdryer blows.] As we approach the critical point, the surface of the liquid becomes kind of blurry. - Weird, huh? - That is like weird waves in there, yeah. I'll speed it up so you can watch the surface disappear altogether. You're now looking at the supercritical fluid of CO\u2082. In this state, the CO\u2082 can be vented without affecting the solid structure, and what you're left with is aerogel. \u266b - If you look at aerogel on a light background, it's almost impossible to see,\nbecause it is pretty transparent. But if you look at it on a darker background, then you can see that it has a slight bluish color. And, it's bluish for the same reason that the sky is blue, because all those tiny little nanoscale structures, they scatter the light according to Rayleigh scattering. And, the intensity of light scattered is proportional to\n1 over wavelength to the power of 4, which means it scatters shorter wavelengths, like blue, much more than it scatters yellow or red. And, for that reason, aerogel looks opaque in the ultraviolet and transparent in the infrared. - Now, what do you think this would look like\nif I held it up to the blue sky? What do you think we would see?\nWould it look ultra blue? No, it looks yellow. And that's because the aerogel is actually scattering out that blue light, and so what passes through and makes it to our eyes is the longer wavelengths like the yellows and oranges. It's basically the same effect as looking at a sunset When you see the yellows and oranges of a sunset, it's because the blue light\nhas already been scattered out by the atmosphere the light had to pass through\nbefore it reached your eyes. So effectively looking at aerogel against blue sky\nis like looking at a portable sunset. The nanoscale pores of the aerogel are also what makes it such a good thermal insulator. ( - Three.) - That's awesome. - Does that look hot?\n- It's definitely hot. - You might think that because aerogel is largely comprised of air, like 99% air, that it has the same thermal properties as air,\nbut that is not correct. It's actually a better insulator than air is. - That's because the width of the pores is smaller than the distance air molecules travel on average before colliding with something. Their so-called mean free path. Hence, it's really difficult for the hot, fast-moving air molecules below the aerogel to diffuse through it and transfer heat to the top of the aerogel. This is called the Knudsen effect.\n- It is so weird because you know, you don't expect something that's transparent to block the heat that well, but this really does. - And that's why NASA used aerogel insulation on the Sojourner Rover, Spirit and Opportunity, the Curiosity Rover, and they plan to use it on future missions to Mars. - Why does it need insulation?\n- The electronics, because they don't want the electronics to get cold during the cold nights on Mars - NASA has also put aerogel to more exotic uses, notably to catch dust from a comet\nas part of the Stardust mission. - So the particles were traveling about six kilometers per second relative to the aerogel So when they hit the aerogel, because the aerogel's\na very low density material, very, very porous material, the particles actually enter the aerogel,\nand as they travel through the aerogel, they basically break apart the network that makes up the aerogel and they lose energy in the process and eventually come to a stop. This is good for capturing particles, because if a particle like that were to hit a solid surface then it just stops, you know, immediately. - It just vaporizes.\n- And vaporizes. - So should we expect to see aerogel in our everyday lives anytime soon? - One of my running jokes is when they build skyscrapers in Antarctica, they'll use aerogel as thermal insulation. [Both laugh.] - Why do you say that? - Well, because then they'll really care about how, just how thermal efficient it is\nbecause it would be so cold there. - Right. - So instead of having, you know, ten feet of fiberglass insulation, you could have six inches or something of aerogel. - Scientists are currently working on reducing costs and increasing durability. - And that's true. They do have some elasticity.\n- Okay. - Yeah, so there we go. So it is not hard to break. - They've already made a lot of progress.\nFor example, original silica aerogel is hydrophilic. - There we go. Now this is a hydrophilic aerogel. - So once we've done this, is that piece of aerogel ruined now? - Pretty much. - But there are ways to make it waterproof. So if you want to see that and all the other next generation aerogels, then subscribe to the channel and this may be the start of an aerogel trilogy. \u266b [Subtitles credits: \u96dc\u788e Chop Suey, ]\n[Translation credits: ]","2OSrvzNW9FE":"Recently some friends of mine went to the Gordon Dam in Tasmania, which is 126.5 meters (or 415 feet) high. Then they dropped a basketball over the edge. You can see that the basketball gets pushed around a bit by the breeze, but it lands basically right below where it was dropped. Now watch what happens when they drop another basketball, but this time with a bit of backspin... \"Woah,  look at that go!\" \"That's incredible.\" \"This is Bret who just threw it.\" I litterally just dropped it, with a bit of spin, like I didn't even throw it, and it just took off, like we had no idea that was gonna do that. And this is where I come in: the basketball was subject to the Magnus effect, which affects all rotating balls or cylinders as they fly through the air. And it works like this: as the basketball picks up speed, air on the front side of the ball is going in the same direction as its spin, and therefore it gets dragged along with the ball and deflected back. Air on the other side is moving opposite to the ball spin, so the flow separates from the ball instead of getting deflected. The net result is the ball pushes air one way, so the air applies an equal force on the ball the other way. And this is known as the Magnus effect, named after Heinrich Gustav Magnus who described it in 1852. Of course, Isaac Newton beat him to it by nearly two hundred years, describing the flight of tennis balls at Cambridge College. But, you know, he's got enough stuff named after him.... This effect is very important in sports like tennis, soccer and golf, but could it have non-sport applications? Perhaps. This is a sailboat. I know it doesn't look like a sailboat, but those aren't chimneys. They are spinning cylinders called \"Flettner rotors\", and they take the place of the sails. They deflect crosswinds, using the Magnus effect, to propel the ship forwards. And this is a plane with spinning cylinders instead of wings. Using the Magnus effect, the cylinders actually generate more lift than traditional wings. However they also generate way more drag, making them impractical. This place only flew once, and then it crashed. But the Magnus effect is making a comeback. Here is an experimental rotor wing aircraft which generates all its lift from spinning cylinders. And this is the E-Ship 1 which uses four spinning cylinders (that's four Flettner rotors) to increase its efficiency and reduce the amount of diesel it burns. So, in the future, the Magnus effect may help more than just basketballs fly. \"Woah, look at that go!\" Now the real reason my friends from \"How Ridiculous\" were at the dam was to set the world record for the highest basket ever scored.

What's really cool\nis to play some sounds into the tube, and you can actually set up standing waves. That\nis, there are areas, there are patterns of the vibration of the air where there's a lot\nof vibration in some parts, and not very much vibration in other parts. Now, that affects\nthe flow rate of the gas inside that tube into the atmosphere, and so it affects the\nheight of those flames. So basically, you can visualize the standing wave pattern. I'm\ncurrently in Denmark with a team of physics and chemistry demonstrators who have taken\nthis experiment to the next level.

You can\ngo to this link, right here. - Go check it out if you want to see more\nof what these guys are up to. It's awesome. - [Sune] It's great. - Ahoy. That is the actual Czech word for\nhello. I have made it to Olomouc in the Czech Republic, and this is partly thanks to support\nfrom Audible.com, the leading provider of audio books, with over 150,000 titles in all\nareas of literature, including fiction, non-fiction, and periodicals. Now, today I wanted to recommend\na book, which is a little bit European, and it's called Galileo's Daughter by Dava Sobel.\nI love this book because it includes the actual letters written from Galileo's daughter to\nhim during his life, and it really reveals what he must have gone through as a human\nbeing. We all know about his science, and about the trials that he went through, but\nto see this kind of insight into his personal life, I think is remarkable, so you should\nreally check out this book, and you can download it for free by going to audible.com\/veritasium,\nor you can pick any other book of your choosing for a one month free trial. So I really want\nto thank Audible for supporting me, and allowing me to go and meet great scientists, and filmmakers,\nand lots of people all around the world. Also, I should note that I will be hosting Michio\nKaku in Brisbane and Melbourne on June 5th and 6th. Links in the doobly-doo. I would\nlove to see you there. Thank you so much for watching, and I will see you somewhere else\nin the world. Bye.","oVfHeWTKjag":"Have you heard of Virtual Bagel? Their Facebook\npage has over 4,000 likes. They use the page to promote their brilliant\nbusiness model 'we send you bagels via the Internet -- just download and enjoy.' It sounds like a joke, and it is, sort of.\nThis page was set up by BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones in 2012. He wanted to find out what is the worth of\na like on a Facebook page, so he bought some likes for Virtual Bagel. Now there are two\nways to buy 'likes', the legitimate way and the illegitimate way. The illegitimate way is to go to a website\nlike BoostLikes.com purchase some likes. You can get 1000 for $70. Sites like these use clickfarms in developing\ncountries like India, the Philippines, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Indonesia and Bangladesh. Here employees are routinely paid just 1 dollar\nper thousand clicks of the like button. So Facebook explicitly forbids buying likes\nthis way. Instead they offer the 'legitimate' way to\npay for likes by advertising your page. Prominently displayed is a link to \"Get more likes\" with\nthe promise: \"Connect with more of the people who matter to you.\" And this is how Virtual Bagel got its 4000\nlikes. Rory Cellan-Jones paid 100 dollars to Facebook and the likes rolled in. He targeted\nhis ad to the UK and the United States, but also to countries like Egypt, Indonesia and\nthe Philippines. Now where do you think Virtual Bagel was most popular? I'll give you a hint,\nit wasn't the US or the UK. But within a day he had over 1600 likes mostly from developing\ncountries. Now what was more problematic was the people\nwho followed Virtual Bagel looked suspicious. For example there was one Cairo-based follower\nwhose name was Ahmed Ronaldo. His profile consisted almost exclusively of\npictures of Cristiano Ronaldo and he liked 3,000 pages. Cellan-Jones also observed that his new throng\nof fans was particularly disengaged, just as you'd imagine those from a click-farm would\nbe. But he hadn't hired a click-farm, he had paid for Facebook ads. This story was reported in July 2012. In August,\nFacebook reported it had identified and deleted 83 million fake accounts (that was 9% of the\ntotal at the time). This resulted in noticeable drops for popular singers and celebrities. So did they delete all of the fake likes?\nNope, not even close. I know because most of the likes on my Facebook page are not genuine. In May 2012, I received a number of emails\nfrom Facebook offering me $50 worth of free promotion of my page, which at the time had\nonly 2,000 likes. My YouTube channel had twenty times that following\nso I thought surely this free 'paid' promotion could help me reach more of the people who\nmattered to me. And immediately I could see results. Within just a few days my likes had\ntripled, and they kept on growing, thousands per day. And after a few months I had about 70,000\nFacebook likes, which matched my YouTube subscribers at the time. Now what was weird was my posts\non Facebook didn't seem to be getting any more engagement than when I had 2,000. If\nanything, they were getting less engagement. I didn't understand why at the time, but I\nhave since realized it's because most of those likes I was gaining through Facebook ads were\nnot from people who were genuinely interested in Veritasium. How do I know? Well because\nfake likes behave very differently from real followers. Have a look at this graph of the engagement\nof my Facebook followers. Here I'm plotting countries as bubbles, so this is Canada and\nthe size represents the number of likes I've received from that country. So this is the\nUnited States, it's a nice big bubble. Now I'm ranking these countries on the horizontal\naxis based on what percentage of those likes have engaged with my page this month. So as\nyou can see roughly 30% Canadians and Americans have engaged with my page, but they're not\nas active as the Germans where over 40% of my likes have engaged, and they are not as\nactive as the Austrians a small but passionate group of Veritasium fans at nearly 60% These are all of the other Western countries.\nSo you can see that it's common for between 25% and 35% of my page likes to engage with\nmy page every month. Now here is Egypt, where less than 1% of my\nlikes have engaged with my page. Now this is India, the Philippines, Pakistan, Bangladesh,\nIndonesia, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. That's a big followings, but no engagement.\nTogether all of these countries make up 80,000 likes, that's roughly 75% of the total likes\nI had before the last video. And these are the profiles that followed me when I used\nFacebook advertising. And they are worse than useless. Here's why: When you make a post, Facebook distributes\nit to a small fraction of the people who like your page just to gauge their reaction.\nIf they engage with it by liking, commenting, and sharing then Facebook distributes the\npost to more of your likes and even their friends.\nNow if you somehow accumulate fake likes, Facebook's initial distribution goes out to\nfewer real fans, and therefore it receives less engagement, and so consequently you reach\na smaller number of people. That's how a rising number of fans can result in a drop in engagement. And from this Facebook makes money twice over\n-- once to help you acquire new fans, and then again when you try to reach them. I mean\nyour organic reach may be so restricted by the lack of engagement, that your only option\nis to pay to promote the post. What's worse, there is no way to delete fake\nlikes in bulk -- all you can do is target posts around them. And I should re-iterate I never bought fake\nlikes. I used Facebook's legitimate advertising, but the results are as if I had paid for fake\nlikes from a clickfarm. Now you might think the solution to all this\nis just to exclude countries with click-farms from your ad campaigns. But unfortunately\nthe problem goes much deeper. Meet Virtual Cat, a virtual pet like none\nother. Its page is committed to supplying only the\nworst, most annoying drivel you can imagine. Only an idiot would like this page. And that's\nnot just my opinion, that's actually what it says in the page description. And I should know because I wrote it. I created\nthis page yesterday and I then paid $10 to advertise the page through Facebook targeted\nonly to cat-lovers in the United States, Canada, Australia and the UK. Now I expected that\nbecause I had excluded all of the big click-farm countries and because the page is so terrible\nthat I basically wouldn't get any likes. But within 20 minutes I had blown through my whole\nbudget and I got 39 likes. So who are these people liking a blank page and costing me\n25 cents a piece? All of the profiles were all from the places\nI had targeted, mostly the US, but there was something strange about them. All of these\npeople liked a LOT of things, like hundreds and thousands things. And a lot of the things they liked were odd\ntoo. Like in one account this person liked T-mobile, AT&T and Verizon. They liked Jeep\nand Lexus and Mercedes and Volvo and Volkswagon. They like everything. Other accounts I saw,\nthey liked kitchen scrubbers and they liked mouthwash. Who reports that on their Facebook\npage? It just baffles me. So the real mystery to me is why someone,\nsomewhere would click on ads they didn't care about without making money from them. I mean\nI don't think these likes came from bots - they are too easy to identify and eliminate. And\nI also don't think for a second Facebook would pay click-farms to click on those ads to generate\nrevenue for them, so it really seems like a mystery. And then, in this article I found what I think\nis the most reasonable hypothesis. Click-farms click the ads for free. In order\nto avoid detection by Facebook's fraud algorithms, they like pages other than the ones they've\nbeen paid for to seem more genuine. I mean you can imagine 1000 likes on a particular\npage coming from one geographic area in a short period of time would seem suspicious.\nBut buried in a torrent of other 'like' activity? They would be impossible to identify. So workers at these click-farms will literally\nclick anything. I mean where do you think Facebook's Security page is most popular?\nDhaka, Bangladesh. What about Google? Dhaka. What about soccer star David Beckham? It's\nactually Cairo, but you take my point. So wherever you're targeting, advertising\nyour page on Facebook is a waste of money. I wish Facebook would remove the fake likes\nfrom my page and all the others. But that would mean admitting that they have generated\nsignificant ad revenue from clicks that weren't genuine, which then suppressed the reach of\npages who had low engagement, forcing those pages to pay again to reach inauthentic fans.\nSo the truth is Facebook benefits by maintaining this status quo because the reality is nobody\nlikes this many things.","BickMFHAZR0":"Sometimes the simplest questions have the\nmost amazing answers. Like how can trees be so tall?\nIt's a question that doesn't even seem like it needs an answer. Trees just are tall.\nSome of them are over 100 meters. Why should there be a height limit? I'll tell you why. Tress need to transport\nwater from their roots up into their topmost branches in order to survive. And that is\nno trivial task. There is a limit to the height that water\ncan be sucked up a tube - it's 10 meters. If you suck on a long vertical straw, the\nwater will go no higher than 10 meters. At this point there will be a perfect vacuum\nat the top of the straw and the water will start to boil spontaneously. For a tree to\nraise water 100 meters, it would have to create a pressure difference of 10 atmospheres. How would trees do that? When I posed this conundrum, a lot of people\nsaid the answer is transpiration. And that's when water evaporates from the leaf, pulling\nup the water molecules behind it. Now that's clearly a mechanism a tree can use to create\nsuction, but it doesn't help us overcome this 10 meter limit.\nThe lowest the pressure can go is a pure vacuum, which I imagine is not happening inside of\ntree leaves, right? Right, Hank. So you might suspect that a tree\ndoes not contain continuous straw-like tubes The tree effectively has valves in it. So\nyou don't have a column of water This big tube that you're saying needs to\nbe full of water is actually made up of cells. Although these are good speculations, they\ndon't turn out to be correct. Scientists who study trees find that the xylem\ntubes that transport water do contain a continuous water column. So how else could the tree transport\nwater from the roots to the leaves? They don't suck, they don't use a vacuum. OK, so how do they do it? Squeezing like a cow udder all the way up.\nThey have little tree muscles in there. Yeah.\nBesides being a giant waste of energy, all of the cells that make up the xylem tubes\nare all dead. What about osmotic pressure? If there is more\nsolute in the roots than in the surrounding soil, water would be pushed up the tree. But\nsome trees live in mangroves, where the water is so salty that osmotic pressure actually\nacts in the other direction so the tree needs additional pressure to suck water into the\ntree. Then it must be capillary action. The thinner\nthe tube, the higher the water can climb. But the tubes in a tree are too wide - at\n20-200 micrometers in diameter, water should rise less than a meter. So how do trees do it? Well one of the assumptions we made is wrong:\nThe lowest the pressure can go is a pure vacuum pure vacuum\npure vacuum In a gas, this is true. When you eliminate\nall of the gas molecules, the pressure is zero and you have a perfect vacuum. But in a liquid, you can go lower than 0 pressure\nand actually get negative pressures. In a solid, we would think of this as tension.\nThis means that the molecules are pulling on each other and their surroundings. As the water evaporates from the pores of\nthe cell wall, they create immense negative pressures of -15 atmospheres in an average\ntree. Think about the air-water interface at the pore. There is one atmosphere of pressure\npushing in and negative 15 atmospheres of suction on the other side. So why doesn't\nthe meniscus break? Because the pores are tiny, only 2-5 nanometres in diameter. At\nthis scale, water's high surface tension ensures the air-water boundary can withstand huge\npressures without caving. As you move down the tree, the pressure increases,\nup to atmospheric at the roots. So you can have a large pressure difference between the\ntop and bottom of the tree because the pressure at the top is so negative. But hang on, if the pressure near the top\nis negative 15 atmospheres, shouldn't the water be boiling? Yes. Yes it should. But changing phase from liquid to gas requires\nactivation energy. And that can come in the form of a nucleation site like a tiny air\nbubble. That's why it's so important that the xylem tubes contain no air bubbles, and\nthey can do this because unlike a straw, they have been water-filled from the start. This\nway, water remains in the metastable liquid state when it really should be boiling. It's just like supercooled water remains liquid\nwhen it really should be ice. So you could say that the water in a tree is supersucked\nbecause it remains liquid at such negative pressures. And why are trees moving all this water up\nthe tree? I want you to make a guess, say it out loud.\nFor photosynthesis? Actually, no. Less than 1% of the water is\nused in photosynthetic reactions. Any other ideas?\nOk what about growth? Well 5% of the water is used to make new cells.\nWell, so then what happens to the other 95% of the water?\nIt just evaporates. For each molecule of carbon dioxide a tree\ntakes in, it loses hundreds of water molecules of water. Woah. Can you believe how amazing this is? Trees\ncreate huge negative pressures of 10's of atmospheres, by evaporating water through\nnanoscale pores, sucking water up 100m, in a state where it should be boiling but can't\nbecause of the perfect xylem tubes contain no air bubbles, just so that most of it can\nevaporate in the process of absorbing a couple molecules of carbon dioxide. I will never look at a tree the same way again. I'd like to say a huge thank you to Hank,\nHenry and Professor Poliakoff for making on camera hypotheses. This is an essential part\nof the scientific process even if your hypothesis turns out to be wrong.\nAs Einstein said, \"a person who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.\"\nI've always wondered what it would be like to be on this side of a Veritasium video. Now I'd be surprised if you weren't already\nsubscribed to these guys, but if you're not, go click on these annotations and check out\ntheir channels. You may just learn something. I'd also like to thank Professor John Sperry\nfrom the University of Utah. He walked me through all of this in an hour-long Skype\nconversation so I'm going to put a link to his website in the description.\nWe're looking at pressures here below atmospheric, is that right?\nThat's right. Below atmospheric. This is liquid pressure not gas pressure. So it's a common\nmisconception that oh, you can't have you know negative pressures because there's no\nmolecules left. You know, the definition of pure vacuum is zero molecules. That's for\na gas, ok. So just to be clear... I think this was one of my big problems in\nunderstanding this. This video would have been impossible without\nCGP Grey. When I told him in London about this idea in London...\nAnd I felt like 'pssshhh mind just blown with this whole thing'\nHe said it was going to be really hard to explain and when he says it's hard to explain\nyou know things are going to be tough.

I made a video promising to make a video about\nthe answer to this.

Drive it at the right frequency.\nOh Yes!!\nSuccess is frightening.","Hx9TwM4Pmhc":"This is a water jet pack... but no, that's\nnot me flying it. This is me. It's harder than it looks, ok? But to understand how it works, we need to\nfirst talk rocket science. Rocket science is meant to be one of the most\ncomplicated things in the world, but the basic principle is incredibly simple. It's just Newton's 3rd law -- all forces come\nin pairs, which are equal and opposite. To demonstrate this, I'm using a fire extinguisher\non a skateboard. As the carbon dioxide is forced out the back\nof the extinguisher, it puts a force forwards on me causing me to accelerate. Or that's the theory anyway. If you look closely, you can spot the exact\nmoment I realize this is a fail. So what was the problem here? Well the force applied to me by the carbon\ndioxide is equal to the rate of mass ejected out the back of the fire extinguisher, call\nit m-dot for short, multiplied by the velocity of that exhaust gas. So in this case the carbon dioxide wasn't\nejected fast enough to create a big enough force and overcome the small frictional forces\nto get me to accelerate. But it can be done as has been demonstrated\nmany times on Youtube. When the space shuttle lifts off, exhaust\ngasses exit the nozzle at 3 to 4 km\/s, ejecting an amount of mass of 9000 kg\/s. This creates thrust equal to 30,000,000 N\nor the equivalent of about 2 million decent fire extinguishers. Now imagine you are an astronaut preparing\nfor launch in the space shuttle. You'd be seated not vertically but horizontally,\nperpendicular to the acceleration. That's because the human body is a bit like\na water balloon where the water represents your blood and the balloon represents your\nharder parts like your skeleton. Now, if you are accelerated up really quickly,\nthen your skeleton accelerates up at that rate but your blood tends to stay where it\nis. And this results in the blood ending up in\nyour feet. Now since there's not enough oxygen going\nto your brain you would black out. But fighter pilots face an arguably worse\nfate when they accelerate down too fast, because then the blood all rushes to their head and\nthey suffer something called a red-out, where the blood actually comes out of their eyes,\nnose, mouth, and ears. But back to astronauts, since you are reclined,\nat worst the blood will end up in the back of your body and the back of your head, but\nyour brain will still have enough oxygen to remain conscious. Now as the spacecraft lifts off and starts\nspeeding up, the acceleration is initially a very reasonable five to eight meters per\nsecond squared - that's less acceleration than an object in free fall here at the surface\nof Earth. But as the spacecraft continues to burn fuel,\nits mass decreases, while the thrust remains essentially constant. Now Newton's second law says that the acceleration\nof an object equals the net force applied to it divided by its mass. So as the mass decreases, the acceleration\nincreases -- and it increases at an increasing rate. So much so that at the end of the rocket burn\nthe thrust has to actually be limited in order to keep the acceleration from going over three\ng's -- that's three times the acceleration due to gravity or about 30 meters per second\nsquared. Now the term g-force has been invented to\ngive a sense of the amount of force experienced by astronauts, in multiples of the force we\nexperience everyday. Right now you are experiencing one g-force,\nprobably on your butt if you're sitting down -- can you feel that force? But accelerating at three g's you would experience\nthree g-forces. So the force between your back and the chair\nwould be the same as if you had two of you stacked on top of you. Hey, pipe down below, huh? You guys are heavy. Oh, man. You know that feeling when you're taking off\nin a plane and it feels like you're pressed into the seat, well really it's the seat pressing\ninto you. But if you imagine that feeling times 20,\nthat's what it would be like to be taking off in the space shuttle. Now an interesting side note is that we think\nof the space shuttle's acceleration as being mainly vertical because that's what we see\nwhen it lifts off. But that's actually not true. Once the space shuttle exits the thicker part\nof the atmosphere, it turns horizontal and accelerates up to its orbital velocity 28,000\nkm\/h. So most of the acceleration of a spacecraft,\nin orbit anyway, is horizontal. So how is this like a jet pack? Well unlike the shuttle, you don't carry your\nown propellant with you. And also, there's no chemical reaction releasing\nenergy that drives the propellant downwards. Instead the jetski pumps water out of the\nlake and up that hose at a rate up to 60 litres per second. And then right on these nozzles here, the\nwater changes directions. So it goes from coming up to being fired out\nthe bottom, and that change in momentum as it goes over the bend is what actually pushed\nthe jetpack up. Because the jetpack's pushing down on the\nwater, so by Newton's third law, the water has to push up on the jetpack\ngenerating 1800 Newtons of thrust, that's roughly equivalent to 150 decent fire extinguishers. This could accelerate me at up to 1.5 g's And you use your hands in order to steer. Lifting up to drive yourself upwards, moving\nyour hands down to accelerate forwards, and pretend like you're turning a big wheel very\ngently in order to turn side to side. One thing you don't want to do is try to explain\nthe physics of the jetpack while in the air. That's what I was trying to do here... While you're learning your thrust is controlled\nby your instructor so if he sees you doing something stupid he'll just turn off the thrust\nand drop you into the lake so you don't hurt yourself. That's generally a good idea unless you're\non a collision course with the jetski. I got a pretty fat lip from doing this but\nthankfully all my teeth were intact. When the thrust is equal to my weight plus\nthe weight of the water in the hose, then I can hover or move with constant velocity. It's a common misconception that you need\na little bit of unbalanced force to move with a constant velocity -- in truth if the forces\nare balanced, you will continue moving with whatever constant velocity you have. The other common misconception about rockets\nis that you need something to push off like the atmosphere. In reality, what you are pushing off is the\npropellant, so even without the air around a water jetpack would still work because you're\npushing off the water that is coming out those nozzles. If you want to go jetpacking I recommend you\ngo easy on the controls. I mean the worst thing you can do is overcompensate,\nwhich I think is a typical human reaction, because you're reacting to where you are and\nhow fast you're moving and you're not reacting to acceleration which is the real thing that\nyou can control. So even if you're coming down towards the\nwater quite quickly you may be slowing down so it may be ok and you don't need to adjust\nanything. You just need to trust that the jetpack will\nget you out of any trouble. It's a pretty incredibly experience, feeling\nthe power of that water rushing passed you. It's the closest I've gotten to flying really. That's the power of physics.

Light is brightness, I guess. - We have auras?\n- We all have auras. - Which are light?\n- Yes, they are. It lights up the room, it makes it... not dark. - What's the difference between blue light and red light?\n- The color. It goes in your eyes and then you see stuff. The range from white to red to orange to green, it's like the chakras of your body. - Can you see my aura?\n- No, not particularly right now. - Is it too bright out?\n- It's very sunny out here today. - Does that make it harder to see someone's aura?\n- Not necessarily. If I was to explain it to a blind person, I'd... It would be... It would be the difference... You see nothing whatsoever as a blind person, whereas I see things in front of me. To be fair, the question of what light is, is not an easy one. For centuries, the greatest minds in science debated this issue. In the late 1600s, Newton proposed that light was a stream of particles or corpuscles. He proposed this in his treatise, Opticks. But at the same time, a dutch physicist named Huygens proposed that light was a wave. And this debate raged on until it was settled by the experiment I've recreated today, Thomas Young's double slit experiment. To make sure I got the experiment right, I went to the original source. With a help of Brady Haran, I managed to get into the vault, underneath the Royal Society in London. We're in! There, I found Thomas Young's handwritten notes from 1803. I brought into the sunbeam a slip of card, about one-thirtieth of an inch in breadth, and observed its shadow, either on the wall or on other cards held at different distances. Besides the fringes of color on each side of the shadow, the shadow itself was divided by similar parallel fringes, of smaller dimensions. Wow. This is an experiment so simple that you could make it at home, and yet so fiddly that I've never seen it before done with sunlight. - I was thinking about doing it in a box, like a fridge box.\n- And you could take it out on the street. Taking it out on the street. Could I possibly interview you guys for about a minute? We're doing a science experiment. What I have here is an empty box, and this is a little eye piece where we can look in, and this is a hole. And I'm gonna place this slide above that hole, and if you look closely, you'll see that there is two openings, very narrow openings side-by-side. It's a double slit. Now, before we have a look, we need to tilt it towards the sun a little bit, so...\nwe want the sun to hit this double slit directly. - What are we gonna see on the bottom of the box?\n-The obvious thing you think you're gonna see is you're gonna see two lines. Two lines on the bottom of the box. Two broad-bands. - Two little lines.\n- Yeah. I think it will be one... one line, sort of two. I can expect to see the whole box lit up. - Probably a kaleidoscope, of some sort.\n- A bunch of colors. Probably, yeah. Rainbow? Different colors? There, have a look. You expected to see kind of one line - is that what you see? No! I see dots. How many? It's one circle. Oh, there's one.. there's one in the middle, the strongest, two either side. The two on the outside are multicolored, and the one in the middle... is just white. It looks kind of a rainbow. The rainbow of color as well. Quite a few colors and lots of little dots. And there are more dots appearing. I think I can even see more dots spreading along. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, I can see tons of dots now. Not tons, but I can see dots spreading across that way. - On either side?\n- Yeah, definitely. - Isn't that amazing?\n- Yeah, that's incredible. - And that's just nothing else apart from... \n- Two slits. That's incredible. But all we're doing is we're putting light through two very narrow slits side-by-side, so how does this make any sense? There's some kind of principle involved in it that the average person's not familiar with. That's the only explanation. I'm really confused by it, but I'd like to find out why. People were debating: Is light a wave or is it made of particles? So what causes that? Well, if light were behaving as particles, you would expecting to go through each slit and just produce a bright spot underneath, so we would see two bright spots under the bottom of the box. But, if light is behaving as waves, then the wave from one slit can interact with the waves from the other slit. I've got a demonstration here on a little pond, where we can see this with water waves. I have two sources of ripples, which are basically like the two slits, when I create ripples with a single source, they travel out with circular wave front, nothing particularly surprising there. But, if I add a second source of ripples, then we start getting an interesting pattern. This pattern is created by the ripples from the two sources interacting with each other. Where they meet up peaks with peeks and troughs with troughs, the amplitude of the wave is increased, that's what we call constructive interference. But if the peak from one wave meets up with the trough from the other, then we get destructive interference and there's basically no wave there. And this is exactly what was happening with the light. When the light from one slit met up peaks with peaks and troughs with troughs, they constructively interfered and produced a bright spot. But, if the trough from the wave from one slit met up with the peak of the wave from the other slit, they would destructively interfere, and you wouldn't see any light there. It's light canceling itself out. - This is basically the same is like having two drops of waterfall in a swimming pool,\n- That's right, - exactly the same pattern.\n- and then they're going overlap As this ripple overlaps with those ripples, down the bottom, you get a series of... you get like a bright spot... and then a dark spot, then a bright spot, then a dark spot, then a bright spot. Now there is a slight complication, which is that sunlight is composed of many different colors, and they have different wave lengths. So, obviously, they're gonna meet up at slightly different points, and that's what caused the rainbowing effects as we go further from the central maximum. You saw the ones to the right were slightly colored, that's because the reds are gonna meet up at different places than the blues. And that's all that makes color differences, is different wavelengths? - Exactly.\n- That's amazing. So the difference between\u2014 So that red bin over there on the green pot it's just... I'm seeing that - It's a different wavelength.\n- It's just different wavelength. - And that's how we're bringing these beautiful colors all around us.\n- Exactly. That's amazing, I'm amazed! Thanks, man! Thank you! I have been enlightened, literally. Now, you may have noticed in that experiment that the light on the bottom of the box was not in the shape of slits, rather they were more kinda round blobs, and I want to know why that is. Can you write an answer for me in the comment section? And I'll give you a hint: one of the videos I've linked kind of is suggestive of the answer. So convincing were the results of Young's double slit experiment that the scientific community concluded that light must be a wave, there is no way it could be a particle.","cY_o4A1wzsg":"Hey Youtube, you said you wanted to talk.

Nah, I'm good, thanks. It's just downstairs. Nah, the tennis is on. You come to my house to watch the tennis and you're not even going to get me another coke? Yeah, it's the tiebreaker.  Relax. You know what I wish we had? Like a really long straw so we don't even have to go downstairs to the kitchen. That would be pretty good. Yeah. Yeah.  Right? How long of a straw could we actually make that you could use? Downstairs is a bit of a stretch I reckon.  Yeah.  How much is that, like, 3, 4 meters? Do you think we could? I reckon we could do it. We'd need a lot of straws though. We got a pack here. Oh, okay. Now our first test, just to see that Nigel can use a straw properly, we've got about a 1 meter length of straw here. Think you can suck through that? I could give it a go.  So we just taped these drinking straws together, and hopefully Yeah, that's alright.  But there's a lot of air coming through I think from the The joints in the straw, yeah.  We've gotta come up with some better way to test this out. I happen to have 6 meters of plastic tubing here. Non-toxic? Uhh, that's what they said at the hardware store. We're preparing the preliminary tests.  Nigel is lowering some tubing off the balcony. He actually thinks he's got a shot at sucking through 6 meters of tubing I think he's got no chance and he's going to be nowhere close, but I think this will allow us to establish how much Nigel actually sucks. (laughing) He's getting ready up there.  He knows there's a lot riding on it. When you're ready! Look at that! Look at that!  Woah, he shoots up! He's got 2 meters! He's got three meters! Look at that guy go! He's getting 4 meters, 4 meters! 5! 5 meters! 6! Yeah!  (Cheering) Now I'm going to try to do the same thing, but the tube I'm using has a thicker diameter. Mine is about 5 mil, where as Nigel's was 3mil. So we're going to see if this makes any difference. (Inspiring music) Now, I guess the obvious question is, can Nigel do it? Yes Nigel thinks that's the obvious answer but I'm pretty sure he's going to fail. Now, maybe what's worth talking about is how a straw works in the first place. How does it work? Yeah, cause this is really just a big bendy straw.  If we look at a smaller version of a straw here We should all be familiar with how this works.  Or should we? I don't know.  I think most people think you're just sucking the liquid in and swallowing it. But, you knid of have to think about air pressure. Yeah, because actually what's happening is that air pressure is causing the, coke in this case, to go up the straw. Well there's a difference in pressure in the atmospheric pressure and the pressure that you create by opening up your lungs and pulling your diaphragm down. So you reduce the pressure in your mouth, and it's that difference in pressure between the atmospheric pressure and the pressure inside you which gets that liquid flowing into you. someone has failed at the 5 mm diameter and you're the next guy to take it on. You ready for this? I am ready. He's been practicing his whole life for this. Yeah, you can see it's a strong start. Strong start from Quan You've got it.  Oh, he's going big right here. You can see there's a lot of determination. He's getting close, getting close.  Look at this. Look at this.  Can he do it? Can he do it? Ohhhhhh, and he's done it! (cheering) Agh.  That tastes disgusting. Yeah I definitely felt like my tounge, while I was trying to suck it up was being pulled out into the straw (off) I felt the same thing But. And it was tougher, definitely tougher. Well done sir. Thank you.  Means a lot. For his next challenge, we're going to try to get him to suck through 10.3 meters which is the theoretical maximum, size of straw How are you feeling? Well, that theoretical maximum, kind of relies on being able to get a perfect vacuum and, although I am perfect in a lot of ways, I don't know that I can create a perfect vacuum. I have often thought that there is actually a perfect vacuum inside Nigel's head Today we're going to really find out, won't we? Ok, we've got the setup here.  We're down at Tamarama Beach And we have 10.5 meters worth of tubing Which goes all the way up to Nigel at the very top there. So I'm going to see if I can relive some of my former glory and get the red liquid up this height. 3!  2!  1! There you have it.  Nigel is starting to suck on that straw. There he goes. Looking strong.  Create that vacuum. Approaching the edge of the cliff there.  Go, Nigel, Go! C'mon, Nigel! Doesn't seem to be going anywhere.  We seem a bit stuck. At that point right there.  You can see the determination, the focus. Trying to see how high that is He's done well But it just doesn't look like it's going to happen. (Music stops, and breaks down. Signalling failure) Alright, so Nigel did pretty well there We saw that he could get that liquid up the tube about 7 meters. Not the theoretical maximum of ten meters. Still more than you.  Just saying. That's a good point. That's a good point. If Nigel could have created a perfect vacuum, then the water would have gone up to 10.3 meters, according to our calculations. This is kind of similar to how they used to measure atmospheric pressure in the old days. by millimeters of mercury. So atmospheric pressure would push mercury up a tube with  a vacuum at the other end 760 millimeters. 760 millimeters. So about .76 of a meter. So you can see why they used mercury and not water because if you were doing this with water, you'd need a cliff yeah, you'd need a ten meter long barometer. so much better to do it with millimeters of mercury. and of course now we measure it in kilopascals. So anyway, well done Nigel.  You really suck. So how do we work out the maximum length of straw that you could suck through vertically? Well think about this.  You place the straw into the liquid. and you start sucking from the top. that decreases the pressure at the top and the difference in pressure between your mouth and atmospheric pressure creates a force that pushes the liquid upwards. Now that liquid which is in the straw has a weight which is equal to the volume of the liquid, times its density, times the gravitational field strength. so if we set these two forces equal to each other you can see that the pressure difference must be equal to the density of fluid times its height, times the gravitational field strength and if we sub in the numbers, we can see that the maximum height of liquid that anyone could lift, even if they created a perfect vacuum inside their mouth would be about 10.3 meters.","aFO4PBolwFg":"Shh... I've snuck into minutephysics' studio to explain\nhow a wing actually works Hang on, something doesn't feel right. Ah, that's better. Now everyone knows that a wing generates lift\ndue to its characteristic shape Since air travels farther over top of the\nwing, it must go faster than the air underneath so that both streams meet up simultaneously\nat the trailing edge And according to Bernoulli's principle, faster\nflowing air exerts less pressure than the slower air beneath the wing\nThis pressure difference creates an upward force -- lift. Job done. Right? Nope\nThis simple explanation taught in many textbooks and classrooms has obvious problems\nLike how could a plane fly upside down? Some planes like the Wright brothers' had\nnearly flat wings. So presumably air would travel the same speed\nover both sides and there would be no lift Plus experiments show that air streams don't\nmeet up at the back of the wing. Air over the top goes significantly faster,\nreaching the trailing edge first. So how does a wing actually generate lift? Well the key is the wing must deflect air\ndownwards This can be achieved using asymmetric or cambered\nair foils Or by increasing the angle of attack\nAir under the wing is deflected down And by the coanda effect\nair above the wing is guided along its surface and down as well\nSince the air is slowed and deflected down by the wing,\nit pushes the wing up and back. Lift, and drag. This is in accordance with Newton's Third\nLaw of Motion But hang on, if you can explain lift only\nusing the deflection of air and Newton's laws, then the Bernoulli explanation must be completely\nwrong Well, no,\nair over the top of the wing does go faster than air beneath, creating a pressure difference\nthat generates lift Then this Newtonian explanation is unnecessary\nrubbish and the original explanation was right! That's not true either. The original explanation incorrectly assumed\nthat air over and under the wing must reconnect at the trailing edge, and there was no mention\nof deflecting air down. Each explanation, done correctly, completely\naccounts for the lift generated by a wing. They're just two different ways of looking\nat the same thing. So next time someone brings up the standard\nmisconception, you can tell them that explanation just doesn't fly. And if you liked that, you've gotta check\nout MinutePhysics.

I know, it sounds hopeless. But luckily, you know something about nanotechnology. You know, really really tiny devices and materials\nthat are less than 100 nanometers in size. Of course I don't have to tell you a nanometer\nis a billionth of a meter. That's roughly the size of ten atoms. But how do you create something that tiny? It's time to embrace your inner MacGyver. You're gonna need a pencil, some scotch tape\nand a healthy dose of elbow grease. A pencil contains not lead but graphite, which\nconsists of sheets of carbon in a hexagonal lattice. When you write, layers of graphite slide off\nthe tip of the pencil and stick to the paper. Usually, many layers are stacked on top of\neach other but once in a while you get a single layer of carbon atoms. And this is called \"graphene\" In 2004, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov\ncreated graphene using nothing but graphite and scotch tape. They placed a graphite flake onto the tape,\nfolded it in two and then cleaved the flake in half. They repeated this procedure a number of times\nand then studied the resulting fragments. To their astonishment they found some of the\npieces were only a single atom thick. This was particularly unexpected because it\nwas thought a single layer of graphite would not be chemically stable, especially at room\ntemperature. Graphene conducts electrons faster than any\nother substance at room temperature. This is because of the extraordinarily high\nquality of the graphene lattice. Scientists are yet to find a single atom out\nof place in graphene. Since the electrons aren't scattered by defects\nin the lattice, they go so fast that Einstein's relativity must be used to understand their\nmotion. And this perfect lattice is created by the\nvery strong yet flexible bonds between carbon atoms -- making the substance bendable but\nharder than diamond. Graphene in incredibly strong -- if you could\nbalance an elephant on a pencil and support the pencil on graphene, the graphene wouldn't\nbreak. Of course the pencil would. For their discovery, Geim and Novoselov were\nawarded the Nobel Prize for physics in 2010. And this is only the beginning for Graphene. Scientists are hard at work exploiting its\nunique properties to create thin, transparent, flexible touch screens,\nSmaller, faster, more energy efficient computers Tough composite materials\nAnd more efficient solar cells And now consider this is only one aspect of\nnanotechnology, so in order to think big you need first consider the very small.","KzOkuGQC3Rw":"Want to spoil your girlfriend with diamonds\nwhile impressing her with your scientific knowledge.

Copper is not. But if you pass an electric current through\nany metal it becomes a magnet - an electromagnet. But how does this work? Well strangely enough, it's a consequence\nof special relativity. Special relativity is the fact that in our\nuniverse, length and time aren't absolute; they're perceived differently by observers\nmoving relative to each other (hence, \"relativity\"). For example, if you measure carefully enough,\nyou'll find that time passes slower for observers moving relative to you. Hey Derek, when did you last shave? Derek1: Six hours ago. MovingDerek: Actually it was five hours, 59\nminutes and 59.99999999999 seconds And moving objects are also contracted in\ntheir direction of motion. You're looking slim. Only in your frame of reference. So when an object is moving relative to you,\nit actually takes up less space than when it's not moving. And even though this effect is obviously way\ntinier than we've shown, length contraction IS what makes an electromagnet work. Picture a copper wire - it consists of positive\nmetal ions swimming in a sea of free negative electrons. Now the number of protons is equal to the\nnumber of negative electrons so overall the wire is neutral. So if there were a positive charged, err...\npositively charged cat nearby, it would experience no force from the wire on it at all. And even if there were a current in the wire,\nthe electrons would just be drifting in one direction, but the density of positive and\nnegative charges would still be the same, and so the wire would be neutral, so no force\non the kitty. But what if the cat starts moving? Imagine for simplicity that that the cat is\nmoving in the same direction as the electrons with the same velocity. Well now in my frame of reference, the wire\nis still neutral and so there should be no force on the cat, but consider the same situation\nin her frame of reference. In the cat's frame of reference the positive\ncharges in the wire are moving, so according to special relativity their separation will\nbe ever-so-slightly contracted. Also, from this perspective the electrons\naren't moving so they'll be more spread out than before - remember, objects take up more\nspace when they're not moving than when they are. These two changes together mean there's a\nhigher density of positive charges in the wire, so it's no longer neutral - it's positively\ncharged! Which means that the positively charged cat\nwill feel a repulsive electric force from the wire. But in my frame of reference this seems mysterious:\nthere's no force on a stationary charged cat, but a moving cat is somehow repelled from\nthis neutral wire. How do you account for this force? Well we say it is the magnetic force, and\nthat's mainly because a wire with current in it deflects nearby magnets. So really, what this experiment shows is that\na magnetic field is just an electric field viewed from a different frame of reference. In the cat's frame of reference, it is repelled\nfrom the wire due to the electric field created by the excess positive charges produced by\nthe effects of length contraction. In MY frame of reference, the cat is repelled\nfrom a neutral wire due to the magnetic field generated by current flowing in the wire. So whether you see it as an electric or a\nmagnetic field just depends on your frame of reference, but in either case the results\nare the same. So an electromagnet is an everyday example\nof special relativity in action. Now that might seem crazy since electrons\ndrift through wires at about .0000000001% the speed of light - so how can special relativity\nhave anything to do with it? Well the truth is there are enough electrons\nin a wire, and the electric interaction is so amazingly strong that even the minuscule\neffects of length contraction can produce significant charge imbalances that produce\na noticeable force. So special relativity explains electromagnets\n- but what about permanent magnets? Yeah! I mean there can't be electrical currents\nflowing around inside lumps of rock, can there?

Now they're called pups, but when they're\nborn they're between 1.2 and 1.5 meters! So that's a pretty big baby. It takes a great white shark about ten to\ntwelve years to reach maturity at which point the females are actually about a meter longer\nthan the males - the largest recorded being over six meters - roughly the size of this\nred boat behind me. At this length they'd weigh about two to three\nthousand kilograms. Oh man! Now there are stories of some great whites\nbeing over seven meters but those are unsubstantiated. White sharks are warm bodied. They're not warm-blooded like us - they can't\nmaintain a perfectly stable temperature, but their internal organs are kept at up to thirteen\ndegrees above the average temperature of the ambient water around them. The heat generated by their muscles is actually\ntransferred to the blood in their veins as it returns from the shark's extremities, so\nit warms it up and keeps the core temperature a little bit hotter. This allows the shark to venture into colder\nwaters and also to have explosive power. Its muscles work a lot better when warm than\nwhen cold, just like ours. The tradeoff is the shark requires about ten\ntimes as much energy as if it didn't heat its body and that's why they need to feed\non these blubber-rich seals and whale carcasses. White sharks like to hunt when it's light\nout because they use their eyesight to spot their prey. But when they open their jaws, their eyes\nactually roll back into their head to protect them and so they're actually blind when they're\ntaking a bite. Now they do like conditions that are a little\nlow visibility because they rely on stealth to track down their prey. If a seal spots them coming, it's basically\ngame over because the seal is so much more maneuverable and it can definitely get away\nfrom the shark. But they only eat sea mammals after they're\nabout 2.5 meters long, which is why most of the sharks we're seeing around here are quite\nlarge. Before that, they're diet consists mainly\nof fish. The gestation period is thought to be about\neighteen months and that leads to a two to three year reproduction cycle and with such\nsmall litters that means it takes a long time for this shark population to recover. There are a couple misconceptions about great\nwhite sharks. One is that they can't get cancer and that's\nled to a lot of people hunting them down and trying to use their fins as an anti-cancer\nsoup. But in reality sharks get cancer just like\nanything else and there is photographic evidence of sharks with big tumors so it makes no sense\nto hunt down sharks as a cancer remedy because they get cancer just like we do. Another misconception is sharks are coastal\ncreatures that just cruise the beaches waiting to bite people. In reality the sharks spend much of their\ntime way, way out at sea and very deep, over a kilometer deep. It's kind of shocking but we've only found\nthis out in the last couple of years so there is so much about sharks that remains undiscovered. We don't know where they go or what they do\nfor most of the time that they're alive. That's why research projects like this are\nso important to find out more about the shark and figure out how we can help it rehabilitate\nand become the predator of the sea that it once was.","sMb00lz-IfE":"- What will happen tomorrow is not random. In other words, it's at least somewhat predictable. I mean, not entirely to be sure, but some\nthings will happen for certain, and other things definitely won't. For example, the sun will rise, water will\nstill freeze at zero degrees celsius, - and you won't become Michael Stevens. - We know this because everything in the universe\nis made of 12 fundamental particles, and they interact in four predictable ways. - What if I were able to determine the positions\nand velocities of every single one of these particles in the universe? - Well, you would be the intelligence envisioned\nby Laplace, who thought if you could really figure out where everything is and how fast\nit's moving, you would know the entire future of the universe, because you know how every\nparticle interacts with every other particle. - Wow, so nothing would be unpredictable,\nwhich means, nothing would be random. - Not even human behavior. Since we are made of the same fundamental\nparticles as everything in the rest of the universe, everything we will ever do, or have\never done, would be determined by the information in the state of the universe at any one time. - But what is information? Well, it seems to be fundamentally about order. The order of molecules in your DNA contain\nthe information needed to make you. It is the order of zeros and ones streaming\nthrough the internet that contain all the information required to play this video. It is the order of letters that makes a word,\nand the order of words that makes a sentence that carries information. So fundamentally, information seems to be\nabout order. Regularity. That is, until you really think about it. I mean, does every letter of a word carry\nthe same amount of information? No. I mean, after a \"Q\", you know almost for certain\nthat the next letter will be a \"U\". After a \"Th\", there will probably be an \"E\". So these letters carry very little information,\nbecause you could predict them beforehand. They are redundant. In fact, the founder of information theory,\nClaude Shannon, estimated the redundancy of English at about 75%, which is why we can\nmake sense of things like this. So English can be compressed, because it is\nnot random. It has patterns. Similarly, this video is compressible because\nof its regularities. In each frame, the pixels of similar color\ncluster together. Plus, from frame to frame, most of the pixels\ndon't change. So you only need to record the ones that do\nchange. - You can take advantage of this technique\nto create some trippy effects known as datamoshing. It's the application of the movement data\nfrom one video, to the pixels of another. - It also means that an average video can\nbe compressed to just one thousandth of its original size. - But what is the most you can compress something? - Well, anything that is not random, any patters\nor regularities, can be reduced, because they are predictable. So you can continue shrinking a file down\nuntil what you're left with is totally random. - And that will contain all of the information\nof the original item but distilled. Pure information. - So pure information is randomness. If you want to know how much information something\ncontains, you need to know how random it is. And randomness is disorder... What we also call ... - [Both] Entropy. - So information, fundamentally, is entropy. This makes sense if you consider a string\nof binary digits. For example, this string is perfectly ordered. It has very low entropy, and it contains no\ninformation. That's the state of an erased hard drive. Now, this string contains slightly more information,\nbut again, the regularities allow it to be easily compressed. So the string that contains the maximum amount\nof information is just-- a random set of zeros and ones. It has maximum entropy because it's totally\ndisordered. You could not predict any of those digits\nby looking at any of the other digits. And if you wanted to send this information\nto someone, you would have no other option but to send the whole string of digits. There's no way to compress it. But here's the thing about any object that\ncontains maximum information. For us as human beings, they carry no meaning. For example, a video containing maximum information\nwould look like this. It is just white noise. The color of each pixel is independent of\nall the other pixels, and they all change randomly. This video could not be compressed, because\nit's already totally random. Now a random sequence of DNA would not make\nan organism. And a random string of letters does not generally\nmake a word. We are drawn to things that are neither perfectly\nordered, containing no information, nor are they perfectly disordered, containing maximum\ninformation. Somewhere in the middle, we can recognize\ncomplex patterns, and that is where we derive meaning. In music, poetry, and ideas. It is this search for meaning that leads us\nto propose scientific theories, which if you think about it, are really our way of compressing\nthe universe. For example, general relativity, our current\ntheory of gravity, compresses into one short equation. Everything from how an apple falls to the\nearth, to how the moon orbits the earth, how all the planets orbit the sun, how the sun\norbits a supermassive blackhole at the center of our galaxy, how blackholes form and behave,\nand how the whole universe expands out from the Big Bang. Now that we have this theory, the future is\nmore predictable. I mean, we can predict eclipses thousands\nof years into the future. So, with all of our scientific theories, does\nthat mean that the universe is completely not random? That it is perfectly predictable? Well, let's assume for a second that Laplace\nwas right, and that knowing the state of the universe at any one time, means you also know\nits state at every other time as well. Well, that would mean that the information\nin our universe would be constant. But if information is entropy, that would\nmean the entropy of the universe is also constant. And that does not appear to be the universe\nthat we live in. The second law of thermodynamics states that\nentropy in the universe increases with time. Or in other words, things don't stir themselves\napart. But if entropy is going up, that means the\ninformation in our universe is constantly increasing. That makes sense, because it would take more\ninformation to specify the state of the universe now, than right after the Big Bang. So, where is this new information coming from? My best bet is quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics describes how the 12 fundamental\nparticles behave. And as spectacularly successful as it is,\nit is only a probabilistic theory. Meaning that you cannot predict with absolute\ncertainty where an electron, say, will be at some later time. You can only calculate probabilities of where\nyou are likely to find it. So when you do interact with it, and locate\nthe electron at a particular point, you have gained information. You now know something that you couldn't have\npredicted with certainty beforehand. This drove Einstein crazy. He said, \"God does not play dice,\" referring\nto this. I mean, he wished that we could compress our\ntheory of quantum mechanics further, so that we could really figure out where these particles\nwere going to be. But maybe the reason why we haven't been able\nto compress quantum mechanics further, is because fundamentally, it's random. Fundamentally, new information is being generated\nevery time a quantum event like that occurs. In that case, it could be these quantum measurements\nwhich are driving up the entropy of the universe. They are creating new information all of the\ntime, and that means the disorder in our universe must go up. This is what we observe as the second law\nof thermodynamics. You know, we often think about the second\nlaw as a curse. As though everything which is ordered is going\ntowards disorder. But maybe, I mean, it's only in a universe\nwhere this law is obeyed, that the truly unexpected can occur. That the future can be actually undetermined. For us really to have free will, we need the\nsecond law of thermodynamics. Now, you might think that these quantum events\nare too small to have any meaningful impact on the evolution of the universe, but that\nis not true. And that's because, there are physical systems\nwhich are so dependent, so sensitive to the initial conditions that any tiny change will\nend up making a big difference later down the track. That's called \"chaos.\" But it's also known as \"the butterfly effect.\" So you and I could be such physical systems. Chaotic systems. And our free will could come from quantum\nevents in our brains. So it looks as though we live in a universe\nwhere the future is yet to be determined. That is to say, it is at least somewhat random. - But Derek, what is the most random thing\npossible in the universe? - That's a good question, Michael. - You know, it's such a good question, I'm\ntalking about it over on Vsauce. Do you wanna go find out about randomness\nwith me? - Let's go check it out. - Alright. - And you can decide whether to click over\nor not. - Oh, that's nice. - Yeah! - Yeah.","SQggDnScsvI":"There is a misconception about chameleons\nthat they change their color in order to blend in with their environment. That is actually not the case. When a chameleon is calm it is green and so\nit naturally blends in with its leafy surroundings. But male chameleons change color when they\nbecome excited in the presence of a female or a rival male, as shown here. I will put the first frame in the bottom right\nfor comparison. As you can see, as he becomes more excited,\nhis color changes to be more yellow orange and red. So instead of blending in this chameleon will\nnow stand out. But how do chameleons actually change their\ncolor? For years we thought that there was a simple\nwell-established mechanism for this color change. In their skin, chameleons have different cells\ncontaining colored pigments. Some are yellow others are red and some contain\nthe dark melanin pigment. Many animals including chameleons are known\nto turn a darker shade by causing the melanin to spread out along the fingery extensions\nof the cell. They turn lighter again by condensing the\npigment back into one spot. It was assumed that chameleons must turn yellow,\norange and red in the same way, by causing those pigments to spread out in those cells. But new research from collaborating groups\nof physicist and biologists at the University of Geneva shows that this is incorrect. Now the first clue should come from the fact\nthat there is actually no green pigment in the a chameleon. The green color actually created by two distinct\nmechanisms, pigment color and structural color. Beneath the yellow pigment cells, there are\ncells containing tiny 130 nm crystals regularly arranged in a lattice. Now light diffracts off these crystals and\ndue to the spacing between them, blue light constructively interferes and is therefore\nstrongly reflected. Whereas the other colors are not reflected. This is very similar to how a morpho butterfly\nwing creates an iridescent blue. There is no blue pigment just the periodic\nnanoscale structure that acts as a strong reflector for only one color. So a chameleon looks green due to the combination\nof the yellow light from the pigment plus the blue light reflected off the crystal structure\nbeneath it. So how do chameleons change this green into\nyellow orange and red? Well previously it was assumed that the color\nchange was achieved by dispersing pigments in the colored cells. But now scientists have found it's actually\nthe crystals underneath which are changing. By increasing the spacing between the crystals\nthe chameleons can change which color is selectively reflected. Bigger gaps between the crystals are better\nat reflecting longer wavelengths. So as the spacing increases, the color changes\nfrom blue to green to yellow, and then orange and red. Scientists compared skin samples from calm\ngreen chameleons and excited yellow chameleons and found that indeed, in the excited chameleon\nthe crystal spacing was much further apart. Here you can see a single cell enlarged and\nthe color it reflects changing from blue to green to yellow, orange and red. Plus, a computer simulation of the light reflected\noff crystals while their spacing is decreasing also provides excellent agreement with these\nobservations. Furthermore, applying physical pressure to\nthe skin causes the crystals to compress and so they reflect more blue. When that pressure is removed, the crystals\nexpand again reflecting more green light. The structure of a chameleon\u2019s skin gets\neven more fascinating, as there is another layer of cells underneath which also contain\ncrystals. But these crystals are larger more spaced\nout and more disorganized. This means they reflect longer wavelengths\nin the infrared part of the spectrum and they reflect a broader range of these wavelengths. It\u2019s thought that the function of this layer\ncould be to reflect light from the sun since these chameleons live in bright full-sun habitats. So male chameleons don't change their color\nby spreading out red and yellow pigments. Instead they do something much more remarkable. They actively tune the spacing between nanoscale\ncrystals in order to create structural colors that span the whole length of the visible\nspectrum. Now what I find amazing is that in this day\nand age we thought we had the answer to how chameleons change color, but it actually took\nthe combined expertise of physicists and biologists working together to figure out what's really\ngoing on. This episode of Veritasium was supported by\nLinda.com a leading online learning platform with over 3000 video courses taught by experts\nin areas ranging from video production to web development and computer programming.
