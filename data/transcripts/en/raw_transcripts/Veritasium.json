the","start":549.24,"duration":5.82},{"text":"answer is no for a number of reasons in","start":552.21,"duration":4.77},{"text":"an open reservoir there is more

it's","start":579.96,"duration":3.48},{"text":"almost like a double pane window you get","start":581.85,"duration":3.39},{"text":"that air gap in there and the air acts","start":583.44,"duration":3.66},{"text":"as an insulator and so the Sun never","start":585.24,"duration":3.33},{"text":"hits the water matter fact

go","start":615.36,"duration":4.08},{"text":"to remove them they're their recyclable","start":617.64,"duration":4.92},{"text":"material so but but we've figured

more...","start":102.9,"duration":1.52},{"text":"This is a pretty good guess,","start":106.42,"duration":1.68},{"text":"and I think the behavior is not exactly the same as the mystery cylinder,","start":108.1,"duration":4.12},{"text":"but it definitely is similar,","start":112.46,"duration":1.92},{"text":"and that's no coincidence.","start":114.72,"duration":1.64},{"text":"The mystery cylinder actually contains","start":116.68,"duration":3.34},{"text":"honey...","start":120.02,"duration":1.96},{"text":"and ping pong balls.","start":121.98,"duration":1.4},{"text":"There are two ping pong balls submerged in this honey.","start":123.38,"duration":4.3},{"text":"So if I place that on the ramp,","start":127.68,"duration":3.48},{"text":"the center of gravity is not above the point of contact with the ramp, and so it rolls forward,","start":131.46,"duration":6.16},{"text":"but now, because those ping pong balls are in the front,","start":137.62,"duration":4.02},{"text":"they change the center of gravity, and so it's exactly over the point of contact,","start":141.64,"duration":4.98},{"text":"and so it stops briefly,","start":147.06,"duration":1.6},{"text":"but then, as the viscosity of the honey allows those\nping pong balls to move up,","start":148.66,"duration":5.18},{"text":"the center of gravity shifts forwards again,\nallowing this little container to roll.","start":153.84,"duration":4.34},{"text":"So that is the trick of the mystery cylinder.","start":158.6,"duration":2.96},{"text":"Pretty

this.","start":187.54,"duration":2.84},{"text":"It's impossible.","start":190.38,"duration":1.18},{"text":"I mean, you might think I could run 3V\u2081 for my 2nd lap, and that would mean my total average speed is 2V\u2081.","start":191.56,"duration":6.7},{"text":"The problem is you can't just add the two speeds together and divide by two,","start":198.26,"duration":4.06},{"text":"because you spent much more time in your first lap, so that speed is weighted more heavily into the average,","start":202.32,"duration":6.06},{"text":"so you'd have to run, well, impossibly fast.","start":208.98,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Let me explain.","start":212.48,"duration":0.9},{"text":"The velocity of the first lap was the distance around the track divided by t\u2081, the time it took you.","start":213.38,"duration":5.64},{"text":"Now, if you want your total average speed to be 2V\u2081,","start":219.42,"duration":4.1},{"text":"well then it needs to be 2d \u00f7 t\u2081.","start":223.68,"duration":3.16},{"text":"You need to run twice the distance in the same amount of time it took you to run the first lap,","start":226.84,"duration":5.04},{"text":"but you've already run that first lap, and so you have\nno time remaining to run the second lap!","start":231.88,"duration":4.52},{"text":"Even if you went the speed of

the question about the train,","start":261.08,"duration":2.96},{"text":"was actually answered pretty well, with most people mentioning something to do with the

people though did point out that maybe it was the steam that was going backwards,","start":273.94,"duration":5.12},{"text":"or maybe air molecules in the train, \nand that is actually a pretty clever point,","start":279.34,"duration":4.14},{"text":"however I wouldn't really consider the air in the train part of the train,","start":283.48,"duration":4.14},{"text":"so indeed, the part of the train that is moving backwards","start":287.7,"duration":3.86},{"text":"is the flange part of the wheel,\nwhich is below the rail.","start":291.56,"duration":5.3},{"text":"That is the part of the train which is moving backwards.","start":297.08,"duration":2.86},{"text":"To understand why,\nyou just think about a spinning wheel.","start":299.94,"duration":3.36},{"text":"The top of the wheel is moving forwards at speed 2V,","start":303.3,"duration":2.82},{"text":"and the bottom of the wheel is not moving forward at all; it is stationary with respect to the track,","start":306.12,"duration":5.86},{"text":"and that is what we call \"rolling without slipping,\"\nand that's how most wheels work.","start":311.98,"duration":4.56},{"text":"At least, that's how they're designed to work.","start":316.54,"duration":1.86},{"text":"Now, in the case of trains, they have to have flanges so the train doesn't fall off its rails,","start":318.98,"duration":6.08},{"text":"but of course, when these pieces come around during the rotation of the wheel,","start":325.06,"duration":3.84},{"text":"they actually extend beyond the rail, and therefore,\nthey are going backwards with respect to the ground,","start":328.9,"duration":6.54},{"text":"so the part of the train that's moving backwards is always changing,","start":335.44,"duration":3.18},{"text":"but it's always that part of the flange,","start":338.8,"duration":2.64},{"text":"that part that extends beyond the wheel that is below the level of the track.","start":341.44,"duration":4.58},{"text":"So what happens when you pull\nthe bottom pedal of a bike backwards?","start":346.46,"duration":4.68},{"text":"Well, about 45% of you thought that\nthe bike would move backwards,","start":351.14,"duration":3.88},{"text":"about a quarter said it would move forwards,\nand a quarter said the bike wouldn't move at all,","start":355.02,"duration":5.62},{"text":"and 5% said it depends on something...","start":361.2,"duration":3.3},{"text":"So let's give it a shot and see what happens.","start":365.2,"duration":1.68},{"text":"I'm going to pull backwards on the bike pedal\nin 3, 2, 1...","start":366.88,"duration":5.2},{"text":"Woah!","start":375.82,"duration":0.7},{"text":"The bike did indeed move back,","start":376.52,"duration":2.34},{"text":"and for virtually all bikes, this is what you will find,","start":379.16,"duration":3.68},{"text":"but the explanation is not just as simple as\n\"well, the net force on the bike is back,","start":382.84,"duration":4.02},{"text":"so therefore, it has to accelerate backwards,\"","start":386.86,"duration":2.48},{"text":"and to prove that that logic doesn't work,\nwell, just have a look at this video by George Hart.","start":389.34,"duration":5.94},{"text":"[George] Watch this. \nAgain, I pull the same pedal backward, but now...","start":395.28,"duration":3.88},{"text":"the bike moves forward!","start":399.8,"duration":1.6},{"text":"[Derek] I'll put a link to the full video here\nand a link to his website in the description.","start":401.74,"duration":3.92},{"text":"So the reason the bike moves backwards is because of the way these gears are set up, the diameter of the tire,","start":405.66,"duration":6.1},{"text":"and also, the distance from this crank to the pedal itself.","start":411.76,"duration":4.26},{"text":"Because as a bike moves forwards,","start":416.3,"duration":3.12},{"text":"the pedal, even when you're pushing back on it, never actually moves backwards with respect to the ground;","start":419.94,"duration":6.06},{"text":"it's always moving forwards.","start":426.0,"duration":2.06},{"text":"[George] So if you drag a string\nbehind the pedal of a bike moving forward,","start":428.06,"duration":4.1},{"text":"the string is always moving forward.","start":432.16,"duration":2.74},{"text":"Now just play that movie backward in your mind,","start":434.9,"duration":2.54},{"text":"and it may be clear how pulling the string backward could make the bike move backward;","start":437.44,"duration":4.1},{"text":"They move forward together,\nso they move backward together.","start":441.54,"duration":2.4},{"text":"[Derek]\nAnother way to think about this","start":443.94,"duration":1.34},{"text":"is to consider the path traced out by the pedal\nas the bike moves forward.","start":445.28,"duration":3.9},{"text":"This is called the trochoid.","start":449.18,"duration":1.88},{"text":"For all ordinary bikes, \nthe pedals are moving much slower than the tires,","start":451.06,"duration":3.8},{"text":"so the pedal is always going forward\nwith respect to the ground,","start":454.86,"duration":3.92},{"text":"but George modified his bike","start":458.78,"duration":1.46},{"text":"so the ratio of the pedal to the wheel radius was greater than the ratio of the front sprocket to the back sprocket,","start":460.24,"duration":6.52},{"text":"and this ultra-low gear changes the trochoid\nso the pedal DOES actually go backwards","start":466.76,"duration":5.18},{"text":"with respect to the ground as the bike goes forwards,","start":471.94,"duration":3.7},{"text":"and that's why he could pull back on the pedal","start":475.64,"duration":1.98},{"text":"and make the bike go forwards.","start":477.62,"duration":2.22},{"text":"This is the same reason why if you were to pull backwards on the flange of a train wheel,","start":479.84,"duration":4.54},{"text":"you could actually get the train to move forwards,\nif you pulled backwards with enough force.","start":484.38,"duration":5.8},{"text":"For all normal bicycles, pulling back like this on the bottom pedal will cause the bicycle to move backwards,","start":490.18,"duration":5.82},{"text":"but, depending on the gear ratio,\nyou can get the bike to move forwards,","start":496.0,"duration":4.26},{"text":"so it was those people who said","start":500.26,"duration":1.88},{"text":"it depends on the ratio of these gears and the size of this crank to the radius of the back

that?","start":75.57,"duration":1.195},{"text":"- 'Cause...","start":76.765,"duration":1.252},{"text":"(boat engine drowns James voice)","start":78.017,"duration":1.833},{"text":"- These are actually\npartially filled with water,","start":79.85,"duration":2.65},{"text":"and the reason they are\nfilled with water is that,","start":82.5,"duration":2.31},{"text":"at LA Reservoir we have\nsome really high winds","start":84.81,"duration":2.12},{"text":"and so, you know, if we didn't\nput water into these things,","start":86.93,"duration":2.73},{"text":"there would be balls down\nbouncing on the 5 Freeway,","start":89.66,"duration":2.09},{"text":"people drive down, they'd\nbe all over the place.","start":91.75,"duration":1.88},{"text":"So, these keep the balls in the reservoir","start":93.63,"duration":2.58},{"text":"and if they do start to roll,","start":96.21,"duration":1.38},{"text":"they kind of wobble because\nthe water makes them uneven.","start":97.59,"duration":2.53},{"text":"- [Narrator] But that\nmakes them significantly","start":100.12,"duration":1.65},{"text":"more difficult to push out of the

the time.","start":176.779,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Most of the time?","start":177.612,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- [Hellen] Yes.","start":178.445,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Most of the time the\nwater is coming from here.","start":179.278,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- [Hellen] Correct, yes.","start":180.111,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Absolutely nuts.","start":180.944,"duration":0.833},{"text":"So why is LA Reservoir\ncovered in shade balls?","start":181.777,"duration":3.823},{"text":"Well, the the problem\nall started with Bromide.","start":185.6,"duration":2.62},{"text":"- Bromide is a naturally\noccurring substance.","start":188.22,"duration":2.62},{"text":"It's associated with salt water","start":190.84,"duration":1.98},{"text":"and so normally places\nlike California Aqueduct,","start":192.82,"duration":4.05},{"text":"that comes down from the Delta.","start":196.87,"duration":1.67},{"text":"You get some some salt water intrusions,","start":198.54,"duration":1.43},{"text":"so you have some Bromide in the water.","start":199.97,"duration":1.54},{"text":"Bromide's harmless and it's\nalmost impossible to remove.","start":201.51,"duration":3.113},{"text":"But, when you disinfect\nthe water with Ozone,","start":204.623,"duration":3.297},{"text":"that Bromide becomes Bromate.","start":207.92,"duration":2.52},{"text":"And Bromate is carcinogenic.","start":210.44,"duration":1.31},{"text":"And so around the year\n2000 they wrote regulations","start":211.75,"duration":3.26},{"text":"regulating Bromate.","start":215.01,"duration":0.95},{"text":"And the regulation basically said,","start":215.96,"duration":1.8},{"text":"if you have a treatment\nplant that uses Ozone,","start":217.76,"duration":2.35},{"text":"then you have to watch\nyour Bromate formation.","start":220.11,"duration":2.76},{"text":"Be careful not to form too much.","start":222.87,"duration":1.21},{"text":"So, the only places we\never measured Bromate","start":224.08,"duration":2.14},{"text":"was at our filter plant.","start":226.22,"duration":1.33},{"text":"- [Narrator] And the results\nwere always within the","start":227.55,"duration":1.65},{"text":"10 micrograms per liter\nlimit set by regulators.","start":229.2,"duration":3.28},{"text":"So they were confused when they got a call","start":232.48,"duration":1.87},{"text":"from one of their customers,\na beverage company in LA.","start":234.35,"duration":3.05},{"text":"- They said, \"We have\nsome really high levels","start":237.4,"duration":1.83},{"text":"of Bromate showing up,\nare you aware of this?\"","start":239.23,"duration":2.01},{"text":"And we said, \"Well, we\ndon't show anything.\"","start":241.24,"duration":2.43},{"text":"- [Narrator] But between\nthe filtration plant","start":243.67,"duration":1.51},{"text":"and the customer was the reservoir.","start":245.18,"duration":2.4},{"text":"So they did some tests.","start":247.58,"duration":2.15},{"text":"- Almost immediately upon coming","start":249.73,"duration":1.4},{"text":"into to this open reservoir,","start":251.13,"duration":1.5},{"text":"the Bromate levels jumped.","start":252.63,"duration":1.97},{"text":"It turned out that Bromide with Chlorine,","start":254.6,"duration":2.94},{"text":"which was supposed to be safe,","start":257.54,"duration":1.42},{"text":"in bright sunlight formed Bromate","start":258.96,"duration":2.32},{"text":"even more than Ozone did.","start":261.28,"duration":1.77},{"text":"And so we made the unfortunate\nscientific discovery","start":263.05,"duration":2.693},{"text":"that actually was not part\nof any regulatory scheme.","start":265.743,"duration":3.267},{"text":"And so, here we are at the reservoir,","start":269.01,"duration":2.39},{"text":"we have a water source that's\ngot Bromide in it, harmless,","start":271.4,"duration":3.12},{"text":"we have chlorine, we have to\nhave to disinfect the water","start":274.52,"duration":2.6},{"text":"and we have sunlight because it's open.","start":277.12,"duration":1.99},{"text":"The only choice we have\nis to remove sunlight.","start":279.11,"duration":1.62},{"text":"So, we looked at all sorts of things.","start":280.73,"duration":1.93},{"text":"We looked at floating\ntarps across the water,","start":282.66,"duration":3.1},{"text":"and normally, you put a\nfloating cover on the water","start":285.76,"duration":1.59},{"text":"but that's a multi-year project.","start":287.35,"duration":2.19},{"text":"And so we said, \"Well, can we manufacture","start":289.54,"duration":1.43},{"text":"these kind of trampoline\nwith poly-like PVC pipe?\"","start":290.97,"duration":3.03},{"text":"And we said, \"Well, they'll\njust gonna become bird perches","start":294.0,"duration":1.75},{"text":"and we'll have a big\nwater quality problem.\"","start":295.75,"duration":1.837},{"text":"Then we knew we had\nhigh-density polyethylene pipe,","start":297.587,"duration":3.823},{"text":"which is used in the water industry,","start":301.41,"duration":1.67},{"text":"and we know that it floats.","start":303.08,"duration":1.84},{"text":"We at one point thought about","start":304.92,"duration":1.19},{"text":"can we get float a pile of\npipe across the surface.","start":306.11,"duration":2.03},{"text":"Well, that's hard to do and very expensive","start":308.14,"duration":2.57},{"text":"'cause it's a lot of material.","start":310.71,"duration":1.44},{"text":"So maybe we can take some pipe","start":312.15,"duration":0.833},{"text":"and we can run it through a chipper","start":312.983,"duration":1.287},{"text":"and we can make a debris\nfield across the surface,","start":314.27,"duration":2.24},{"text":"like the back corner of a lake somewhere.","start":316.51,"duration":2.38},{"text":"But, then you have all\nthis mushy, warm water","start":318.89,"duration":2.3},{"text":"with plastic floating on the top","start":321.19,"duration":1.38},{"text":"and that however sounds like a Petri dish.","start":322.57,"duration":1.87},{"text":"And so low and behold, Dr. Bryan White,","start":324.44,"duration":2.19},{"text":"did some research and\nhe found the shade ball.","start":326.63,"duration":3.294},{"text":"(tranquil music)","start":329.924,"duration":1.766},{"text":"- [Narrator] Except they\nweren't called shade balls","start":331.69,"duration":1.97},{"text":"at the time.","start":333.66,"duration":0.876},{"text":"(tranquil music)","start":334.536,"duration":1.474},{"text":"- This product existed and\nthey were called bird balls","start":336.01,"duration":3.2},{"text":"and they used it on ponds\nthat had mine tailings,","start":339.21,"duration":3.73},{"text":"where they didn't want waterfowl\nto go in and get poisoned.","start":342.94,"duration":2.68},{"text":"And also around airports\nwhere there are ponds","start":345.62,"duration":2.248},{"text":"and they want to keep the waterfowl off","start":347.868,"duration":1.652},{"text":"so they didn't take off\nand get into jet engines.","start":349.52,"duration":2.557},{"text":"(airplane engine roaring)","start":352.077,"duration":2.691},{"text":"You know they have actually\ndone wind tunnel testing","start":354.768,"duration":1.642},{"text":"and they blew, you know,\n50, 60 mile of winds across","start":356.41,"duration":3.041},{"text":"so they could see how they'd behave.","start":359.451,"duration":1.549},{"text":"But, they were really made\nto deter birds and wildlife","start":361.0,"duration":2.27},{"text":"from sitting on the water.","start":363.27,"duration":1.19},{"text":"- [Narrator] Did there used\nto be birds landing here more?","start":364.46,"duration":2.55},{"text":"- Absolutely, yes.","start":367.01,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- [Narrator] Yeah?","start":367.843,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Yeah.","start":368.676,"duration":0.833},{"text":"Once we deployed these balls,","start":369.509,"duration":0.833},{"text":"all the birds were gone.","start":370.342,"duration":1.368},{"text":"They used to just hangout, right?","start":371.71,"duration":2.06},{"text":"Loiter at the curbs.","start":373.77,"duration":1.18},{"text":"- Yeah, they'd be all\nover the top of the dam.","start":374.95,"duration":2.392},{"text":"- [Hellen] You could see\nbirds dropping everywhere.","start":377.342,"duration":1.278},{"text":"- [James] They'd be down\nat the outlet tower,","start":378.62,"duration":2.02},{"text":"they'd be everywhere.","start":380.64,"duration":0.99},{"text":"We don't get 'em anymore like we used to.","start":381.63,"duration":2.48},{"text":"- [Narrator] But before\nbeing added to the reservoir,","start":384.11,"duration":1.67},{"text":"the shade balls had to be tested.","start":385.78,"duration":2.15},{"text":"Would they actually reduce\nthe formation of Bromate?","start":387.93,"duration":2.79},{"text":"- And we bought three kiddie pools,","start":390.72,"duration":1.956},{"text":"three little inflatable kiddie pools.","start":392.676,"duration":1.884},{"text":"And we filled them all\nwith the reservoir water.","start":394.56,"duration":1.99},{"text":"One was in the sunlight,\none we put a tarp on","start":396.55,"duration":1.423},{"text":"and one put shade balls on.","start":397.973,"duration":2.317},{"text":"And amazingly, the shade balls knocked out","start":400.29,"duration":2.15},{"text":"the problem immediately.","start":402.44,"duration":1.79},{"text":"- [Narrator] So the reason\nshade balls are black","start":404.23,"duration":1.84},{"text":"is to block all light\nfrom reaching the water","start":406.07,"duration":2.17},{"text":"and triggering the Bromate reaction.","start":408.24,"duration":2.3},{"text":"The black pigment is also safe","start":410.54,"duration":1.5},{"text":"for contact with drinking water","start":412.04,"duration":1.34},{"text":"and it's stable even exposed\nto the elements for years.","start":413.38,"duration":3.76},{"text":"- They're black for a reason so, you know,","start":417.14,"duration":2.06},{"text":"they're made out of a\nhigh-density polyethylene.","start":419.2,"duration":1.94},{"text":"It's the same material that","start":421.14,"duration":1.42},{"text":"like a gallon milk jug is made out of.","start":422.56,"duration":2.0},{"text":"It's a food grade plastic","start":424.56,"duration":1.59},{"text":"and they would be clear\nlike a milk carton,","start":426.15,"duration":2.04},{"text":"except that they wouldn't last in the sun.","start":428.19,"duration":2.1},{"text":"And so, they have a material\ncalled carbon black in them","start":430.29,"duration":2.66},{"text":"and that's what makes the plastic last","start":432.95,"duration":2.28},{"text":"for at least 10 years out in the sun.","start":435.23,"duration":1.58},{"text":"We did test to see","start":436.81,"duration":1.146},{"text":"if there is any other colors we could use.","start":437.956,"duration":1.934},{"text":"So we actually had the company make","start":439.89,"duration":2.2},{"text":"three different shades of blue,","start":442.09,"duration":1.11},{"text":"but the dyes were so unstable they said,","start":443.2,"duration":2.197},{"text":"\"We can't guarantee it's\ngonna last more than a year.\"","start":445.397,"duration":2.183},{"text":"And so, it's that carbon black","start":447.58,"duration":1.567},{"text":"that's the magic powder in this","start":449.147,"duration":2.173},{"text":"that really makes this\nproduct last in the sunlight.","start":451.32,"duration":2.35},{"text":"One of the concerns\nthat people raised to me","start":453.67,"duration":2.03},{"text":"when we put first these on, it was that,","start":455.7,"duration":2.2},{"text":"are they gonna get hot and\nthen bleach the material out?","start":457.9,"duration":2.47},{"text":"And they don't.","start":460.37,"duration":0.833},{"text":"They're totally inert.","start":461.203,"duration":0.947},{"text":"I mean, theoretically, you could cut off","start":462.15,"duration":1.41},{"text":"a piece of this ball\nand you could chew it,","start":463.56,"duration":1.8},{"text":"no harm comes to you.","start":465.36,"duration":0.92},{"text":"This is totally food grade,","start":466.28,"duration":1.98},{"text":"nothing wrong with it whatsoever.","start":468.26,"duration":1.213},{"text":"- [Narrator] What's it like\ndriving through these things?","start":469.473,"duration":1.723},{"text":"- It's difficult.","start":471.196,"duration":1.514},{"text":"As you can see we've\nbeen sitting here for,","start":472.71,"duration":1.915},{"text":"well, I don't know how\nlong, quite a while,","start":474.625,"duration":2.165},{"text":"and there's a breeze and we haven't moved.","start":476.79,"duration":2.29},{"text":"I mean anybody that knows,","start":479.08,"duration":0.96},{"text":"that's been on a boat in a lake,","start":480.04,"duration":1.21},{"text":"if there's a slight breeze\nand you're on a boat,","start":481.25,"duration":1.71},{"text":"you're drifting, right?","start":482.96,"duration":1.45},{"text":"Not here.","start":484.41,"duration":0.833},{"text":"This thing, they're just stable.","start":485.243,"duration":2.527},{"text":"They're (indistinct)","start":487.77,"duration":1.5},{"text":"It's interesting when\nyou try to pilot the boat","start":489.27,"duration":2.07},{"text":"through these things, its difficult.","start":491.34,"duration":1.56},{"text":"- [Narrator] It's like\ndriving through peanut butter","start":492.9,"duration":1.05},{"text":"or something?","start":493.95,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Or something, I guess, yeah.","start":494.783,"duration":1.247},{"text":"Not that I've ever done that but...","start":496.03,"duration":1.409},{"text":"(laughing)","start":497.439,"duration":1.121},{"text":"- [Narrator] Blocking\nsunlight from the reservoir","start":498.56,"duration":1.69},{"text":"also provided additional benefits.","start":500.25,"duration":2.37},{"text":"- You know, one of the reasons\nwe put so much Chlorine","start":502.62,"duration":1.75},{"text":"was to control the algae growth.","start":504.37,"duration":1.3},{"text":"But sometimes you still\ncouldn't control it.","start":505.67,"duration":2.07},{"text":"There were times years ago, in the summer,","start":507.74,"duration":2.56},{"text":"where if we had an algae outbreak,","start":510.3,"duration":1.93},{"text":"you might actually, if\nyou filled a bath tub up,","start":512.23,"duration":2.01},{"text":"you might have a slight tinge of green.","start":514.24,"duration":1.48},{"text":"I mean, it maybe healthy to drink,","start":515.72,"duration":1.5},{"text":"but it might have a slight\ntinge of green from the algae.","start":517.22,"duration":1.84},{"text":"- [Narrator] You'd see a bit of algae.","start":519.06,"duration":0.833},{"text":"- Yeah, and it's just\ndiscoloring the water.","start":519.893,"duration":1.517},{"text":"That no longer occurs.","start":521.41,"duration":0.97},{"text":"So, with the sunlight gone,","start":522.38,"duration":2.33},{"text":"the algae problem is gone.","start":524.71,"duration":1.46},{"text":"We put in, basically, no Chlorine.","start":526.17,"duration":1.27},{"text":"We've only had a few times\nsince the shade balls","start":527.44,"duration":2.03},{"text":"have been on LA Reservoir,","start":529.47,"duration":0.833},{"text":"that we've added any Chlorine at all.","start":530.303,"duration":1.577},{"text":"And we used to do half the Chlorine","start":531.88,"duration":1.37},{"text":"and the whole water system","start":533.25,"duration":1.26},{"text":"went into that reservoir\njust to control algae growth.","start":534.51,"duration":2.63},{"text":"- [Narrator] But the big\nconcern I had was evaporation.","start":537.14,"duration":3.18},{"text":"When I first heard about\nthese black plastic balls","start":540.32,"duration":2.29},{"text":"reducing evaporation, it\ndidn't seem to make any sense.","start":542.61,"duration":3.23},{"text":"I mean, wouldn't they absorb more energy","start":545.84,"duration":2.02},{"text":"and so heat up the water,\nleading to faster evaporation?","start":547.86,"duration":3.407},{"text":"It turns out the answer is, no,","start":551.267,"duration":1.933},{"text":"for a number of reasons.","start":553.2,"duration":1.87},{"text":"In an open reservoir, there\nis more exposed surface area","start":555.07,"duration":2.75},{"text":"where water molecules\ncan escape into the air.","start":557.82,"duration":2.65},{"text":"Plus, there is greater air\nflow over the water's surface","start":560.47,"duration":2.66},{"text":"continually removing\nthe layer of moist air","start":563.13,"duration":2.26},{"text":"and replacing it with dryer\nair, increasing evaporation.","start":565.39,"duration":3.69},{"text":"Now the shade balls do absorb more energy","start":569.08,"duration":2.29},{"text":"and get hotter on

research from collaborating groups\nof physicist and biologists at the University","start":76.679,"duration":4.11},{"text":"of Geneva shows that this is incorrect.","start":80.789,"duration":3.481},{"text":"Now the first clue should come from the fact\nthat there is actually no green pigment in","start":84.27,"duration":4.279},{"text":"the a chameleon.","start":88.549,"duration":1.081},{"text":"The green color actually created by two distinct\nmechanisms, pigment color and structural color.","start":89.63,"duration":6.619},{"text":"Beneath the yellow pigment cells, there are\ncells containing tiny 130 nm crystals regularly","start":96.249,"duration":6.07},{"text":"arranged in a lattice.","start":102.319,"duration":1.78},{"text":"Now light diffracts off these crystals and\ndue to the spacing between them, blue light","start":104.099,"duration":4.361},{"text":"constructively interferes and is therefore\nstrongly reflected.","start":108.46,"duration":3.79},{"text":"Whereas the other colors are not reflected.","start":112.25,"duration":2.78},{"text":"This is very similar to how a morpho butterfly\nwing creates an iridescent blue.","start":115.03,"duration":4.819},{"text":"There is no blue pigment just the periodic\nnanoscale structure that acts as a strong","start":119.849,"duration":4.72},{"text":"reflector for only one color.","start":124.569,"duration":2.73},{"text":"So a chameleon looks green due to the combination\nof the yellow light from the pigment plus","start":127.299,"duration":4.541},{"text":"the blue light reflected off the crystal structure\nbeneath it.","start":131.84,"duration":3.28},{"text":"So how do chameleons change this green into\nyellow orange and red?","start":135.12,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Well previously it was assumed that the color\nchange was achieved by dispersing pigments","start":139.67,"duration":4.39},{"text":"in the colored cells.","start":144.06,"duration":1.75},{"text":"But now scientists have found it's actually\nthe crystals underneath which are changing.","start":145.81,"duration":5.22},{"text":"By increasing the spacing between the crystals\nthe chameleons can change which color is selectively","start":151.03,"duration":6.11},{"text":"reflected.","start":157.14,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Bigger gaps between the crystals are better\nat reflecting longer wavelengths.","start":158.14,"duration":4.08},{"text":"So as the spacing increases, the color changes\nfrom blue to green to yellow, and then orange","start":162.22,"duration":7.29},{"text":"and red.","start":169.51,"duration":1.67},{"text":"Scientists compared skin samples from calm\ngreen chameleons and excited yellow chameleons","start":171.18,"duration":4.55},{"text":"and found that indeed, in the excited chameleon\nthe crystal spacing was much further apart.","start":175.73,"duration":6.44},{"text":"Here you can see a single cell enlarged and\nthe color it reflects changing from blue to","start":182.17,"duration":5.46},{"text":"green to yellow, orange and red.","start":187.63,"duration":3.37},{"text":"Plus, a computer simulation of the light reflected\noff crystals while their spacing is decreasing","start":191.0,"duration":6.15},{"text":"also provides excellent agreement with these\nobservations.","start":197.15,"duration":3.13},{"text":"Furthermore, applying physical pressure to\nthe skin causes the crystals to compress and","start":200.28,"duration":5.26},{"text":"so they reflect more blue.","start":205.54,"duration":2.08},{"text":"When that pressure is removed, the crystals\nexpand again reflecting more green light.","start":207.62,"duration":5.199},{"text":"The structure of a chameleon\u2019s skin gets\neven more fascinating, as there is another","start":212.819,"duration":4.301},{"text":"layer of cells underneath which also contain\ncrystals.","start":217.12,"duration":3.7},{"text":"But these crystals are larger more spaced\nout and more disorganized.","start":220.82,"duration":5.17},{"text":"This means they reflect longer wavelengths\nin the infrared part of the spectrum and they","start":225.99,"duration":4.33},{"text":"reflect

since","start":232.83,"duration":4.3},{"text":"these chameleons live in bright full-sun habitats.","start":237.13,"duration":3.75},{"text":"So male chameleons don't change their color\nby spreading out red and yellow pigments.","start":240.88,"duration":5.53},{"text":"Instead they do something much more remarkable.","start":246.41,"duration":2.62},{"text":"They actively tune the spacing between
