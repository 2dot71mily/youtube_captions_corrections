understands","start":427.179,"duration":7.02},{"text":"okay but there are a few tricks that","start":428.379,"duration":8.58},{"text":"have come up through a combination

end-to-end","start":1702.539,"duration":3.12},{"text":"so the complication here of course is","start":1703.53,"duration":5.759},{"text":"the fact that the parameters are on the","start":1705.659,"duration":5.13},{"text":"first box how do you know how to turn","start":1709.289,"duration":3.451},{"text":"them so that the output does you

it's","start":1749.669,"duration":8.151},{"text":"actually a point but it's a manual point","start":1753.51,"duration":4.31},{"text":"so since they have to be nonlinear

nonlinear","start":1771.99,"duration":5.0},{"text":"and your eyes quickly that it has to","start":1778.14,"duration":9.18},{"text":"look something like this so take

to","start":5602.82,"duration":9.84},{"text":"motivation it's again the surface area","start":5606.48,"duration":7.8},{"text":"of the person right so it's bounded

more","start":5793.04,"duration":7.639},{"text":"questions if there is any","start":5797.03,"duration":3.649},{"text":"yes okay so the question is is there","start":5804.01,"duration":12.72},{"text":"some sort of pre-processing like PC air","start":5815.17,"duration":4.41},{"text":"that will find those vectors yeah so PCI","start":5816.73,"duration":6.27},{"text":"will find those if the manifold is","start":5819.58,"duration":6.11},{"text":"linear so if you assume that the surface","start":5823.0,"duration":5.37},{"text":"occupied by all those examples or faces","start":5825.69,"duration":7.12},{"text":"is a plane then PCA will find the","start":5828.37,"duration":6.39},{"text":"dimension of that plane principal","start":5832.81,"duration":6.75},{"text":"component analysis right but no it's not","start":5834.76,"duration":12.72},{"text":"linear unfortunately right let me yeah","start":5839.56,"duration":11.22},{"text":"let me give you an example if you take","start":5847.48,"duration":5.07},{"text":"me and my older son that looks like me","start":5850.78,"duration":5.58},{"text":"and you place us to making the same

my","start":5860.92,"duration":6.63},{"text":"face shifted by 20 pixels there's more","start":5863.62,"duration":6.21},{"text":"distance between me and myself shifted","start":5867.55,"duration":5.84},{"text":"than there is between me and my son okay","start":5869.83,"duration":9.57},{"text":"so what that means is that you know the","start":5873.39,"duration":7.39},{"text":"manifold of my face you know is some","start":5879.4,"duration":3.21},{"text":"complicated manifold in that space my","start":5880.78,"duration":3.3},{"text":"son is a very different manifold which","start":5882.61,"duration":5.22},{"text":"does not intersect mine yet these

another","start":5897.64,"duration":7.05},{"text":"reason why that that surface is not is","start":5901.81,"duration":5.88},{"text":"not a plane you're looking at me right","start":5904.69,"duration":5.43},{"text":"now I imagine the manifold which is a","start":5907.69,"duration":4.17},{"text":"linear manifold one dimensional manifold","start":5910.12,"duration":5.66},{"text":"of me turning my head all the way 360","start":5911.86,"duration":8.49},{"text":"okay that manifold is

is","start":5924.57,"duration":5.82},{"text":"not going to find it","start":5927.85,"duration":2.54},{"text":"okay I gotta blast off thanks to you","start":5931.63,"duration":5.09},{"text":"next

things","start":199.84,"duration":3.84},{"text":"don't quite work but you still apply","start":202.09,"duration":2.759},{"text":"yourselves so that's actually

I","start":250.329,"duration":6.421},{"text":"take a picture of these of something","start":254.859,"duration":3.66},{"text":"right let's say I take a picture","start":256.75,"duration":5.849},{"text":"if one one megapixel camera so how","start":258.519,"duration":7.261},{"text":"many dimension will be my image so if I","start":262.599,"duration":5.16},{"text":"take an image I can consider my image","start":265.78,"duration":5.19},{"text":"which is gonna have RGB plane and

3","start":281.169,"duration":7.081},{"text":"million right ok cool so you can think","start":286.389,"duration":4.56},{"text":"about this image which can be thought

dog","start":323.469,"duration":7.25},{"text":"who thinks the cut the other one is here","start":326.05,"duration":7.859},{"text":"ok maybe you were actually paying","start":330.719,"duration":5.38},{"text":"attention yesterday who were thinking","start":333.909,"duration":4.171},{"text":"who thinks the other point is gonna be","start":336.099,"duration":5.07},{"text":"here okay who thinks the other point is","start":338.08,"duration":6.179},{"text":"gonna be here fantastic ok so you","start":341.169,"duration":5.22},{"text":"actually on the right thing so","start":344.259,"duration":3.84},{"text":"everything is just in the same

very","start":439.41,"duration":6.15},{"text":"nice in this book introduction to linear","start":443.31,"duration":4.86},{"text":"algebra by Gilbert Strang so you may","start":445.56,"duration":5.55},{"text":"want to you know look up this stuff but","start":448.17,"duration":5.64},{"text":"the other one is this one here so you'd","start":451.11,"duration":4.5},{"text":"like to check the third tweet here where","start":453.81,"duration":3.75},{"text":"I show you the essence of linear algebra","start":455.61,"duration":5.82},{"text":"by I grant maybe you know this guy Brian","start":457.56,"duration":6.27},{"text":"Sanders if you don't know well you","start":461.43,"duration":5.4},{"text":"should know now just check this link","start":463.83,"duration":4.41},{"text":"right and this link is going to show you","start":466.83,"duration":5.19},{"text":"how you move stuff around okay anyhow it","start":468.24,"duration":6.57},{"text":"was the first link for today so how do","start":472.02,"duration":5.4},{"text":"you move things around in a space for","start":474.81,"duration":3.93},{"text":"the one actually didn't know how the","start":477.42,"duration":4.95},{"text":"energy linear algebra works you just","start":478.74,"duration":8.88},{"text":"talk it down raise their hands huh okay","start":482.37,"duration":8.24},{"text":"matrix multiplication buddha's edo","start":487.62,"duration":7.41},{"text":"rotation and here","start":490.61,"duration":6.79},{"text":"okay first matrix multiplication is a","start":495.03,"duration":5.34},{"text":"what kind of variation leaden","start":497.4,"duration":4.56},{"text":"transformation okay what are the linear","start":500.37,"duration":11.39},{"text":"transformation one rotation to you sure","start":501.96,"duration":14.09},{"text":"straighten okay fantastic then third","start":511.76,"duration":7.13},{"text":"stretching scaling I guess let's see","start":516.05,"duration":7.359},{"text":"scaling stretching this number two then","start":518.89,"duration":4.519},{"text":"if the determinant is negative what do","start":523.5,"duration":13.269},{"text":"you have what is it a reflection third","start":526.149,"duration":18.511},{"text":"and then one more is it okay I guess we","start":536.769,"duration":9.931},{"text":"have three for the moment this should be","start":544.66,"duration":3.15},{"text":"one more hold on","start":546.7,"duration":3.69},{"text":"so scaling right so you have scaling","start":547.81,"duration":5.55},{"text":"this way he has scaling in that way then","start":550.39,"duration":5.129},{"text":"you have rotation then you have","start":553.36,"duration":4.59},{"text":"reflection if there when you have","start":555.519,"duration":7.26},{"text":"reflection nano identity does nothing","start":557.95,"duration":5.34},{"text":"right","start":562.779,"duration":3.961},{"text":"so okay rotation means

scaling","start":569.95,"duration":7.889},{"text":"okay well I wish you in fantastic so we","start":573.959,"duration":5.201},{"text":"have at the four right so we have","start":577.839,"duration":3.331},{"text":"rotation we have zoom in this way you","start":579.16,"duration":3.72},{"text":"have shearing right and then you have","start":581.17,"duration":4.109},{"text":"the reflection whenever you have the","start":582.88,"duration":6.81},{"text":"negative determinant cool still I want","start":585.279,"duration":7.55},{"text":"you to move things around is motion","start":589.69,"duration":11.389},{"text":"translation is a linear operation no

if","start":613.029,"duration":5.041},{"text":"the 0 is mapped to 0 then you have a","start":616.48,"duration":2.52},{"text":"linear transformation","start":618.07,"duration":3.36},{"text":"anyhow so you have translation which is","start":619.0,"duration":4.14},{"text":"the fourth one at a fifth operation if","start":621.43,"duration":4.019},{"text":"you use affine transformations so all","start":623.14,"duration":4.17},{"text":"those nice things you're gonna be fine","start":625.449,"duration":4.741},{"text":"them there ok so check those things are","start":627.31,"duration":5.73},{"text":"very useful anyhow so finally we figure","start":630.19,"duration":6.06},{"text":"out that if I have everything up here we","start":633.04,"duration":5.82},{"text":"have cut hippopotamus dogs and whatever","start":636.25,"duration":6.35},{"text":"I want to take them down I want to","start":638.86,"duration":6.479},{"text":"translate right yes","start":642.6,"duration":6.37},{"text":"talk to me no you don't talk yet ok all","start":645.339,"duration":5.911},{"text":"right so we want to use translation and","start":648.97,"duration":3.36},{"text":"then you translate this","start":651.25,"duration":2.88},{"text":"in the z-row so you have all the things","start":652.33,"duration":3.57},{"text":"here then how do you separate those","start":654.13,"duration":6.48},{"text":"things apart so all of them are tall","start":655.9,"duration":10.2},{"text":"together how can i we mentioned what are","start":660.61,"duration":7.64},{"text":"the five different a four

how","start":679.78,"duration":5.91},{"text":"do we diagonalize matrices ha that is","start":683.32,"duration":4.53},{"text":"the second question you can figure out","start":685.69,"duration":5.49},{"text":"if you check Twitter so we open a new","start":687.85,"duration":7.53},{"text":"page we go Twitter again we go on top","start":691.18,"duration":7.26},{"text":"right should take a note about how to do","start":695.38,"duration":6.45},{"text":"this stuff you don't SVD parentheses","start":698.44,"duration":8.94},{"text":"from all the NZ okay cool","start":701.83,"duration":10.35},{"text":"now you go if you go here is like or SVD","start":707.38,"duration":8.04},{"text":"so this is from also Gilbert right so","start":712.18,"duration":4.8},{"text":"you also like to check these on if you","start":715.42,"duration":3.09},{"text":"click here it's gonna be more","start":716.98,"duration":3.3},{"text":"information about me term right","start":718.51,"duration":4.89},{"text":"last year oh okay you know too much no","start":720.28,"duration":5.4},{"text":"okay anyhow so you want to check this","start":723.4,"duration":4.74},{"text":"stuff out anyhow we'll figure out that","start":725.68,"duration":5.13},{"text":"by using matrices and scalars you can","start":728.14,"duration":5.1},{"text":"move things around and then you can zoom","start":730.81,"duration":4.95},{"text":"right and so again I have things all","start":733.24,"duration":4.95},{"text":"collapsed here I can't do anything so I","start":735.76,"duration":4.97},{"text":"take it down with a translation right","start":738.19,"duration":5.33},{"text":"yes no make do like that with your head","start":740.73,"duration":8.32},{"text":"no you follow in there yes no okay","start":743.52,"duration":9.19},{"text":"it's boring no okay alright so you take","start":749.05,"duration":4.77},{"text":"a reason you put it down with","start":752.71,"duration":3.51},{"text":"translation and then you zoom it right","start":753.82,"duration":4.4},{"text":"with a matrix perhaps diagonal with some","start":756.22,"duration":5.97},{"text":"singular values right cool cool cool","start":758.22,"duration":6.91},{"text":"and then what so I have this thing","start":762.19,"duration":5.67},{"text":"zoomed up though so classification what","start":765.13,"duration":6.45},{"text":"is it how do you perform classification","start":767.86,"duration":10.53},{"text":"now you I'd like you'd like to assign","start":771.58,"duration":9.93},{"text":"labels but how do you do that so","start":778.39,"duration":4.65},{"text":"whatever you would like to do is going","start":781.51,"duration":3.06},{"text":"to be basically moving these points in","start":783.04,"duration":2.59},{"text":"different regions","start":784.57,"duration":3.46},{"text":"and then you slice them okay and so this","start":785.63,"duration":3.84},{"text":"is problem is gonna be part of the next","start":788.03,"duration":3.45},{"text":"class and now I'm just showing you how a","start":789.47,"duration":5.7},{"text":"neural network does this I hope you're","start":791.48,"duration":7.2},{"text":"gonna be enjoying this video if I find","start":795.17,"duration":13.47},{"text":"my cursor okay so all right so we start","start":798.68,"duration":13.29},{"text":"from here for screen perhaps all right","start":808.64,"duration":6.21},{"text":"so can you see anything no how do you","start":811.97,"duration":3.66},{"text":"turn off the lights","start":814.85,"duration":3.78},{"text":"can someone figure out how to oh maybe","start":815.63,"duration":15.39},{"text":"here yes no good night hold on all right","start":818.63,"duration":16.53},{"text":"good night so at least then I'd turn it","start":831.02,"duration":6.42},{"text":"back so here we start with these five","start":835.16,"duration":4.62},{"text":"branches of a spiral and you can see","start":837.44,"duration":4.76},{"text":"that each point is gonna be basically","start":839.78,"duration":5.19},{"text":"represented as what how can you","start":842.2,"duration":4.3},{"text":"represent each of those points without","start":844.97,"duration":7.23},{"text":"the color okay where do these points","start":846.5,"duration":9.3},{"text":"live on a 2d plane right so this is a 2d","start":852.2,"duration":5.85},{"text":"plane this screen here so each of those","start":855.8,"duration":7.68},{"text":"points is represented as a is a tuple","start":858.05,"duration":7.26},{"text":"right that is representing the X and the","start":863.48,"duration":3.84},{"text":"y coordinate then the color there","start":865.31,"duration":4.92},{"text":"represents a third dimension where it's","start":867.32,"duration":4.26},{"text":"going to be basically representing the","start":870.23,"duration":2.88},{"text":"class to which each of those points","start":871.58,"duration":3.27},{"text":"belong and here we have five different","start":873.11,"duration":4.29},{"text":"branches of a spiral so this is the","start":874.85,"duration":3.9},{"text":"input to my network is going to be a","start":877.4,"duration":4.08},{"text":"bunch of points without colors and then","start":878.75,"duration":4.89},{"text":"I ask my network to separate the points","start":881.48,"duration":4.32},{"text":"by color okay is it clear what is the","start":883.64,"duration":5.28},{"text":"task I ask my network you can authorize","start":885.8,"duration":4.98},{"text":"your hands because I cannot I cannot see","start":888.92,"duration":3.55},{"text":"it right so","start":890.78,"duration":4.06},{"text":"so you have to shout back because I","start":892.47,"duration":5.7},{"text":"don't see you you understand right","start":894.84,"duration":5.04},{"text":"what's going on here if sorry not right","start":898.17,"duration":3.84},{"text":"now so we start with this guy here which","start":899.88,"duration":6.15},{"text":"is just five branches of a spiral the","start":902.01,"duration":5.46},{"text":"network doesn't see the colors right now","start":906.03,"duration":3.33},{"text":"and the network will try to separate the","start":907.47,"duration":5.25},{"text":"colors apart so this is what my network","start":909.36,"duration":7.35},{"text":"does it takes the space the space space","start":912.72,"duration":6.27},{"text":"fabric and it performs like a stretching","start":916.71,"duration":4.26},{"text":"of the space fabric right how cool does","start":918.99,"duration":7.37},{"text":"that sound and you should do like oh oh","start":920.97,"duration":8.67},{"text":"see okay yeah we had to do multiple","start":926.36,"duration":5.41},{"text":"iterations I think here this your first","start":929.64,"duration":4.89},{"text":"class it's okay to be shy alright so","start":931.77,"duration":4.23},{"text":"this is my network which is basically","start":934.53,"duration":3.96},{"text":"stretching the space fabric in order to","start":936.0,"duration":4.5},{"text":"get all those points that are belonging","start":938.49,"duration":4.35},{"text":"to the same color to the same class to","start":940.5,"duration":5.1},{"text":"be in the same subspace of this final","start":942.84,"duration":6.06},{"text":"manifold such that once we reach","start":945.6,"duration":5.22},{"text":"convergence so whenever we reach at the","start":948.9,"duration":5.37},{"text":"end of this animation you have all your","start":950.82,"duration":7.34},{"text":"points that belongs to different spirals","start":954.27,"duration":8.04},{"text":"very separable and so now you can just","start":958.16,"duration":6.49},{"text":"use logistic regression right or like","start":962.31,"duration":4.53},{"text":"one versus all whatever regression is","start":964.65,"duration":6.06},{"text":"called yeah I don't know so I mean this","start":966.84,"duration":6.45},{"text":"is the last matrix is represented by","start":970.71,"duration":6.48},{"text":"that that for five arrows there so of","start":973.29,"duration":5.79},{"text":"those five arrows represent a matrix","start":977.19,"duration":5.45},{"text":"which is how many rows how many columns","start":979.08,"duration":6.39},{"text":"so what is my output dimension here of","start":982.64,"duration":6.04},{"text":"this network what are we trying to infer","start":985.47,"duration":6.57},{"text":"in this case the classes how many","start":988.68,"duration":6.6},{"text":"classes do we have five so the number of","start":992.04,"duration":8.61},{"text":"rows of this matrix will be five right","start":995.28,"duration":7.05},{"text":"because they are height of the matrix is","start":1000.65,"duration":3.72},{"text":"they the same dimension where you shoot","start":1002.33,"duration":4.38},{"text":"in two and the width of the matrix","start":1004.37,"duration":4.469},{"text":"represents the space where you're","start":1006.71,"duration":4.29},{"text":"shooting from right and so what is going","start":1008.839,"duration":3.781},{"text":"to be what's going to be my width of","start":1011.0,"duration":5.49},{"text":"this matrix - right so this matrix is","start":1012.62,"duration":5.61},{"text":"going to be a high times two because we","start":1016.49,"duration":3.54},{"text":"are shooting towards five dimensions the","start":1018.23,"duration":4.02},{"text":"five colors over here and then we have","start":1020.03,"duration":2.76},{"text":"to","start":1022.25,"duration":3.28},{"text":"two columns right so it's gonna be","start":1022.79,"duration":4.45},{"text":"basically the two coordinates of the tip","start":1025.53,"duration":4.56},{"text":"of the arrow and those are just centered","start":1027.24,"duration":5.16},{"text":"in zero we're going to talk about more","start":1030.09,"duration":4.83},{"text":"about that intersection I guess in later","start":1032.4,"duration":4.62},{"text":"lessons if I actually may manage to make","start":1034.92,"duration":5.55},{"text":"a video about that but can you see that","start":1037.02,"duration":6.83},{"text":"kind of cute intersection at the center","start":1040.47,"duration":5.28},{"text":"have you ever seen that kind of","start":1043.85,"duration":5.77},{"text":"intersection before have you ever taken","start":1045.75,"duration":8.94},{"text":"a bath I mean oh yeah bubbles right so","start":1049.62,"duration":6.24},{"text":"whenever you have multiple bubbles","start":1054.69,"duration":3.81},{"text":"touching together it looks like similar","start":1055.86,"duration":4.95},{"text":"to that perhaps maybe not that I don't","start":1058.5,"duration":4.47},{"text":"know it looks to me alright so that was","start":1060.81,"duration":4.95},{"text":"the first Network okay and this is how","start":1062.97,"duration":4.95},{"text":"this network work these networks","start":1065.76,"duration":4.74},{"text":"basically take the space fabric and then","start":1067.92,"duration":4.92},{"text":"apply some kind of transformation which","start":1070.5,"duration":4.56},{"text":"is still parametrized by matrices so I","start":1072.84,"duration":5.54},{"text":"have many many matrices then I have","start":1075.06,"duration":6.54},{"text":"nonlinearities why do I need many","start":1078.38,"duration":6.07},{"text":"matrices or why do I need nonlinearities","start":1081.6,"duration":4.32},{"text":"can I turn on the light oh you still","start":1084.45,"duration":5.97},{"text":"like to watch okay yeah otherwise start","start":1085.92,"duration":10.59},{"text":"flipping all right so so here it","start":1090.42,"duration":7.65},{"text":"basically this guy here is gonna be a","start":1096.51,"duration":3.75},{"text":"network with two matrices my first","start":1098.07,"duration":5.46},{"text":"matrix Maps my input which is living in","start":1100.26,"duration":7.05},{"text":"which space two dimensions to a","start":1103.53,"duration":7.29},{"text":"intermediate layer of 100 dimensions so","start":1107.31,"duration":6.36},{"text":"my network architecture is the following","start":1110.82,"duration":6.96},{"text":"so I have my two neurons here I met this","start":1113.67,"duration":8.19},{"text":"one two one two three so on here I have","start":1117.78,"duration":9.0},{"text":"100 then I have some non-linearity which","start":1121.86,"duration":6.48},{"text":"is going to be just the positive part","start":1126.78,"duration":6.63},{"text":"and then from this guy here I do","start":1128.34,"duration":7.89},{"text":"something cute or funny or weird I don't","start":1133.41,"duration":5.81},{"text":"know depends so from here I map down to","start":1136.23,"duration":5.31},{"text":"okay what should I do after let's say","start":1139.22,"duration":4.42},{"text":"this is this is my network what's gonna","start":1141.54,"duration":5.25},{"text":"be the last layer of this network Phi","start":1143.64,"duration":5.55},{"text":"right but how many dimension has this","start":1146.79,"duration":7.09},{"text":"screen so how can I plot","start":1149.19,"duration":18.15},{"text":"I don't say PCIe so I do listen okay","start":1153.88,"duration":13.46},{"text":"such that I can show you there the","start":1170.13,"duration":4.57},{"text":"intervener interpolation between this","start":1172.809,"duration":4.11},{"text":"point here which I call embedding in","start":1174.7,"duration":4.62},{"text":"this case but just a way I call this","start":1176.919,"duration":16.701},{"text":"stuff right now and my input okay","start":1179.32,"duration":14.3},{"text":"alright that's pretty much it so this is","start":1193.65,"duration":5.92},{"text":"my neural network has one input layer","start":1196.36,"duration":6.54},{"text":"one hidden layer one kind of embedding","start":1199.57,"duration":5.7},{"text":"layer which does nothing and a output","start":1202.9,"duration":4.8},{"text":"layer okay so it has one hidden and","start":1205.27,"duration":4.35},{"text":"overall I count this as three layer","start":1207.7,"duration":3.87},{"text":"neural network exact because it is one","start":1209.62,"duration":4.35},{"text":"two and then this stuff is linear right","start":1211.57,"duration":6.71},{"text":"so why do we need nonlinearities and","start":1213.97,"duration":4.31},{"text":"what can one layer okay said without","start":1221.37,"duration":5.71},{"text":"non-linearity it would look like a","start":1225.19,"duration":4.26},{"text":"single layer neural network and a single","start":1227.08,"duration":5.719},{"text":"layer neural net or what can you do","start":1229.45,"duration":3.349},{"text":"scaling translation rotation the","start":1234.78,"duration":11.91},{"text":"reflection and I guess shearing right","start":1242.53,"duration":6.69},{"text":"okay so I guess what's going to be the","start":1246.69,"duration":8.109},{"text":"next part of this class let's let's","start":1249.22,"duration":7.89},{"text":"check how one one linear one network","start":1254.799,"duration":4.711},{"text":"with one layer works okay questions so","start":1257.11,"duration":8.28},{"text":"far also there in the yeah for just","start":1259.51,"duration":8.549},{"text":"displaying stuff on the screen more","start":1265.39,"duration":4.62},{"text":"questions again don't raise hands you","start":1268.059,"duration":7.141},{"text":"can just talk to me can you hear me the","start":1270.01,"duration":5.789},{"text":"over there","start":1275.2,"duration":3.78},{"text":"is everything okay awesome alright thank","start":1275.799,"duration":6.021},{"text":"you for approval","start":1278.98,"duration":2.84},{"text":"so these two points here represent the","start":1286.24,"duration":4.9},{"text":"coordinates of my input points right so","start":1289.19,"duration":3.599},{"text":"this is gonna be my x-coordinate my","start":1291.14,"duration":4.56},{"text":"y-coordinate of the input space this

is","start":2466.83,"duration":4.65},{"text":"what's happening it's gonna kill one","start":2470.339,"duration":2.851},{"text":"dimension this one didn't kill it

get","start":2492.39,"duration":3.57},{"text":"this stuff here Oh something else hold","start":2493.77,"duration":5.01},{"text":"on so here you have blue green yellow","start":2495.96,"duration":6.54},{"text":"red right so our our G alone no there is","start":2498.78,"duration":5.22},{"text":"no order here we have blue green yellow","start":2502.5,"duration":4.609},{"text":"red and then here you have blue red","start":2504.0,"duration":5.4},{"text":"yellow green so what's happened here","start":2507.109,"duration":6.161},{"text":"how's the determinant negative why is","start":2509.4,"duration":9.66},{"text":"that because you had a reflection

things right so you have","start":2521.88,"duration":4.56},{"text":"more potatoes here and this is actually","start":2524.82,"duration":4.43},{"text":"zooming a lot you have one point three","start":2526.44,"duration":6.02},{"text":"this also is kind of zooming a little","start":2529.25,"duration":7.45},{"text":"okay this one does nothing okay","start":2532.46,"duration":7.87},{"text":"boring right oh okay what's happen here","start":2536.7,"duration":8.13},{"text":"how are these metrics it's gonna be","start":2540.33,"duration":6.09},{"text":"singular right almost you can see the","start":2544.83,"duration":3.269},{"text":"one singular value is gonna be zero","start":2546.42,"duration":3.57},{"text":"point zero three it's very tiny you can","start":2548.099,"duration":3.661},{"text":"see these are the unit vectors there

6","start":2553.98,"duration":4.44},{"text":"the other one is 0 0 3 so you can","start":2556.29,"duration":5.12},{"text":"basically almost killed a dimension

then","start":2584.269,"duration":5.911},{"text":"linear means doesn't mean a linear","start":2587.089,"duration":5.45},{"text":"transformation because these people were","start":2590.18,"duration":5.76},{"text":"guest programmers so you know they don't","start":2592.539,"duration":5.591},{"text":"know I guess this is an

said","start":2600.14,"duration":3.389},{"text":"bias equals false okay so this is","start":2601.279,"duration":4.441},{"text":"actually just a matrix multiplication so","start":2603.529,"duration":4.29},{"text":"it is a linear transformation okay maps","start":2605.72,"duration":5.46},{"text":"to 0 to 0 then I do model to device I","start":2607.819,"duration":6.151},{"text":"ship the model to the memory of the GPU","start":2611.18,"duration":5.25},{"text":"and then I remove the gradients you're","start":2613.97,"duration":3.96},{"text":"gonna figure out this next week what it","start":2616.43,"duration":5.369},{"text":"is I'm gonna bet get here my Y is gonna","start":2617.93,"duration":6.089},{"text":"be the output of the model to which I","start":2621.799,"duration":5.28},{"text":"input the X then I generate my figure","start":2624.019,"duration":5.611},{"text":"and I plot this stuff so this is to show","start":2627.079,"duration":5.91},{"text":"you that you can also get a

right I mean you can see","start":2636.819,"duration":5.95},{"text":"you can multiply data by matrix matrices","start":2640.039,"duration":5.611},{"text":"by using the PI torch package and so we","start":2642.769,"duration":5.461},{"text":"had to create a model sequential","start":2645.65,"duration":4.409},{"text":"container we put inside the

why","start":2651.92,"duration":5.129},{"text":"did I remove the translation because","start":2654.92,"duration":4.409},{"text":"otherwise I had to fetch it and it goes","start":2657.049,"duration":3.99},{"text":"outside the screen so I keep it in the","start":2659.329,"duration":7.141},{"text":"center okay all right so let's have this","start":2661.039,"duration":7.83},{"text":"one so right now I'm gonna just use the","start":2666.47,"duration":5.43},{"text":"following I just use a matrix that is I","start":2668.869,"duration":5.761},{"text":"think I didn't pick curl no it's gonna","start":2671.9,"duration":6.27},{"text":"be identity matrix which I scale both","start":2674.63,"duration":5.76},{"text":"items in the diagonal by the same item","start":2678.17,"duration":5.099},{"text":"by the same value and then I apply a","start":2680.39,"duration":4.8},{"text":"nonlinear function so my nonlinear","start":2683.269,"duration":3.691},{"text":"function is gonna be the following it's","start":2685.19,"duration":6.27},{"text":"a hyperbolic tangent which goes to minus","start":2686.96,"duration":7.77},{"text":"1 roughly when you cross the minus 2.5","start":2691.46,"duration":6.26},{"text":"here at the bottom and it goes to to put","start":2694.73,"duration":7.34},{"text":"goes to one roughly whenever you cross","start":2697.72,"duration":8.34},{"text":"the plus 2.5 okay up here so this stuff","start":2702.07,"duration":10.23},{"text":"Maps what the whole real line to wear

the","start":2715.9,"duration":6.36},{"text":"linear region which is roughly minus two","start":2719.05,"duration":5.7},{"text":"point five to two point five why do I","start":2722.26,"duration":3.87},{"text":"mention this name in these numbers","start":2724.75,"duration":2.88},{"text":"because sometimes you're gonna put your","start":2726.13,"duration":4.11},{"text":"nose inside your model it is not","start":2727.63,"duration":4.59},{"text":"training and you still want to figure","start":2730.24,"duration":4.59},{"text":"out the order of magnitude and you know","start":2732.22,"duration":4.83},{"text":"the rough the number which are kind of","start":2734.83,"duration":3.81},{"text":"associated to the kink of these","start":2737.05,"duration":4.95},{"text":"nonlinearities anyhow so I just create","start":2738.64,"duration":6.27},{"text":"this one which is very very similar to","start":2742.0,"duration":6.75},{"text":"the thing I just show you before which","start":2744.91,"duration":8.28},{"text":"has where is it here so here I have my","start":2748.75,"duration":6.26},{"text":"sequential which is the sequence of","start":2753.19,"duration":5.159},{"text":"operations I use a matrix first so this","start":2755.01,"duration":5.38},{"text":"linear to two then I applied the tonnage","start":2758.349,"duration":5.131},{"text":"and then I increased the I think the","start":2760.39,"duration":6.36},{"text":"multiplier for that diagonal matrix so","start":2763.48,"duration":5.31},{"text":"that's what you get so this is my cloud","start":2766.75,"duration":6.51},{"text":"what do you expect to see of my cloud so","start":2768.79,"duration":7.829},{"text":"what is the range of this cloud we said","start":2773.26,"duration":7.05},{"text":"it's roughly it goes from minus 3 to","start":2776.619,"duration":8.72},{"text":"plus 3 right where is the kink happening","start":2780.31,"duration":5.029},{"text":"so everything that is outside these two","start":2785.49,"duration":6.609},{"text":"point five minus two point five two plus","start":2789.73,"duration":5.91},{"text":"two point five box is going to be mapped","start":2792.099,"duration":8.971},{"text":"to one things that are inside stay","start":2795.64,"duration":8.58},{"text":"roughly the same that's correct so what","start":2801.07,"duration":5.279},{"text":"do you expect to see after this image","start":2804.22,"duration":8.44},{"text":"over here you expect","start":2806.349,"duration":9.701},{"text":"to have inbox your data but what is","start":2812.66,"duration":10.05},{"text":"going to be the size of this box are you","start":2816.05,"duration":7.58},{"text":"sure","start":2822.71,"duration":4.38},{"text":"so the the suggestion was from minus two","start":2823.63,"duration":6.21},{"text":"point five to two point five","start":2827.09,"duration":5.31},{"text":"the box is going to be 2 minus 1 2 plus","start":2829.84,"duration":6.1},{"text":"1 so minus 1 minus 1 I mean all the box","start":2832.4,"duration":4.89},{"text":"from minus 1 to plus 1","start":2835.94,"duration":3.33},{"text":"but then the points inside are going to","start":2837.29,"duration":3.84},{"text":"be

five","start":2842.9,"duration":4.44},{"text":"are getting linearly squeezed and then","start":2844.43,"duration":5.94},{"text":"things outside at two point five number","start":2847.34,"duration":4.91},{"text":"are going to be squashed down to the","start":2850.37,"duration":4.83},{"text":"basically edge of this box okay are

just two people","start":2858.41,"duration":6.27},{"text":"just said that I mean are we excited","start":2862.64,"duration":6.78},{"text":"come on give me some satisfaction okay","start":2864.68,"duration":6.09},{"text":"you're not playing with me","start":2869.42,"duration":5.01},{"text":"okay I see I'm trying to be nice to

oh","start":3037.48,"duration":7.619},{"text":"this is all right this is very spiky so","start":3042.339,"duration":4.26},{"text":"you're gonna figure out in the

neural","start":129.59,"duration":4.15},{"text":"network with the input on the bottom","start":132.15,"duration":3.12},{"text":"then we had like an affine","start":133.74,"duration":3.06},{"text":"transformation then we have a hidden","start":135.27,"duration":3.24},{"text":"layer right so I'm gonna just write the","start":136.8,"duration":3.96},{"text":"first equation we're gonna have that my","start":138.51,"duration":4.77},{"text":"hidden layer and since I'm writing

case","start":164.25,"duration":4.709},{"text":"I'm gonna be writing here Z is going to","start":166.23,"duration":8.759},{"text":"be equal to my matrix a times X okay we","start":168.959,"duration":8.221},{"text":"can imagine there is no bias in this","start":174.989,"duration":5.641},{"text":"case it's generic enough because we

B","start":183.09,"duration":10.619},{"text":"1 so if this X here belongs to RN and is","start":186.03,"duration":12.33},{"text":"dead here belongs to RM first question","start":193.709,"duration":9.06},{"text":"what is the size of this matrix okay","start":198.36,"duration":6.629},{"text":"fantastic right so this matrix here is","start":202.769,"duration":5.041},{"text":"gonna be our M times n you have as many","start":204.989,"duration":5.371},{"text":"rows as the dimension where you should -","start":207.81,"duration":4.5},{"text":"and you have as many columns the","start":210.36,"duration":3.84},{"text":"dimension where you're shooting from ok","start":212.31,"duration":5.16},{"text":"all right so let's expand this one right","start":214.2,"duration":5.73},{"text":"so this matrix here is gonna be equal to","start":217.47,"duration":7.17},{"text":"what do you have a 1 1 a 1 2 so on until","start":219.93,"duration":9.619},{"text":"the last one which is gonna be shout","start":224.64,"duration":8.209},{"text":"thank you 1","start":229.549,"duration":6.72},{"text":"and yeah 1n then you have second one's","start":232.849,"duration":8.821},{"text":"gonna have 1 a 2 1 a 2 2 so on until the","start":236.269,"duration":7.98},{"text":"last one which is 2 n right and then you","start":241.67,"duration":4.59},{"text":"keep going down until the last one which","start":244.249,"duration":10.591},{"text":"is going to be what are the indexes M 1","start":246.26,"duration":14.069},{"text":"right okay so you had a and 1 a M 2 and","start":254.84,"duration":9.9},{"text":"so on until amen okay thank you all","start":260.329,"duration":10.411},{"text":"right and then we have here our X right","start":264.74,"duration":12.48},{"text":"so you have X 1 X 2 and so on until xn","start":270.74,"duration":8.75},{"text":"right","start":277.22,"duration":2.27},{"text":"you're more responsive than last year","start":281.68,"duration":5.799},{"text":"good thank you alright so we can also","start":284.09,"duration":6.329},{"text":"rewrite this one in different ways so","start":287.479,"duration":4.62},{"text":"the first way I'm gonna write this one","start":290.419,"duration":4.861},{"text":"is gonna be the following so I'm gonna","start":292.099,"duration":7.921},{"text":"have here these a 1 then I'm gonna have","start":295.28,"duration":9.54},{"text":"here my a 2 and then I have the last one","start":300.02,"duration":12.389},{"text":"which is gonna be my a and ok and then","start":304.82,"duration":8.969},{"text":"here I'm gonna be multiplying this by a","start":312.409,"duration":3.391},{"text":"column vector right so my column vector","start":313.789,"duration":5.19},{"text":"I'm gonna be write it like this alright","start":315.8,"duration":7.609},{"text":"so what is the output of this operation","start":318.979,"duration":6.72},{"text":"so these are metrics you have a vector","start":323.409,"duration":5.411},{"text":"the outcome is going to be a vector so","start":325.699,"duration":4.801},{"text":"what is gonna be the first item of my","start":328.82,"duration":6.96},{"text":"vector I don't use dots because I'm not","start":330.5,"duration":7.05},{"text":"a physicist actually I am that we are","start":335.78,"duration":4.439},{"text":"doing linear algebra so what should I","start":337.55,"duration":4.85},{"text":"write","start":340.219,"duration":2.181},{"text":"alright so that's already transpose","start":343.81,"duration":3.699},{"text":"because those are a row vector so I just","start":345.889,"duration":3.78},{"text":"write a I'm gonna just mean just right","start":347.509,"duration":7.47},{"text":"right so I have a 1 X ok so there is no","start":349.669,"duration":7.981},{"text":"transposition here no dots around and so","start":354.979,"duration":7.801},{"text":"on second element is gonna be a two okay","start":357.65,"duration":7.77},{"text":"X and then until the last one which is","start":362.78,"duration":10.19},{"text":"gonna be D okay there's no dot but sure","start":365.42,"duration":10.32},{"text":"like someone is calling that dot product","start":372.97,"duration":4.84},{"text":"instead of the cross product but that is","start":375.74,"duration":3.929},{"text":"assumes like you use a different kind of","start":377.81,"duration":2.579},{"text":"notation","start":379.669,"duration":4.261},{"text":"all right so and this is gonna be my so","start":380.389,"duration":6.321},{"text":"how many elements does this vector have","start":383.93,"duration":7.17},{"text":"M okay so we have Z 1 Z 2 and so on","start":386.71,"duration":8.41},{"text":"until Z M and this is my final set right","start":391.1,"duration":7.319},{"text":"my vector is that okay fantastic so now","start":395.12,"duration":4.59},{"text":"we are going to be focusing a little bit","start":398.419,"duration":6.991},{"text":"about the meaning of this thing over","start":399.71,"duration":8.88},{"text":"here okay other questions so far","start":405.41,"duration":5.64},{"text":"all right this is very trivial so far I","start":408.59,"duration":5.94},{"text":"hope I mean let me know if if not okay","start":411.05,"duration":6.21},{"text":"okay so let's analyze one of these guys","start":414.53,"duration":5.61},{"text":"here so I'd like to figure out what is","start":417.26,"duration":8.969},{"text":"the meaning of writing a T times X right","start":420.14,"duration":10.83},{"text":"so my a T is gonna be my generic a I so","start":426.229,"duration":10.381},{"text":"let's assume in this case when n equal","start":430.97,"duration":13.71},{"text":"to okay so what is ATX so ATX is going","start":436.61,"duration":10.98},{"text":"to be equal to what so let me draw here","start":444.68,"duration":5.1},{"text":"something so that is gonna be easier for","start":447.59,"duration":4.11},{"text":"you to understand so this one is gonna","start":449.78,"duration":7.94},{"text":"be my a are these gonna be my alpha and","start":451.7,"duration":9.6},{"text":"then here you have like it's gonna be my","start":457.72,"duration":10.9},{"text":"X and is this gonna be here my X I so","start":461.3,"duration":9.78},{"text":"what is this what is the output of this","start":468.62,"duration":8.81},{"text":"product here these are here","start":471.08,"duration":6.35},{"text":"see you can sorry 8\/8 transpose it let's","start":478.21,"duration":10.26},{"text":"call it let's say that is a row vector","start":484.79,"duration":3.68},{"text":"can you see know what is gonna be the","start":490.03,"duration":17.85},{"text":"output of this operation here no why","start":496.73,"duration":11.15},{"text":"this is this is like a generic one of","start":509.41,"duration":5.2},{"text":"the many aids right there are M aids","start":512.51,"duration":4.8},{"text":"this is one of those mas so I'm","start":514.61,"duration":4.559},{"text":"multiplying one of those A's times my X","start":517.31,"duration":4.5},{"text":"right let's assume there are only two","start":519.169,"duration":4.141},{"text":"dimensions so what is gonna be the","start":521.81,"duration":4.29},{"text":"output of this scalar product can","start":523.31,"duration":7.35},{"text":"someone tell me no no no like normal","start":526.1,"duration":13.86},{"text":"scalar product hold on","start":530.66,"duration":12.06},{"text":"so you have egg hey here do you have","start":539.96,"duration":5.97},{"text":"here this part here is gonna be a 1 it","start":542.72,"duration":5.79},{"text":"is gonna be a two okay then you have","start":545.93,"duration":8.49},{"text":"here x1 and now you have x2 right so how","start":548.51,"duration":10.04},{"text":"do you express this scalar product here","start":554.42,"duration":4.13},{"text":"okay so I'm just writing let me know if","start":559.98,"duration":6.75},{"text":"you took clear so I'm gonna write here a","start":562.18,"duration":4.55},{"text":"1 times X 1 plus a 2 times X 2 right","start":568.89,"duration":8.89},{"text":"this is the definition clear right so","start":574.39,"duration":8.79},{"text":"far yeah no okay yeah question yeah that","start":577.78,"duration":7.05},{"text":"is meant to be a transpose Y a role","start":583.18,"duration":4.38},{"text":"times column vector so let's assume a is","start":584.83,"duration":4.77},{"text":"a column vector then I have role x","start":587.56,"duration":5.16},{"text":"colouring so let's keep writing this","start":589.6,"duration":12.63},{"text":"stuff here so what is a 1 how can i","start":592.72,"duration":20.19},{"text":"compute AI a 1 second ok ok","start":602.23,"duration":12.99},{"text":"so I'm gonna write here the a 1 is going","start":612.91,"duration":4.68},{"text":"to be the length of vector a times","start":615.22,"duration":5.55},{"text":"cosine alpha then what about X 1 someone","start":617.59,"duration":8.1},{"text":"else the same right now wait what what","start":620.77,"duration":9.24},{"text":"is X 1 same thing right different","start":625.69,"duration":9.75},{"text":"letters so someone say something you're","start":630.01,"duration":7.44},{"text":"following you're completely confused","start":635.44,"duration":4.83},{"text":"you're not having any idea it's too easy","start":637.45,"duration":5.76},{"text":"I have no idea what's going on here it's","start":640.27,"duration":4.62},{"text":"good right so far ok what's gonna be the","start":643.21,"duration":10.56},{"text":"second term the this one is gonna be X","start":644.89,"duration":14.13},{"text":"here write x cos x I right and then you","start":653.77,"duration":6.66},{"text":"had the second term which is going to be","start":659.02,"duration":9.71},{"text":"what magnitude of a shout I can hear ok","start":660.43,"duration":13.49},{"text":"sine of alpha and then","start":668.73,"duration":5.19},{"text":"okay thank you okay","start":677.66,"duration":3.63},{"text":"all right I'm gonna be just putting","start":683.93,"duration":3.94},{"text":"together those two guys so you're gonna","start":686.31,"duration":5.31},{"text":"get equal magnitude of a times magnitude","start":687.87,"duration":12.5},{"text":"of x times cosine alpha cosine Phi plus","start":691.62,"duration":15.09},{"text":"sana sine alpha and sine cosine a sine X","start":700.37,"duration":7.84},{"text":"I sorry","start":706.71,"duration":6.45},{"text":"what is be starting the parentheses all","start":708.21,"duration":6.0},{"text":"right so there's the cosine of the","start":713.16,"duration":2.16},{"text":"difference of the two angle right","start":714.21,"duration":3.03},{"text":"everyone knows trigonometry here right","start":715.32,"duration":4.74},{"text":"sorry high school stuff so this one is","start":717.24,"duration":7.92},{"text":"gonna be equal to a x times the cosine","start":720.06,"duration":9.39},{"text":"of cos x i minus alpha right oh the","start":725.16,"duration":5.84},{"text":"other way around right from monoxides","start":729.45,"duration":4.8},{"text":"so what does this mean you can think","start":731.0,"duration":6.04},{"text":"about each element so far is clear I I","start":734.25,"duration":5.52},{"text":"didn't do any magic yeah shake your head","start":737.04,"duration":5.64},{"text":"like these four yes these four no this","start":739.77,"duration":6.42},{"text":"for maybe no something's working okay so","start":742.68,"duration":5.13},{"text":"you can think about whenever you","start":746.19,"duration":4.56},{"text":"multiply a matrix times a vector that","start":747.81,"duration":5.79},{"text":"basically each output of this operation","start":750.75,"duration":6.72},{"text":"is gonna be measuring so okay hold on","start":753.6,"duration":5.97},{"text":"what is this cosine how much is cosine","start":757.47,"duration":5.85},{"text":"of zero one so it means if these two","start":759.57,"duration":6.21},{"text":"angles if the two vectors are aligned","start":763.32,"duration":4.47},{"text":"which means there is a zero angle","start":765.78,"duration":4.68},{"text":"between the two vectors you can have the","start":767.79,"duration":5.73},{"text":"maximum value of this element right","start":770.46,"duration":6.63},{"text":"whenever when you have the minus the","start":773.52,"duration":8.03},{"text":"most negative value when they are","start":777.09,"duration":6.15},{"text":"opposite right so when they're in","start":781.55,"duration":3.31},{"text":"opposition of phase you're gonna get the","start":783.24,"duration":5.07},{"text":"most negative magnitude but then if you","start":784.86,"duration":5.52},{"text":"apply just let's a redo you're gonna cut","start":788.31,"duration":3.42},{"text":"all those negative things you're just","start":790.38,"duration":3.33},{"text":"checking for the positive matches right","start":791.73,"duration":4.47},{"text":"so neural net basically just perhaps","start":793.71,"duration":4.53},{"text":"who's gonna be figuring out only the","start":796.2,"duration":4.32},{"text":"positive matches right and so again when","start":798.24,"duration":3.66},{"text":"you multiply a matrix times a column","start":800.52,"duration":3.1},{"text":"vector you","start":801.9,"duration":5.439},{"text":"be performing element-wise sorry scalar","start":803.62,"duration":7.71},{"text":"product between each column each row of","start":807.339,"duration":6.871},{"text":"the matrix which represents your kernel","start":811.33,"duration":4.89},{"text":"right so whenever you have like a linear","start":814.21,"duration":3.6},{"text":"layer your kernel is gonna be the whole","start":816.22,"duration":3.78},{"text":"row of the matrix and now you see what","start":817.81,"duration":5.55},{"text":"is the projection of that input on that","start":820.0,"duration":7.05},{"text":"column I am on the input on that flow","start":823.36,"duration":6.75},{"text":"right so each element of this product is","start":827.05,"duration":5.85},{"text":"going to tell you the alignment with","start":830.11,"duration":5.55},{"text":"which the input is what is the alignment","start":832.9,"duration":4.68},{"text":"of the input with respect to the","start":835.66,"duration":4.41},{"text":"specific row of the matrix okay","start":837.58,"duration":7.02},{"text":"yes no this should shape some more like","start":840.07,"duration":6.019},{"text":"intuition while we are using these","start":844.6,"duration":3.69},{"text":"linear transformations they are like","start":846.089,"duration":4.781},{"text":"allowing you to see the projection of","start":848.29,"duration":4.85},{"text":"the input onto different kind of","start":850.87,"duration":9.27},{"text":"orientations let's say this way okay you","start":853.14,"duration":9.16},{"text":"can try to you know extrapolate this in","start":860.14,"duration":4.199},{"text":"high dimensions I guess the intuition at","start":862.3,"duration":3.84},{"text":"least I can give it to you works","start":864.339,"duration":3.351},{"text":"definitely in two and three dimensions","start":866.14,"duration":4.44},{"text":"in higher dimensions I kind of think it","start":867.69,"duration":5.26},{"text":"works in a similar way next lesson we","start":870.58,"duration":3.629},{"text":"are going to watch we are actually we","start":872.95,"duration":3.509},{"text":"are going to see how what is the","start":874.209,"duration":4.681},{"text":"distribution of the projections in a","start":876.459,"duration":4.561},{"text":"higher dimensional space is this sort","start":878.89,"duration":4.35},{"text":"gonna be so cool I think all right so","start":881.02,"duration":4.23},{"text":"this was the first part of I think of","start":883.24,"duration":6.539},{"text":"the class oh well there is one more more","start":885.25,"duration":8.31},{"text":"part so actually here this said here we","start":889.779,"duration":5.161},{"text":"can also write it in a different way so","start":893.56,"duration":3.96},{"text":"maybe this is maybe it's known maybe","start":894.94,"duration":5.19},{"text":"it's not known when I saw it first time","start":897.52,"duration":5.009},{"text":"I didn't know so you know it's it's cool","start":900.13,"duration":4.92},{"text":"that sometimes you see these things once","start":902.529,"duration":5.701},{"text":"again maybe so let's go back here is the","start":905.05,"duration":5.4},{"text":"things that there and so you can express","start":908.23,"duration":8.19},{"text":"this Z as being equal the vector a 1 in","start":910.45,"duration":8.37},{"text":"this case a 1 is gonna be the first","start":916.42,"duration":5.1},{"text":"column of the a matrix ok and this one","start":918.82,"duration":4.01},{"text":"is going to be multiplied by the scalar","start":921.52,"duration":4.35},{"text":"x1 now you have the second column of the","start":922.83,"duration":6.55},{"text":"matrix so I have a 2 this is multiplied","start":925.87,"duration":5.159},{"text":"by the second element of the X right","start":929.38,"duration":5.49},{"text":"until the last one which is gonna be","start":931.029,"duration":10.601},{"text":"again I can't hear if it's M or n m like","start":934.87,"duration":10.06},{"text":"this or end you know sign language which","start":941.63,"duration":7.71},{"text":"one n right you know sign language no","start":944.93,"duration":7.95},{"text":"you should learn it's good you know","start":949.34,"duration":6.9},{"text":"inclusivity a and write the last column","start":952.88,"duration":6.75},{"text":"times your X and of course because n X","start":956.24,"duration":5.67},{"text":"has a size of n there are n items right","start":959.63,"duration":4.47},{"text":"and so basically when you also when you","start":961.91,"duration":4.23},{"text":"do a you know transformation a linear","start":964.1,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you know apply a linear operator you","start":966.14,"duration":3.84},{"text":"can't be basically waiting each column","start":967.94,"duration":4.95},{"text":"of the matrix with the coefficient that","start":969.98,"duration":5.19},{"text":"is in a you know you have first column","start":972.89,"duration":3.75},{"text":"times the first coefficient of the","start":975.17,"duration":3.93},{"text":"vector second column and by the second","start":976.64,"duration":5.49},{"text":"item plus third column times the third","start":979.1,"duration":4.89},{"text":"item and so you can see the output of","start":982.13,"duration":4.29},{"text":"this DN transformation is a weighted sum","start":983.99,"duration":6.84},{"text":"of the columns of the a matrix okay so","start":986.42,"duration":5.76},{"text":"this is a different kind of intuition","start":990.83,"duration":3.81},{"text":"sometimes you see these as like whenever","start":992.18,"duration":4.44},{"text":"you want to express your signal your","start":994.64,"duration":7.11},{"text":"data is a combination of different you","start":996.62,"duration":8.67},{"text":"know the composition this is kind of a","start":1001.75,"duration":6.3},{"text":"linear composition of your input alright","start":1005.29,"duration":5.31},{"text":"so that was the first part it is the","start":1008.05,"duration":5.85},{"text":"recap about the linear algebra a second","start":1010.6,"duration":6.93},{"text":"part is going to be something even more","start":1013.9,"duration":5.93},{"text":"cool I think questions so far","start":1017.53,"duration":9.26},{"text":"no easy too easy you're getting bored","start":1019.83,"duration":9.97},{"text":"sorry okay all right then I'm gonna","start":1026.79,"duration":3.88},{"text":"speed up I guess","start":1029.8,"duration":3.539},{"text":"alright so let's see how we can extend","start":1030.67,"duration":4.5},{"text":"the one that the stuff we have seen","start":1033.339,"duration":4.291},{"text":"right now to convolutions right so maybe","start":1035.17,"duration":3.87},{"text":"convolution sometimes are a little bit","start":1037.63,"duration":3.69},{"text":"weird let's see how we can do an","start":1039.04,"duration":9.86},{"text":"extension to convolutions","start":1041.32,"duration":7.58},{"text":"all right so let's say I start with the","start":1051.72,"duration":6.67},{"text":"same matrix so I'm gonna have here four","start":1054.94,"duration":11.19},{"text":"rows and then three columns okay so my","start":1058.39,"duration":15.27},{"text":"data has to be if I had if I had this","start":1066.13,"duration":10.44},{"text":"matrix if I multiply this to a column my","start":1073.66,"duration":5.7},{"text":"column vector should be of size three","start":1076.57,"duration":5.609},{"text":"thank you all right so let me draw here","start":1079.36,"duration":4.89},{"text":"my column vector of size right and this","start":1082.179,"duration":5.671},{"text":"is gonna give you a output of size four","start":1084.25,"duration":4.559},{"text":"okay fantastic","start":1087.85,"duration":3.66},{"text":"but then is your data let's say you're","start":1088.809,"duration":6.931},{"text":"gonna listen to some nice audio audio","start":1091.51,"duration":6.75},{"text":"file is your data just three simple long","start":1095.74,"duration":5.52},{"text":"how long is gonna be your data let's say","start":1098.26,"duration":5.28},{"text":"you listening to a piece of music that","start":1101.26,"duration":3.33},{"text":"is like three minutes","start":1103.54,"duration":3.54},{"text":"how many sample does three minutes of","start":1104.59,"duration":7.74},{"text":"all your health yeah I guess what is","start":1107.08,"duration":9.479},{"text":"gonna be my sampling rate let's say","start":1112.33,"duration":7.74},{"text":"twenty two okay twenty two thousand kilo","start":1116.559,"duration":6.24},{"text":"Hertz right 22 kilohertz so how many","start":1120.07,"duration":6.41},{"text":"samples three minutes of music have","start":1122.799,"duration":3.681},{"text":"second you sure is monophonic","start":1127.799,"duration":10.211},{"text":"or stereophonic just kidding okay so","start":1135.28,"duration":4.29},{"text":"you're gonna multiply the number of","start":1138.01,"duration":4.64},{"text":"sample the number of seconds right","start":1139.57,"duration":6.84},{"text":"number of seconds times the frame rate","start":1142.65,"duration":6.01},{"text":"right the okay the frequency in this","start":1146.41,"duration":4.23},{"text":"case anyhow so this signal is gonna be","start":1148.66,"duration":3.96},{"text":"very very long right it's gonna be keep","start":1150.64,"duration":4.59},{"text":"going down so if I have a vector that is","start":1152.62,"duration":4.32},{"text":"very very long I have I have to use a","start":1155.23,"duration":5.79},{"text":"matrix which is gonna be very very fat","start":1156.94,"duration":6.6},{"text":"wide right okay fantastic so this top","start":1161.02,"duration":4.08},{"text":"keeps going this direction","start":1163.54,"duration":3.54},{"text":"alright so my question for you is gonna","start":1165.1,"duration":3.99},{"text":"be what should I put in this location","start":1167.08,"duration":4.46},{"text":"here","start":1169.09,"duration":2.45},{"text":"what should I put here so do we care","start":1175.57,"duration":12.45},{"text":"about things that are further away","start":1183.89,"duration":4.13},{"text":"no why not","start":1188.74,"duration":5.26},{"text":"because our data has the property of","start":1190.61,"duration":6.03},{"text":"locality fantastic so what am I gonna go","start":1194.0,"duration":6.299},{"text":"what am I gonna be putting here a big","start":1196.64,"duration":6.99},{"text":"zero right fantastic mom okay so we put","start":1200.299,"duration":6.391},{"text":"a zero here and then what is the other","start":1203.63,"duration":4.59},{"text":"property so let me start drawing this","start":1206.69,"duration":3.119},{"text":"stuff again right so can I have my","start":1208.22,"duration":5.64},{"text":"kernel of size three and then here I","start":1209.809,"duration":7.081},{"text":"have my data which is gonna be very long","start":1213.86,"duration":14.939},{"text":"right so hold on I can see all right so","start":1216.89,"duration":14.279},{"text":"here there are zero then let's say what","start":1228.799,"duration":5.01},{"text":"is the other property my my my date my","start":1231.169,"duration":5.791},{"text":"natural data have stationarity which","start":1233.809,"duration":9.36},{"text":"means the pattern that you expect to","start":1236.96,"duration":8.099},{"text":"find this can be kind of repeating over","start":1243.169,"duration":4.051},{"text":"and over again right and so if I have","start":1245.059,"duration":4.081},{"text":"here my three values here perhaps I'd","start":1247.22,"duration":4.14},{"text":"like to reuse them over and over again","start":1249.14,"duration":4.649},{"text":"right and so if these three values let","start":1251.36,"duration":4.949},{"text":"me change the color maybe so you can see","start":1253.789,"duration":6.99},{"text":"in there is the same stuff so I have","start":1256.309,"duration":7.771},{"text":"three values here and then I'm gonna be","start":1260.779,"duration":6.451},{"text":"using these three same values one step","start":1264.08,"duration":6.15},{"text":"for the rain and I keep going further I","start":1267.23,"duration":9.54},{"text":"don't down and I keep going this way all","start":1270.23,"duration":8.13},{"text":"right so what should I put here on the","start":1276.77,"duration":6.029},{"text":"bottom what should I put here a zero","start":1278.36,"duration":7.25},{"text":"right why that why is that because of","start":1282.799,"duration":5.73},{"text":"locality of the data right so putting","start":1285.61,"duration":9.039},{"text":"zeros around is called it's also called","start":1288.529,"duration":7.821},{"text":"padding but in this case it's called","start":1294.649,"duration":5.63},{"text":"sparsity right so this is like sparsity","start":1296.35,"duration":8.5},{"text":"and then the replication of this thing","start":1300.279,"duration":6.781},{"text":"that is over and over over again","start":1304.85,"duration":7.88},{"text":"it's called session I'd was the property","start":1307.06,"duration":7.8},{"text":"of the signal this is called weight","start":1312.73,"duration":4.7},{"text":"sharing yeah","start":1314.86,"duration":2.57},{"text":"okay fantastic all right so how many how","start":1324.33,"duration":5.76},{"text":"many values do we have now how many","start":1328.8,"duration":4.73},{"text":"parameters I have on the right hand side","start":1330.09,"duration":3.44},{"text":"well so we have three parameters over","start":1335.15,"duration":7.6},{"text":"left on the left hand side instead we","start":1341.1,"duration":6.0},{"text":"had product right so if the right side","start":1342.75,"duration":6.15},{"text":"is gonna be easy is the right side gonna","start":1347.1,"duration":7.47},{"text":"work at whole you have three parameters","start":1348.9,"duration":7.91},{"text":"one side on the other side you have 12","start":1354.57,"duration":5.19},{"text":"okay that is good using locality and","start":1356.81,"duration":5.05},{"text":"spiral and whatever not like sparsity","start":1359.76,"duration":4.05},{"text":"and parameter sharing but then now we","start":1361.86,"duration":3.75},{"text":"end up with just three parameters isn't","start":1363.81,"duration":4.5},{"text":"this too restrictive how can we have","start":1365.61,"duration":5.58},{"text":"multiple multiple parameter what's","start":1368.31,"duration":6.21},{"text":"missing here in the big picture there","start":1371.19,"duration":5.1},{"text":"are multiple channels right so this is","start":1374.52,"duration":4.92},{"text":"just one layer here and then you have","start":1376.29,"duration":5.28},{"text":"this stuff coming out from the from the","start":1379.44,"duration":3.99},{"text":"from the board here so you have the","start":1381.57,"duration":6.66},{"text":"first kernel down here now he has some","start":1383.43,"duration":11.19},{"text":"second kernel let's say listen and I","start":1388.23,"duration":12.27},{"text":"have last one here right and so you have","start":1394.62,"duration":8.49},{"text":"each plane of these metrics being","start":1400.5,"duration":4.26},{"text":"containing just one kernel which is","start":1403.11,"duration":4.86},{"text":"replicated multiple times who knows the","start":1404.76,"duration":11.43},{"text":"name of this matrix now so this is gonna","start":1407.97,"duration":12.68},{"text":"be called triplets top list matrix","start":1416.19,"duration":4.46},{"text":"okay so what is the main feature of","start":1423.419,"duration":4.8},{"text":"these topless metrics what is the big","start":1426.089,"duration":7.56},{"text":"big big thing that you won't notice it's","start":1428.219,"duration":13.26},{"text":"a sparse matrix okay okay what is gonna","start":1433.649,"duration":11.551},{"text":"be here this first item over here what","start":1441.479,"duration":14.67},{"text":"is the content of the first guy yeah so","start":1445.2,"duration":13.139},{"text":"this one here is gonna be the extension","start":1456.149,"duration":5.52},{"text":"of my linear transformation which was","start":1458.339,"duration":5.52},{"text":"you know I have a signal that is longer","start":1461.669,"duration":4.5},{"text":"than three samples therefore I have to","start":1463.859,"duration":5.37},{"text":"make this matrix fatter second part is","start":1466.169,"duration":6.06},{"text":"might be given that I don't care about","start":1469.229,"duration":5.25},{"text":"what things like things that are here","start":1472.229,"duration":3.9},{"text":"down I don't care about things that are","start":1474.479,"duration":3.51},{"text":"here if I look at the points that are up","start":1476.129,"duration":4.17},{"text":"here so gonna be putting a big 0 here","start":1477.989,"duration":4.32},{"text":"such that Oh everything that is down","start":1480.299,"duration":4.771},{"text":"here it gets cleaned up right and then","start":1482.309,"duration":4.44},{"text":"finally I'm gonna be using the same","start":1485.07,"duration":4.829},{"text":"kernel over and over again because I","start":1486.749,"duration":6.571},{"text":"assume that my data is stationary and","start":1489.899,"duration":5.94},{"text":"therefore I assume that similar patterns","start":1493.32,"duration":4.079},{"text":"are gonna be happening over and over","start":1495.839,"duration":3.09},{"text":"again therefore I'm gonna be using this","start":1497.399,"duration":3.421},{"text":"one which is written here parameter","start":1498.929,"duration":4.5},{"text":"sharing weight sharing","start":1500.82,"duration":5.009},{"text":"finally given that this one gives you","start":1503.429,"duration":4.59},{"text":"only three parameter two parameters to","start":1505.829,"duration":5.13},{"text":"work with I will use several layers in","start":1508.019,"duration":4.921},{"text":"order to have different you know","start":1510.959,"duration":4.44},{"text":"channels so this one is one kernel","start":1512.94,"duration":4.799},{"text":"before one kernel was the whole row of","start":1515.399,"duration":4.62},{"text":"the matrix okay so when you have a fully","start":1517.739,"duration":4.11},{"text":"connected layer the only difference","start":1520.019,"duration":3.301},{"text":"between a fully connected layer and a","start":1521.849,"duration":3.33},{"text":"convolution is that you have the full","start":1523.32,"duration":7.709},{"text":"dam row of the matrix so what is gonna","start":1525.179,"duration":11.84},{"text":"be in this first item over here anyone","start":1531.029,"duration":5.99},{"text":"so the green colonel let's call the","start":1538.48,"duration":4.75},{"text":"green corner just a one let me actually","start":1540.77,"duration":4.409},{"text":"make it glow green because it's green","start":1543.23,"duration":11.97},{"text":"karna so you have a one times what it's","start":1545.179,"duration":11.461},{"text":"gonna be from the number one to number","start":1555.2,"duration":3.69},{"text":"three right and then the second item is","start":1556.64,"duration":6.12},{"text":"gonna be same same dude here a 1 and","start":1558.89,"duration":6.75},{"text":"then you're gonna have the X shifted by","start":1562.76,"duration":15.659},{"text":"one and so on right make sense yeah and","start":1565.64,"duration":14.399},{"text":"then we're gonna have this one is going","start":1578.419,"duration":2.851},{"text":"to be the green output then you're gonna","start":1580.039,"duration":3.931},{"text":"have the blue output one layer coming","start":1581.27,"duration":4.17},{"text":"out and then you have the further one","start":1583.97,"duration":2.76},{"text":"the red one coming","start":1585.44,"duration":5.219},{"text":"we've been one layer out okay what's the","start":1586.73,"duration":6.199},{"text":"iPad experience cool","start":1590.659,"duration":9.861},{"text":"yes no I liked it okay other questions","start":1592.929,"duration":7.591},{"text":"so again the blue circle this one it's a","start":1601.029,"duration":8.02},{"text":"big zero","start":1608.419,"duration":5.061},{"text":"that's the sparsity one the same is here","start":1609.049,"duration":4.431},{"text":"yes no yeah yeah","start":1613.899,"duration":4.621},{"text":"yeah green so here I just put a lot of","start":1621.53,"duration":14.67},{"text":"zeros inside here so I killed all the","start":1634.01,"duration":4.29},{"text":"values that are away from the little","start":1636.2,"duration":4.8},{"text":"part and then I repeat the same

said","start":1647.45,"duration":7.29},{"text":"that in this case I'm gonna have just","start":1653.36,"duration":3.48},{"text":"three values right and we started with","start":1654.74,"duration":4.14},{"text":"12 values and I ended up with 3 which is","start":1656.84,"duration":4.2},{"text":"really really little so if I'd like to","start":1658.88,"duration":4.44},{"text":"have let's say 6 values then if I want","start":1661.04,"duration":3.72},{"text":"to have six values and I can have

zeros","start":1677.29,"duration":10.15},{"text":"that's it yeah so they're gonna have","start":1678.77,"duration":10.83},{"text":"this one here then you have a second one","start":1687.44,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you have a third one so you have three","start":1689.6,"duration":5.19},{"text":"versions of the input alright so for a","start":1691.28,"duration":4.86},{"text":"second part of the class I'm gonna be","start":1694.79,"duration":3.21},{"text":"showing you some more interactive

the","start":1786.66,"duration":5.54},{"text":"top here","start":1789.69,"duration":2.51},{"text":"alright so given the assumption of","start":1792.89,"duration":4.06},{"text":"locality stationarity

that","start":1832.59,"duration":4.589},{"text":"professor here at NYU made and here I'm","start":1834.27,"duration":5.61},{"text":"gonna be just loading my audio data and","start":1837.179,"duration":5.13},{"text":"I'm gonna have that in my X and then my","start":1839.88,"duration":3.72},{"text":"sampling grade is going to be","start":1842.309,"duration":3.691},{"text":"in the other variable so here I'll just","start":1843.6,"duration":4.97},{"text":"show you I'm gonna have like 70,000","start":1846.0,"duration":5.67},{"text":"samples in this case because I have a","start":1848.57,"duration":5.86},{"text":"simple in rate of 22 kilo Hertz and then","start":1851.67,"duration":5.91},{"text":"my total time is gonna be three seconds","start":1854.43,"duration":7.29},{"text":"okay so three seconds times 22 you get","start":1857.58,"duration":7.68},{"text":"what so it's not 180 you were saying it","start":1861.72,"duration":5.19},{"text":"was a hundred and eighty was three right","start":1865.26,"duration":4.41},{"text":"oh it was three minutes oh you're right","start":1866.91,"duration":4.47},{"text":"it's three seconds so you actually are","start":1869.67,"duration":4.05},{"text":"correct my dad so this is three seconds","start":1871.38,"duration":5.16},{"text":"so times 22 kilo Hertz you get 17","start":1873.72,"duration":7.26},{"text":"roughly some 70,000 samples here I'm","start":1876.54,"duration":5.85},{"text":"gonna be important some libraries to","start":1880.98,"duration":3.95},{"text":"show you something and then I'm gonna be","start":1882.39,"duration":5.79},{"text":"showing you the first chart so this is","start":1884.93,"duration":5.56},{"text":"the audio signal I have imported right","start":1888.18,"duration":9.09},{"text":"now how does it look like wavy okay cool","start":1890.49,"duration":15.03},{"text":"can you tell me how it sounds that was a","start":1897.27,"duration":13.41},{"text":"good guess the guess was you can tell is","start":1905.52,"duration":7.02},{"text":"actually what's the content right from","start":1910.68,"duration":4.77},{"text":"this diagram because the amplitude of","start":1912.54,"duration":6.6},{"text":"like the the the y-axis here is gonna be","start":1915.45,"duration":5.79},{"text":"showing you just the amplitude can I","start":1919.14,"duration":5.28},{"text":"turn off the light is okay or you're you","start":1921.24,"duration":4.29},{"text":"sure okay thank you","start":1924.42,"duration":6.84},{"text":"I really

anything","start":1936.09,"duration":3.84},{"text":"here right","start":1938.91,"duration":3.66},{"text":"you can't not tell what is the what is","start":1939.93,"duration":6.65},{"text":"the sound right so how can we figure out","start":1942.57,"duration":7.23},{"text":"what is the sound inside here so for","start":1946.58,"duration":5.29},{"text":"example I can show you a transcript over","start":1949.8,"duration":5.28},{"text":"the sound and actually let me let me","start":1951.87,"duration":5.79},{"text":"actually force these in your in your","start":1955.08,"duration":6.44},{"text":"your head right so you're gonna have","start":1957.66,"duration":7.15},{"text":"hold on your network","start":1961.52,"duration":6.81},{"text":"all right so now we actually heard it","start":1964.81,"duration":5.8},{"text":"okay so now you can actually see ting","start":1968.33,"duration":5.43},{"text":"ting ting boom you know you can kind of","start":1970.61,"duration":5.79},{"text":"imagine a little bit but okay so what","start":1973.76,"duration":5.07},{"text":"notes did we play there like how can I","start":1976.4,"duration":4.43},{"text":"figure out what put out the notes that","start":1978.83,"duration":4.44},{"text":"they are inside so I'm gonna be showing","start":1980.83,"duration":4.72},{"text":"this one so since this is a bit brighter","start":1983.27,"duration":4.74},{"text":"I can see your faces how many of you can","start":1985.55,"duration":8.27},{"text":"not read this oh ouch","start":1988.01,"duration":16.83},{"text":"okay so let me let me see if I can help","start":1993.82,"duration":42.31},{"text":"us out here okay the connection would","start":2004.84,"duration":37.65},{"text":"help please alright let me try to thank","start":2036.13,"duration":10.22},{"text":"you all right","start":2042.49,"duration":3.86},{"text":"how cool is that thank you it took four","start":2054.44,"duration":13.55},{"text":"lessons for you to clap nice oh now","start":2064.74,"duration":7.0},{"text":"this is very nice of you let's keep","start":2067.99,"duration":9.03},{"text":"going and you fly because between the","start":2071.74,"duration":9.71},{"text":"first a frequencies is that the first a","start":2077.02,"duration":7.53},{"text":"thin flap maybe twice the frequency as","start":2081.45,"duration":8.62},{"text":"the other figure out what is the","start":2084.55,"duration":7.289},{"text":"frequency of that and then we're gonna","start":2090.07,"duration":7.35},{"text":"be sine is that we have vehicle payment","start":2091.839,"duration":7.861},{"text":"and so we're gonna have a a flap in our","start":2097.42,"duration":4.97},{"text":"shop","start":2099.7,"duration":2.69},{"text":"so if we put all together we gonna get","start":2104.96,"duration":5.22},{"text":"season","start":2107.7,"duration":2.48},{"text":"all right simple no yep thank you","start":2111.2,"duration":7.619},{"text":"bye-bye okay","start":2113.849,"duration":7.74},{"text":"seeing this took a whole damn day to","start":2118.819,"duration":4.721},{"text":"prepare","start":2121.589,"duration":10.981},{"text":"I was so nervous before come here I'm so","start":2123.54,"duration":10.95},{"text":"happy now I can actually go to sleep","start":2132.57,"duration":2.43},{"text":"later","start":2134.49,"duration":4.8},{"text":"anyhow so this was like in the first","start":2135.0,"duration":6.27},{"text":"part you're gonna have the first note","start":2139.29,"duration":3.99},{"text":"there's a flap that you have a b-flat","start":2141.27,"duration":7.71},{"text":"a-flat and B so you have the and the","start":2143.28,"duration":8.27},{"text":"difference between the first pitch and","start":2148.98,"duration":5.55},{"text":"is one octave there for the first","start":2151.55,"duration":5.89},{"text":"frequency is gonna be twice the second","start":2154.53,"duration":5.07},{"text":"frequency okay so whenever we're gonna","start":2157.44,"duration":5.43},{"text":"be observing the waveform one sign will","start":2159.6,"duration":6.39},{"text":"have to a shorter like the half the","start":2162.87,"duration":4.86},{"text":"period of the other one right the","start":2165.99,"duration":4.14},{"text":"especially the the a the a flat on top","start":2167.73,"duration":4.68},{"text":"is gonna have a period which is half of","start":2170.13,"duration":5.19},{"text":"the period of the a on the bottom one","start":2172.41,"duration":7.59},{"text":"right so you have okay if you go half of","start":2175.32,"duration":9.24},{"text":"this one you get right okay okay so how","start":2180.0,"duration":7.29},{"text":"do we actually get these notes out from","start":2184.56,"duration":5.57},{"text":"that spectra from the from the waveform","start":2187.29,"duration":6.48},{"text":"who can tell me how can I extract these","start":2190.13,"duration":6.13},{"text":"pitches these frequencies from the other","start":2193.77,"duration":7.02},{"text":"signal any guess okay a free transform","start":2196.26,"duration":6.27},{"text":"that I think if are kind of a good guess","start":2200.79,"duration":4.74},{"text":"what does it happen if I perform now a","start":2202.53,"duration":5.85},{"text":"Fourier transform of that signal anyone","start":2205.53,"duration":5.13},{"text":"can actually answer me you cannot raise","start":2208.38,"duration":5.72},{"text":"your hand because I don't see just shout","start":2210.66,"duration":3.44},{"text":"so if you basically perform the Fourier","start":2215.12,"duration":4.57},{"text":"transform of the whole scene are you","start":2218.43,"duration":4.91},{"text":"gonna hear like the whole notes together","start":2219.69,"duration":6.78},{"text":"all together right but then you can't","start":2223.34,"duration":5.26},{"text":"figure out which pitch is playing where","start":2226.47,"duration":6.79},{"text":"or when actually in this case right","start":2228.6,"duration":7.06},{"text":"ha so we need kind of a Fourier","start":2233.26,"duration":4.95},{"text":"transform which is localized and so a","start":2235.66,"duration":5.1},{"text":"localized Fourier transform in time or","start":2238.21,"duration":4.98},{"text":"in space depending on whatever domain","start":2240.76,"duration":4.83},{"text":"you are using its called spectrograph","start":2243.19,"duration":4.2},{"text":"right and so on I'm gonna be now","start":2245.59,"duration":3.39},{"text":"printing for you the spectrogram oh","start":2247.39,"duration":2.61},{"text":"sorry","start":2248.98,"duration":2.91},{"text":"and I'll be printing here the","start":2250.0,"duration":4.38},{"text":"spectrogram of this one here and so here","start":2251.89,"duration":4.62},{"text":"you can compare the two alright on the","start":2254.38,"duration":5.58},{"text":"first part here on this side here you're","start":2256.51,"duration":6.18},{"text":"gonna have this peak here at 1600 which","start":2259.96,"duration":8.01},{"text":"is the the higher power there we go now","start":2262.69,"duration":6.87},{"text":"you have a second one which is this peak","start":2267.97,"duration":8.67},{"text":"here you can see this peak right and you","start":2269.56,"duration":12.45},{"text":"see this peak yeah okay so these Peaks","start":2276.64,"duration":7.62},{"text":"are gonna be the actual notes I play","start":2282.01,"duration":3.51},{"text":"with the right hand","start":2284.26,"duration":3.3},{"text":"so let's actually put those together and","start":2285.52,"duration":3.69},{"text":"I'm gonna have here the frequencies so I","start":2287.56,"duration":5.58},{"text":"have 1600 1200 and 800 can you see here","start":2289.21,"duration":7.2},{"text":"I have 1600 and 800 Y one is double of","start":2293.14,"duration":7.41},{"text":"the other because they are one octave","start":2296.41,"duration":8.58},{"text":"apart so if this is this gonna be okay","start":2300.55,"duration":6.99},{"text":"and this is a fifth which is like a also","start":2304.99,"duration":4.98},{"text":"has a nice interval so then we actually","start":2307.54,"duration":4.74},{"text":"generate these signals here and then I","start":2309.97,"duration":4.8},{"text":"gotta be concatenate the mouth so I'm","start":2312.28,"duration":4.44},{"text":"gonna be playing both these the first","start":2314.77,"duration":6.09},{"text":"one is actually the original audio but","start":2316.72,"duration":5.389},{"text":"[Music]","start":2320.86,"duration":4.61},{"text":"let me try again","start":2322.109,"duration":3.361},{"text":"the second one the concatenation yeah so","start":2325.68,"duration":9.18},{"text":"it's a bit loud I can now cannot even","start":2330.78,"duration":5.88},{"text":"reduce the volume oh I can reduce it","start":2334.86,"duration":6.86},{"text":"here too much okay let me go again all","start":2336.66,"duration":5.06},{"text":"right","start":2342.02,"duration":3.33},{"text":"so this is the concatenation of these","start":2343.26,"duration":6.03},{"text":"four different pitches so guess what we","start":2345.35,"duration":7.03},{"text":"are going to be doing next so how can I","start":2349.29,"duration":5.91},{"text":"extract all the notes that I can hear in","start":2352.38,"duration":8.04},{"text":"a specific given piece so let's say I","start":2355.2,"duration":7.68},{"text":"you play a full score and I'd like to","start":2360.42,"duration":8.94},{"text":"know which pitch is play at what time of","start":2362.88,"duration":10.77},{"text":"what so the answer was convolution

is","start":2484.16,"duration":10.23},{"text":"it sampling issues right transitions so","start":2489.529,"duration":7.56},{"text":"whenever you have deep you actually have","start":2494.39,"duration":4.709},{"text":"one white waveform one waveform and then","start":2497.089,"duration":4.59},{"text":"the other one one away from his to

spike","start":2513.589,"duration":4.14},{"text":"because it's gonna get basically you can","start":2514.909,"duration":4.56},{"text":"think about the jump is like having a","start":2517.729,"duration":4.02},{"text":"very high frequency right because it's a","start":2519.469,"duration":4.47},{"text":"it's like a delta right so you actually","start":2521.749,"duration":3.72},{"text":"get all the frequencies that's why you","start":2523.939,"duration":4.55},{"text":"get all the frequencies here boom okay","start":2525.469,"duration":7.08},{"text":"makes sense right so far kind of alright","start":2528.489,"duration":7.5},{"text":"so this is the green version that I","start":2532.549,"duration":6.171},{"text":"cannot even sign and what","start":2535.989,"duration":5.101},{"text":"left side here why is on the

hand","start":2545.8,"duration":5.64},{"text":"the cold are the one I show you on the","start":2548.74,"duration":5.369},{"text":"bottom left side okay so let me

you","start":2557.32,"duration":5.67},{"text":"first all the kernels you can tell now","start":2560.2,"duration":5.04},{"text":"the red one is going to be the first","start":2562.99,"duration":5.1},{"text":"chunk of my signal they want the real","start":2565.24,"duration":4.92},{"text":"one and then you can see the first pitch","start":2568.09,"duration":5.19},{"text":"is gonna be the has the same frequency","start":2570.16,"duration":3.66},{"text":"can you see","start":2573.28,"duration":5.18},{"text":"so the problem have the same same same","start":2573.82,"duration":6.87},{"text":"delta T the same interval the same","start":2578.46,"duration":5.77},{"text":"period can you see you cannot nod your","start":2580.69,"duration":5.19},{"text":"head because again I don't see you had","start":2584.23,"duration":4.47},{"text":"to answer me can you see or not okay","start":2585.88,"duration":5.13},{"text":"thank you fantastic and so this one is","start":2588.7,"duration":4.35},{"text":"that the third one you can see that it","start":2591.01,"duration":3.87},{"text":"starts here in the period-- and it","start":2593.05,"duration":4.08},{"text":"finishes here if you go up here you're","start":2594.88,"duration":3.87},{"text":"gonna see exactly there were two of","start":2597.13,"duration":3.39},{"text":"these guys right so that's why you can","start":2598.75,"duration":3.72},{"text":"see that's how you can see this is like","start":2600.52,"duration":4.099},{"text":"twice the frequency of the one below","start":2602.47,"duration":5.04},{"text":"finally I'm gonna be performing the","start":2604.619,"duration":5.47},{"text":"convolution of these four corners with","start":2607.51,"duration":6.21},{"text":"my input signal and this is how we look","start":2610.089,"duration":6.75},{"text":"like okay so the first kernel has a high","start":2613.72,"duration":5.85},{"text":"match in the first part of the of the","start":2616.839,"duration":5.311},{"text":"score so between zero and zero five","start":2619.57,"duration":5.13},{"text":"seconds the second one starts just after","start":2622.15,"duration":4.68},{"text":"after the first one then you have the","start":2624.7,"duration":4.35},{"text":"third one starting at zero three I guess","start":2626.83,"duration":3.99},{"text":"and then you have the last one","start":2629.05,"duration":4.71},{"text":"starting at the zero six okay and so","start":2630.82,"duration":6.12},{"text":"guess what I'm gonna make you listen to","start":2633.76,"duration":5.04},{"text":"convolutions now are you excited","start":2636.94,"duration":5.58},{"text":"oh okay you actually answering now good","start":2638.8,"duration":6.289},{"text":"alright and so these are the outcomes","start":2642.52,"duration":4.92},{"text":"let me lower a little the volumes","start":2645.089,"duration":7.241},{"text":"otherwise you complain yeah I can't","start":2647.44,"duration":7.46},{"text":"lower the","start":2652.33,"duration":2.57},{"text":"okay so the first one let's try again","start":2656.8,"duration":6.89},{"text":"how cool is that it's just listen to","start":2668.88,"duration":8.23},{"text":"convolution okay so basically this was","start":2671.95,"duration":7.32},{"text":"on I have one more slide because I","start":2677.11,"duration":4.17},{"text":"felt like there was some confusion last","start":2679.27,"duration":4.11},{"text":"time about what is the different","start":2681.28,"duration":4.08},{"text":"dimensionality of different type of","start":2683.38,"duration":4.83},{"text":"signals so I'm really recommending to go","start":2685.36,"duration":5.49},{"text":"and take the class of young Bruna which","start":2688.21,"duration":4.68},{"text":"is math for deep learning and I stole","start":2690.85,"duration":5.73},{"text":"one of his you know small things he was","start":2692.89,"duration":5.28},{"text":"teaching I just put a one slide here","start":2696.58,"duration":7.74},{"text":"together for you so this slide is the","start":2698.17,"duration":12.99},{"text":"following so okay so we have the input","start":2704.32,"duration":8.82},{"text":"layer or the samples we provide into","start":2711.16,"duration":5.25},{"text":"this network and so usually our last","start":2713.14,"duration":5.28},{"text":"time I define this I have this curly X","start":2716.41,"duration":4.47},{"text":"which is gonna be made of those x i's","start":2718.42,"duration":4.59},{"text":"which are all my data same post right","start":2720.88,"duration":4.44},{"text":"and so I usually have em there are","start":2723.01,"duration":6.09},{"text":"samples so my I goes from n 1 to n ok so","start":2725.32,"duration":6.48},{"text":"is this clear on is this notation clear","start":2729.1,"duration":4.98},{"text":"because it's a bit more formal I use AMA","start":2731.8,"duration":4.95},{"text":"less formal but then somehow someone was","start":2734.08,"duration":4.95},{"text":"feeling a little bit not comfortable I","start":2736.75,"duration":5.31},{"text":"think so this one is just my input","start":2739.03,"duration":7.44},{"text":"samples but we we can also see this one","start":2742.06,"duration":7.2},{"text":"is this curly X which is my input set as","start":2746.47,"duration":6.48},{"text":"the set of all these functions as x i's","start":2749.26,"duration":7.23},{"text":"which are mapping my Omega capital Omega","start":2752.95,"duration":6.9},{"text":"which is my domain to a RC which are","start":2756.49,"duration":5.07},{"text":"going to be basically my channels of","start":2759.85,"duration":6.3},{"text":"that specific example in so here I'm","start":2761.56,"duration":6.24},{"text":"gonna be mapping those lowercase Omega","start":2766.15,"duration":7.89},{"text":"to these x i's of omega so let's see how","start":2767.8,"duration":7.62},{"text":"these different this from the previous","start":2774.04,"duration":3.51},{"text":"notation so I'm gonna give you now three","start":2775.42,"duration":3.75},{"text":"examples and I you should be able to","start":2777.55,"duration":3.75},{"text":"tell now what is the dimensionality and","start":2779.17,"duration":5.13},{"text":"is all in this example so the first one","start":2781.3,"duration":3.52},{"text":"let's say","start":2784.3,"duration":2.29},{"text":"I have likely one and show you right now","start":2784.82,"duration":4.74},{"text":"in the time just fun piece of you know","start":2786.59,"duration":5.34},{"text":"audio signal so my Omega is going to be","start":2789.56,"duration":5.31},{"text":"just the samples like sample number one","start":2791.93,"duration":4.98},{"text":"sample number two like the index right","start":2794.87,"duration":4.68},{"text":"so you have index one index to index","start":2796.91,"duration":5.76},{"text":"until these 70,000 whatever we just

the","start":2804.74,"duration":4.59},{"text":"number of seconds divided by the delta T","start":2806.48,"duration":4.8},{"text":"which would be the you know 1 over

discrete","start":2817.25,"duration":5.97},{"text":"samples so this is my input data and","start":2818.96,"duration":7.08},{"text":"then what about the image of

no","start":2873.02,"duration":5.25},{"text":"better thank you","start":2876.52,"duration":4.48},{"text":"let's say thanks to John alright second","start":2878.27,"duration":4.8},{"text":"example I have here my Omega is going to","start":2881.0,"duration":5.01},{"text":"be the Cartesian product of these two","start":2883.07,"duration":4.56},{"text":"sets the first set is going to be going","start":2886.01,"duration":4.89},{"text":"from 1 to the height and also this one","start":2887.63,"duration":5.52},{"text":"in discrete and the other one is going","start":2890.9,"duration":3.81},{"text":"to be going from 1 to the width so these","start":2893.15,"duration":3.87},{"text":"are the actual pictures and so this

here no dots around and so\non second element is gonna be a two okay","start":354.979,"duration":7.801},{"text":"X and then until the last one which is\ngonna be D okay there's no dot but sure","start":362.78,"duration":10.19},{"text":"like someone is calling that dot product\ninstead of the cross product but that is","start":372.97,"duration":4.84},{"text":"assumes like you use a

okay so we have Z 1 Z 2 and so on\nuntil Z M and this is my final set right","start":386.71,"duration":8.41},{"text":"my vector is that okay fantastic so now\nwe are going to be focusing a little bit","start":395.12,"duration":4.59},{"text":"about the meaning of this thing over\nhere okay other questions so far","start":399.71,"duration":8.88},{"text":"all right this is very trivial so far I\nhope I mean let me know if if not okay","start":408.59,"duration":5.94},{"text":"okay so let's analyze one of these guys\nhere so I'd like to figure out what is","start":414.53,"duration":5.61},{"text":"the meaning of writing a T times X right\nso my a T is gonna be my generic a I so","start":420.14,"duration":10.83},{"text":"let's assume in this case when

for","start":444.68,"duration":5.1},{"text":"you to understand so this one is gonna\nbe my a are these gonna be my alpha and","start":449.78,"duration":7.94},{"text":"then here you have like it's gonna be my\nX and is this gonna be here my X I so","start":457.72,"duration":10.9},{"text":"what is this what is the output of this\nproduct here these are here","start":468.62,"duration":8.81},{"text":"see you can sorry 8\/8 transpose it let's\ncall it let's say that is a row vector","start":478.21,"duration":10.26},{"text":"can you see know what is gonna be the\noutput of this operation here no why","start":490.03,"duration":17.85},{"text":"this is this is like a generic one of\nthe many aids right there are M

normal","start":523.31,"duration":7.35},{"text":"scalar product hold on\nso you have egg hey here do you have","start":530.66,"duration":12.06},{"text":"here this part here is gonna be a 1 it\nis gonna be a two okay then you have","start":542.72,"duration":5.79},{"text":"here x1 and now you have x2 right so how\ndo you express this scalar product here","start":548.51,"duration":10.04},{"text":"okay so I'm just writing let me know if\nyou took clear so I'm gonna write here a","start":559.98,"duration":6.75},{"text":"1 times X 1 plus a 2 times X 2 right\nthis is the definition clear right so","start":568.89,"duration":8.89},{"text":"far yeah no okay yeah question yeah that\nis meant to be a transpose Y a role","start":577.78,"duration":7.05},{"text":"times column vector so let's assume a is\na column vector then I have role x","start":584.83,"duration":4.77},{"text":"colouring so let's keep writing this\nstuff here so what is a 1 how can i","start":589.6,"duration":12.63},{"text":"compute AI a 1 second ok ok\nso I'm gonna write here the a 1 is going","start":602.23,"duration":12.99},{"text":"to be the length of vector a times\ncosine alpha then what about X 1 someone","start":615.22,"duration":5.55},{"text":"else the same right now wait what what\nis X 1 same thing right different","start":620.77,"duration":9.24},{"text":"letters so someone say something you're\nfollowing you're completely confused","start":630.01,"duration":7.44},{"text":"you're not having any idea it's too easy\nI have no idea what's going on here it's","start":637.45,"duration":5.76},{"text":"good right so far ok what's gonna be the\nsecond term the this one is gonna be X","start":643.21,"duration":10.56},{"text":"here write x cos x I right and then you\nhad the second term which is going to be","start":653.77,"duration":6.66},{"text":"what magnitude of a shout I can hear ok\nsine of alpha and then","start":660.43,"duration":13.49},{"text":"okay thank you okay","start":677.66,"duration":3.63},{"text":"all right I'm gonna be just putting\ntogether those two guys so you're gonna","start":683.93,"duration":3.94},{"text":"get equal magnitude of a times magnitude\nof x times cosine alpha cosine Phi plus","start":687.87,"duration":12.5},{"text":"sana sine alpha and sine cosine a sine X\nI sorry","start":700.37,"duration":7.84},{"text":"what is be starting the parentheses all\nright so there's the cosine of the","start":708.21,"duration":6.0},{"text":"difference of the two angle right\neveryone knows trigonometry here right","start":714.21,"duration":3.03},{"text":"sorry high school stuff so this one is\ngonna be equal to a x times the cosine","start":717.24,"duration":7.92},{"text":"of cos x i minus alpha right oh the\nother way around right from monoxides","start":725.16,"duration":5.84},{"text":"so what does this mean you can think\nabout each element so far is clear I I","start":731.0,"duration":6.04},{"text":"didn't do any magic yeah shake your head\nlike these four yes these four no this","start":737.04,"duration":5.64},{"text":"for maybe no something's working okay so\nyou can think about whenever you","start":742.68,"duration":5.13},{"text":"multiply a matrix times a vector that\nbasically each output of this operation","start":747.81,"duration":5.79},{"text":"is gonna be measuring so okay hold on\nwhat is this cosine how much is cosine","start":753.6,"duration":5.97},{"text":"of zero one so it means if these two\nangles if the two vectors are aligned","start":759.57,"duration":6.21},{"text":"which means there is a zero angle\nbetween the two vectors you can have the","start":765.78,"duration":4.68},{"text":"maximum value of this element right\nwhenever when you have the minus the","start":770.46,"duration":6.63},{"text":"most negative value when they are\nopposite right so when they're in","start":777.09,"duration":6.15},{"text":"opposition of phase you're gonna get the\nmost negative magnitude but then if you","start":783.24,"duration":5.07},{"text":"apply just let's a redo you're gonna cut\nall those negative things you're just","start":788.31,"duration":3.42},{"text":"checking for the positive matches right\nso neural net basically just perhaps","start":791.73,"duration":4.47},{"text":"who's gonna be figuring out only the\npositive matches right and so again when","start":796.2,"duration":4.32},{"text":"you multiply a matrix times a column\nvector you","start":800.52,"duration":3.1},{"text":"be performing element-wise sorry scalar\nproduct between each column each row of","start":803.62,"duration":7.71},{"text":"the matrix which represents your kernel\nright so whenever you have like a linear","start":811.33,"duration":4.89},{"text":"layer your kernel is gonna be the whole\nrow of the matrix and now you see what","start":816.22,"duration":3.78},{"text":"is the projection of that input on that\ncolumn I am on the input on that flow","start":820.0,"duration":7.05},{"text":"right so each element of this product is\ngoing to tell you the alignment with","start":827.05,"duration":5.85},{"text":"which the input is what is the alignment\nof the input with respect to the","start":832.9,"duration":4.68},{"text":"specific row of the matrix okay\nyes no this should shape some more like","start":837.58,"duration":7.02},{"text":"intuition while we are using these\nlinear transformations they are like","start":844.6,"duration":3.69},{"text":"allowing you to see the projection of\nthe input onto different kind of","start":848.29,"duration":4.85},{"text":"orientations let's say this way okay you\ncan try to you know extrapolate this in","start":853.14,"duration":9.16},{"text":"high dimensions I guess the intuition at\nleast I can give it to you works","start":862.3,"duration":3.84},{"text":"definitely in two and three dimensions\nin higher dimensions I kind of think it","start":866.14,"duration":4.44},{"text":"works in a similar way next lesson we\nare going to watch we are actually we","start":870.58,"duration":3.629},{"text":"are going to see how what is the\ndistribution of the projections in a","start":874.209,"duration":4.681},{"text":"higher dimensional space is this sort\ngonna be so cool I think all right so","start":878.89,"duration":4.35},{"text":"this was the first part of I think of\nthe class oh well there is one more more","start":883.24,"duration":6.539},{"text":"part so actually here this said here we\ncan also write it in a different way so","start":889.779,"duration":5.161},{"text":"maybe this is maybe it's known maybe\nit's not known when I saw it first time","start":894.94,"duration":5.19},{"text":"I didn't know so you know it's it's cool\nthat sometimes you see these things once","start":900.13,"duration":4.92},{"text":"again maybe so let's go back here is the\nthings that there and so you can express","start":905.05,"duration":5.4},{"text":"this Z as being equal the vector a 1 in\nthis case a 1 is gonna be the first","start":910.45,"duration":8.37},{"text":"column of the a matrix ok and this one\nis going to be multiplied by the scalar","start":918.82,"duration":4.01},{"text":"x1 now you have the second column of the\nmatrix so I have a 2 this is multiplied","start":922.83,"duration":6.55},{"text":"by the second element of the X right\nuntil the last one which is gonna be","start":929.38,"duration":5.49},{"text":"again I can't hear if it's M or n m like\nthis or end you know sign language which","start":934.87,"duration":10.06},{"text":"one n right you know sign language no\nyou should learn it's good you know","start":944.93,"duration":7.95},{"text":"inclusivity a and write the last column\ntimes your X and of course because n X","start":952.88,"duration":6.75},{"text":"has a size of n there are n items right\nand so basically when you also when you","start":959.63,"duration":4.47},{"text":"do a you know transformation a linear\nyou know apply a linear operator you","start":964.1,"duration":3.84},{"text":"can't be basically waiting each column\nof the matrix with the coefficient that","start":967.94,"duration":4.95},{"text":"is in a you know you have first column\ntimes the first coefficient of the","start":972.89,"duration":3.75},{"text":"vector second column and by the second\nitem plus third column times the third","start":976.64,"duration":5.49},{"text":"item and so you can see the output of\nthis DN transformation is a weighted sum","start":982.13,"duration":4.29},{"text":"of the columns of the a matrix okay so\nthis is a different kind of intuition","start":986.42,"duration":5.76},{"text":"sometimes you see these as like whenever\nyou want to express your signal your","start":992.18,"duration":4.44},{"text":"data is a combination of different you\nknow the composition this is kind of a","start":996.62,"duration":8.67},{"text":"linear composition of your input alright\nso that was the first part it is the","start":1005.29,"duration":5.31},{"text":"recap about the linear algebra a second\npart is going to be something even more","start":1010.6,"duration":6.93},{"text":"cool I think questions so far\nno easy too easy you're getting bored","start":1017.53,"duration":9.26},{"text":"sorry okay all right then I'm gonna\nspeed up I guess","start":1026.79,"duration":3.88},{"text":"alright so let's see how we can extend\nthe one that the stuff we have seen","start":1030.67,"duration":4.5},{"text":"right now to convolutions right so maybe\nconvolution sometimes are a little bit","start":1035.17,"duration":3.87},{"text":"weird let's see how we can do an\nextension to convolutions","start":1039.04,"duration":9.86},{"text":"all right so let's say I start with the\nsame matrix so I'm gonna have here four","start":1051.72,"duration":6.67},{"text":"rows and then three columns okay so my\ndata has to be if I had if I had this","start":1058.39,"duration":15.27},{"text":"matrix if I multiply this to a column my\ncolumn vector should be of size three","start":1073.66,"duration":5.7},{"text":"thank you all right so let me draw here\nmy column vector of size right and this","start":1079.36,"duration":4.89},{"text":"is gonna give you a output of size four\nokay fantastic","start":1084.25,"duration":4.559},{"text":"but then is your data let's say you're\ngonna listen to some nice audio audio","start":1088.809,"duration":6.931},{"text":"file is your data just three simple long\nhow long is gonna be your data let's say","start":1095.74,"duration":5.52},{"text":"you listening to a piece of music that\nis like three minutes","start":1101.26,"duration":3.33},{"text":"how many sample does three minutes of\nall your health yeah I guess what is","start":1104.59,"duration":7.74},{"text":"gonna be my sampling rate let's say\ntwenty two okay twenty two thousand kilo","start":1112.33,"duration":7.74},{"text":"Hertz right 22 kilohertz so how many\nsamples three minutes of music have","start":1120.07,"duration":6.41},{"text":"second you sure is monophonic\nor stereophonic just kidding okay so","start":1127.799,"duration":10.211},{"text":"you're gonna multiply the number of\nsample the number of seconds right","start":1138.01,"duration":4.64},{"text":"number of seconds times the frame rate\nright the okay the frequency in this","start":1142.65,"duration":6.01},{"text":"case anyhow so this signal is gonna be\nvery very long right it's gonna be keep","start":1148.66,"duration":3.96},{"text":"going down so if I have a vector that is\nvery very long I have I have to use a","start":1152.62,"duration":4.32},{"text":"matrix which is gonna be very very fat\nwide right okay fantastic so this top","start":1156.94,"duration":6.6},{"text":"keeps going this direction\nalright so my question for you is gonna","start":1163.54,"duration":3.54},{"text":"be what should I put in this location\nhere","start":1167.08,"duration":4.46},{"text":"what should I put here so do we care\nabout things that are further away","start":1175.57,"duration":12.45},{"text":"no why not\nbecause our data has the property of","start":1188.74,"duration":5.26},{"text":"locality fantastic so what am I gonna go\nwhat am I gonna be putting here a big","start":1194.0,"duration":6.299},{"text":"zero right fantastic mom okay so we put\na zero here and then what is the other","start":1200.299,"duration":6.391},{"text":"property so let me start drawing this\nstuff again right so can I have my","start":1206.69,"duration":3.119},{"text":"kernel of size three and then here I\nhave my data which is gonna be very long","start":1209.809,"duration":7.081},{"text":"right so hold on I can see all right so\nhere there are zero then let's say what","start":1216.89,"duration":14.279},{"text":"is the other property my my my date my\nnatural data have stationarity which","start":1231.169,"duration":5.791},{"text":"means the pattern that you expect to\nfind this can be kind of repeating over","start":1236.96,"duration":8.099},{"text":"and over again right and so if I have\nhere my three values here perhaps I'd","start":1245.059,"duration":4.081},{"text":"like to reuse them over and over again\nright and so if these three values let","start":1249.14,"duration":4.649},{"text":"me change the color maybe so you can see\nin there is the same stuff so I have","start":1253.789,"duration":6.99},{"text":"three values here and then I'm gonna be\nusing these three same values one step","start":1260.779,"duration":6.451},{"text":"for the rain and I keep going further I\ndon't down and I keep going this way all","start":1267.23,"duration":9.54},{"text":"right so what should I put here on the\nbottom what should I put here a zero","start":1276.77,"duration":6.029},{"text":"right why that why is that because of\nlocality of the data right so putting","start":1282.799,"duration":5.73},{"text":"zeros around is called it's also called\npadding but in this case it's called","start":1288.529,"duration":7.821},{"text":"sparsity right so this is

we have now how many","start":1324.33,"duration":5.76},{"text":"parameters I have on the right hand side","start":1330.09,"duration":3.44},{"text":"well so we have three parameters over\nleft on the

whole you have three parameters\none side on the other side you have 12","start":1348.9,"duration":7.91},{"text":"okay that is good using locality and\nspiral and whatever not like sparsity","start":1356.81,"duration":5.05},{"text":"and parameter sharing but then now we\nend up with just three parameters isn't","start":1361.86,"duration":3.75},{"text":"this too restrictive how

the\nfirst kernel down here now he has some","start":1381.57,"duration":6.66},{"text":"second kernel let's say listen and I\nhave last one here right and so you

here","start":1476.129,"duration":4.17},{"text":"such that Oh everything that is down\nhere it gets cleaned up right and then","start":1480.299,"duration":4.771},{"text":"finally I'm gonna be using

actually","start":1538.48,"duration":4.75},{"text":"make it glow green because it's green\nkarna so you have a one times what it's","start":1543.23,"duration":11.97},{"text":"gonna be from the number

later.","start":2132.14,"duration":2.92},{"text":"Anyhow, so this was like in the first","start":2135.06,"duration":4.22},{"text":"part you're gonna have the first note\nthere's A\u266d that you have a B\u266d","start":2139.29,"duration":3.99},{"text":"A\u266d and B so you have \u2026 and the and the\ndifference between the first pitch and","start":2143.28,"duration":8.27},{"text":"is one octave there for the first\nfrequency is gonna be twice the second","start":2151.55,"duration":5.89},{"text":"frequency okay so whenever we're gonna\nbe observing the waveform one sign will","start":2157.44,"duration":5.43},{"text":"have to a shorter like the half the\nperiod of the other one right the","start":2162.87,"duration":4.86},{"text":"especially the the a the a flat on

of","start":2172.41,"duration":7.59},{"text":"this one you get right okay okay so how\ndo we actually get these notes out from","start":2180.0,"duration":7.29},{"text":"that spectra from the from the

basically perform the Fourier\ntransform of the whole scene are you","start":2215.12,"duration":4.57},{"text":"gonna hear like the whole notes together\nall together right but then you can't","start":2219.69,"duration":6.78},{"text":"figure out which pitch is playing where\nor when actually in this case right","start":2226.47,"duration":6.79},{"text":"ha so we need kind of a

domain","start":2238.21,"duration":4.98},{"text":"you are using its called spectrograph\nright and so on I'm gonna be now","start":2243.19,"duration":4.2},{"text":"printing for you the spectrogram oh\nsorry","start":2247.39,"duration":2.61},{"text":"and I'll be printing here the\nspectrogram of this one here and so here","start":2250.0,"duration":4.38},{"text":"you can compare the two alright

now","start":2259.96,"duration":8.01},{"text":"you have a second one which is this peak\nhere you can see this peak right and you","start":2267.97,"duration":8.67},{"text":"see this peak yeah okay so these Peaks\nare gonna be the actual notes I play","start":2276.64,"duration":7.62},{"text":"with the right hand\nso let's actually put those together and","start":2284.26,"duration":3.3},{"text":"I'm gonna have here the frequencies so I\nhave 1600 1200 and 800 can you see here","start":2287.56,"duration":5.58},{"text":"I have 1600 and 800 Y one is double of\nthe other because they are one octave","start":2293.14,"duration":7.41},{"text":"apart so if this is this gonna be okay\nand this is a fifth which is like a also","start":2300.55,"duration":6.99},{"text":"has a nice interval so then we actually\ngenerate these signals here and then I","start":2307.54,"duration":4.74},{"text":"gotta be concatenate the mouth so I'm\ngonna be playing both these the first","start":2312.28,"duration":4.44},{"text":"one is actually the original audio but","start":2316.72,"duration":5.389},{"text":"let me try again","start":2322.109,"duration":3.361},{"text":"the

all","start":2334.86,"duration":6.86},{"text":"right\nso this is the concatenation of these","start":2342.02,"duration":3.33},{"text":"four different pitches so guess what we\nare going to be doing

convolution","start":2369.36,"duration":6.87},{"text":"of what no convolutional spectrogram so\nyou have convolution of your input","start":2376.23,"duration":7.14},{"text":"signal with what with some different\nkind of pitches right which pitches will","start":2383.37,"duration":6.09},{"text":"you pick let's say you don't see the\nspectrum because let's say I'm I just","start":2389.46,"duration":9.69},{"text":"play any kind of piece of music so I'd\nlike to know all possible notes they are","start":2399.15,"duration":4.62},{"text":"there what would you do","start":2403.77,"duration":2.45},{"text":"you don't know all pitches how would you\ntry that right so in which are all the","start":2406.22,"duration":7.21},{"text":"pitches you may want to use if you're if\nI'm playing the piano all the keys of","start":2413.43,"duration":7.47},{"text":"the piano right so if I have if I play a\nconcerto with the piano then I want to","start":2420.9,"duration":3.63},{"text":"have like a piece of audio for each of\nthose keys and I'm gonna be running","start":2424.53,"duration":3.48},{"text":"convolutions of my whole piece with the\nold kids right and therefore you're","start":2428.01,"duration":4.68},{"text":"gonna see hits which are the alignment\nof the cosine similarity","start":2432.69,"duration":3.78},{"text":"whenever you get basic\nthe audio matching your specific kernel","start":2436.47,"duration":4.879},{"text":"so I'm gonna be doing this but with\nthese specific tones I actually extract","start":2441.349,"duration":5.64},{"text":"it here so here I'm going to be showing\nyou first how the two spectrograms look","start":2446.989,"duration":5.94},{"text":"like the left side is going to be the\nspectrogram of my actual signal X of T","start":2452.929,"duration":4.77},{"text":"and on the right hand side I have just\nthe spectrogram of this concatenation of","start":2457.699,"duration":3.931},{"text":"my pitches so here you can clearly see\nthis but then here is first of all what","start":2461.63,"duration":9.119},{"text":"are these bars here these vertical bars","start":2470.749,"duration":3.68},{"text":"you follow me right I can see you had to\nactually talk back what are these red","start":2475.269,"duration":5.32},{"text":"bars here vertical bars now it don't\ntell van I already told you right","start":2480.589,"duration":3.571},{"text":"these are and the vertical what what is\nit sampling issues right transitions so","start":2484.16,"duration":10.23},{"text":"whenever you have deep you actually have\none white waveform one waveform and then","start":2494.39,"duration":4.709},{"text":"the other one one away from his to stop\nso it's no longer periodic and whenever","start":2499.099,"duration":4.92},{"text":"you do a Fourier transform of a non\nperiodic signal you get you know crop","start":2504.019,"duration":3.59},{"text":"that's why whenever you get the junk to\nthe junk junction between these the jump","start":2507.609,"duration":5.98},{"text":"here you're gonna have this spike\nbecause it's gonna get basically you can","start":2513.589,"duration":4.14},{"text":"think about the jump is like having a\nvery high frequency right because it's a","start":2517.729,"duration":4.02},{"text":"it's like a delta right so you actually\nget all the frequencies that's why you","start":2521.749,"duration":3.72},{"text":"get all the frequencies here boom okay\nmakes sense right so far kind of alright","start":2525.469,"duration":7.08},{"text":"so this is the green version that I\ncannot even sign and what","start":2532.549,"duration":6.171},{"text":"left side here why is on the left-hand\nside all red down there okay","start":2538.72,"duration":7.08},{"text":"yes you know so the left side left hand\nthe cold are the one I show you on the","start":2545.8,"duration":5.64},{"text":"bottom left side okay so let me finish\nthis class and then I'll let you go so","start":2551.44,"duration":5.88},{"text":"here I'm gonna be convoyed show you\nfirst all the kernels you can tell now","start":2557.32,"duration":5.67},{"text":"the red one is going to be the first\nchunk of my signal they want the real","start":2562.99,"duration":5.1},{"text":"one and then you can see the first pitch\nis gonna be the has the same frequency","start":2568.09,"duration":5.19},{"text":"can you see\nso the problem have the same same same","start":2573.28,"duration":5.18},{"text":"delta T the same interval the same\nperiod can you see you cannot nod your","start":2578.46,"duration":5.77},{"text":"head because again I don't see you had\nto answer me can you see or not okay","start":2584.23,"duration":4.47},{"text":"thank you fantastic and so this one is\nthat the third one you can see that it","start":2588.7,"duration":4.35},{"text":"starts here in the period-- and it\nfinishes here if you go up here you're","start":2593.05,"duration":4.08},{"text":"gonna see exactly there were two of\nthese guys right so that's why you can","start":2597.13,"duration":3.39},{"text":"see that's how you can see this is like\ntwice the frequency of the one below","start":2600.52,"duration":4.099},{"text":"finally I'm gonna be performing the\nconvolution of these four corners with","start":2604.619,"duration":5.47},{"text":"my input signal and this is how we look\nlike okay so the first kernel has a high","start":2610.089,"duration":6.75},{"text":"match in the first part of the of the\nscore so between zero and zero five","start":2616.839,"duration":5.311},{"text":"seconds the second one starts just after\nafter the first one then you have the","start":2622.15,"duration":4.68},{"text":"third one starting at zero three I guess\nand then you have the last one","start":2626.83,"duration":3.99},{"text":"starting at the zero six okay and so\nguess what I'm gonna make you listen to","start":2630.82,"duration":6.12},{"text":"convolutions now are you excited\noh okay you actually answering now good","start":2636.94,"duration":5.58},{"text":"alright and so these are the outcomes\nlet me lower a little the volumes","start":2642.52,"duration":4.92},{"text":"otherwise you complain yeah I can't\nlower the","start":2647.44,"duration":7.46},{"text":"okay so the first one let's try again","start":2656.8,"duration":6.89},{"text":"how cool is that it's just listen to\nconvolution okay so basically this was","start":2668.88,"duration":8.23},{"text":"on shit I have one more slide because I\nfelt like there was some confusion last","start":2677.11,"duration":4.17},{"text":"time about what is the different\ndimensionality of different type of","start":2681.28,"duration":4.08},{"text":"signals so I'm really recommending to go\nand take the class of young Bruna which","start":2685.36,"duration":5.49},{"text":"is math for deep learning and I stole\none of his you know small things he was","start":2690.85,"duration":5.73},{"text":"teaching I just put a one slide here\ntogether for you so this slide is the","start":2696.58,"duration":7.74},{"text":"following so okay so we have the input\nlayer or the samples we provide into","start":2704.32,"duration":8.82},{"text":"this network and so usually our last\ntime I define this I have this curly X","start":2713.14,"duration":5.28},{"text":"which is gonna be made of those x i's\nwhich are all my data same post right","start":2718.42,"duration":4.59},{"text":"and so I usually have em there are\nsamples so my I goes from n 1 to n ok so","start":2723.01,"duration":6.09},{"text":"is this clear on is this notation clear\nbecause it's a bit more formal I use AMA","start":2729.1,"duration":4.98},{"text":"less formal but then somehow someone was\nfeeling a little bit not comfortable I","start":2734.08,"duration":4.95},{"text":"think so this one is just my input\nsamples but we we can also see this one","start":2739.03,"duration":7.44},{"text":"is this curly X which is my input set as\nthe set of all these functions as x i's","start":2746.47,"duration":6.48},{"text":"which are mapping my Omega capital Omega\nwhich is my domain to a RC which are","start":2752.95,"duration":6.9},{"text":"going to be basically my channels of\nthat specific example in so here I'm","start":2759.85,"duration":6.3},{"text":"gonna be mapping those lowercase Omega\nto these x i's of omega so let's see how","start":2766.15,"duration":7.89},{"text":"these different this from the previous\nnotation so I'm gonna give you now three","start":2774.04,"duration":3.51},{"text":"examples and I you should be able to\ntell now what is the dimensionality and","start":2777.55,"duration":3.75},{"text":"is all in this example so the first one\nlet's say","start":2781.3,"duration":3.52},{"text":"I have likely one and show you right now\nin the time just fun piece of you know","start":2784.82,"duration":4.74},{"text":"audio signal so my Omega is going to be\njust the samples like sample number one","start":2789.56,"duration":5.31},{"text":"sample number two like the index right\nso you have index one index to index","start":2794.87,"duration":4.68},{"text":"until these 70,000 whatever we just saw\nright now okay and the last value is","start":2799.55,"duration":5.19},{"text":"going to be the T capital T which is the\nnumber of seconds divided by the delta T","start":2804.74,"duration":4.59},{"text":"which would be the you know 1 over the\nfrequency and this is going to be a","start":2809.33,"duration":3.87},{"text":"subset of n right so this is a discrete\nnumber of samples because you have a","start":2813.2,"duration":4.05},{"text":"computer you always have discrete\nsamples so this is my input data and","start":2817.25,"duration":5.97},{"text":"then what about the image of this\nfunction so when I ask what is the","start":2823.22,"duration":6.09},{"text":"dimensionality of this type of signal\nyou should answer this is a","start":2829.31,"duration":4.02},{"text":"one-dimensional signal because the power\nof these n here is 1 ok so this is like","start":2833.33,"duration":6.03},{"text":"a 1 dimensional signal although you may\nhave the total total time and sorry the","start":2839.36,"duration":5.64},{"text":"1 there it was a sampling interval on\nthe right hand side you have the number","start":2845.0,"duration":3.9},{"text":"of channels can be 1 if you have a mono\nsignal you can have 2 if you have a","start":2848.9,"duration":4.44},{"text":"stereophonic so you have mono there you\nhave a 2\/4 stereophonic or what is 5","start":2853.34,"duration":4.89},{"text":"plus 1 that should all be like 5.1 how\ncool alright so this is still a one","start":2858.23,"duration":6.42},{"text":"dimensional signal which may have\nmultiple channels nevertheless is still","start":2864.65,"duration":3.78},{"text":"one dimensional signal because there is\nonly one running variable there ok is it","start":2868.43,"duration":4.59},{"text":"somehow better than last time yes no\nbetter thank you","start":2873.02,"duration":5.25},{"text":"let's say thanks to John alright second\nexample I have here my Omega is going to","start":2878.27,"duration":4.8},{"text":"be the Cartesian product of these two\nsets the first set is going to be going","start":2883.07,"duration":4.56},{"text":"from 1 to the height and also this one\nin discrete and the other one is going","start":2887.63,"duration":5.52},{"text":"to be going from 1 to the

my","start":2897.02,"duration":4.67},{"text":"domain what are the possible channels we\nhave so here the possible channels that","start":2901.69,"duration":7.0},{"text":"are very very common are the

the","start":2912.44,"duration":4.409},{"text":"rainbow there the color and therefore\nyou get like my X which is a function of","start":2916.849,"duration":5.94},{"text":"the coordinates w1 sorry
