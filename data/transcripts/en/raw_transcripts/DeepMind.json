the","start":352.199,"duration":5.271},{"text":"details but I would just like to point","start":354.72,"duration":6.03},{"text":"briefly pointed out so this measure

this","start":424.32,"duration":4.44},{"text":"complexity is low then this term is","start":426.24,"duration":5.43},{"text":"great and if this complexity is

the","start":527.1,"duration":5.1},{"text":"beautiful thing is that this framework","start":530.61,"duration":3.39},{"text":"is so general some people would

the","start":1274.509,"duration":3.601},{"text":"other is that none of the information","start":1276.759,"duration":4.65},{"text":"that's exchanged when clinicians

of","start":1369.67,"duration":5.04},{"text":"two things that are driving the patient","start":1372.64,"duration":4.5},{"text":"experience in hospital the first is how","start":1374.71,"duration":4.53},{"text":"do we identify which patients are at","start":1377.14,"duration":4.05},{"text":"risk of deterioration at any moment and","start":1379.24,"duration":4.05},{"text":"there's two or three sources of data","start":1381.19,"duration":3.87},{"text":"here there's the stuff that already","start":1383.29,"duration":4.44},{"text":"exists on the very clunky and painful","start":1385.06,"duration":5.61},{"text":"and old-school digital systems as well","start":1387.73,"duration":4.8},{"text":"as the paper-based record and I think","start":1390.67,"duration":3.87},{"text":"you'll be very surprising to most people","start":1392.53,"duration":4.11},{"text":"although not many of the junior doctors","start":1394.54,"duration":4.08},{"text":"and consultants and nurses who work in","start":1396.64,"duration":4.41},{"text":"the systems just to to realize that","start":1398.62,"duration":4.05},{"text":"actually a lot of these systems these","start":1401.05,"duration":3.63},{"text":"desktop-based old-school systems that","start":1402.67,"duration":3.48},{"text":"are in deployment at the moment were","start":1404.68,"duration":3.48},{"text":"actually developed for completely","start":1406.15,"duration":4.53},{"text":"different ecosystems so firstly largely","start":1408.16,"duration":5.28},{"text":"in the US and secondly often originally","start":1410.68,"duration":4.62},{"text":"those systems were built for logistics","start":1413.44,"duration":4.26},{"text":"or accounting so not really designed for","start":1415.3,"duration":4.29},{"text":"healthcare from the ground up thinking","start":1417.7,"duration":3.47},{"text":"about the user need all the way through","start":1419.59,"duration":4.26},{"text":"and so the first job is to take","start":1421.17,"duration":4.33},{"text":"advantage of all the data that currently","start":1423.85,"duration":4.14},{"text":"exists both both that which is digitized","start":1425.5,"duration":4.26},{"text":"and that which needs to be digitized and","start":1427.99,"duration":4.44},{"text":"then secondly use that to escalate

of","start":1442.12,"duration":4.53},{"text":"what a truly digitized healthcare","start":1444.37,"duration":4.86},{"text":"experience might actually look like here","start":1446.65,"duration":4.86},{"text":"we have our patient Robert who was","start":1449.23,"duration":5.01},{"text":"admitted yesterday with a complaint of a","start":1451.51,"duration":5.79},{"text":"severe abdominal pain and so he was kept","start":1454.24,"duration":5.01},{"text":"in overnight for observations and

simple","start":1465.7,"duration":3.96},{"text":"he's able to swipe across update the","start":1467.44,"duration":4.35},{"text":"number and immediately we see that

worked","start":266.17,"duration":2.63},{"text":"with teams in Google Brain\nto build models to control","start":268.8,"duration":4.17},{"text":"the cooling

TensorFlow,","start":281.527,"duration":1.833},{"text":"and they're getting\nhot doing so.","start":283.36,"duration":1.72},{"text":"So we have these fans\nat the back, which","start":285.08,"duration":2.17},{"text":"pull that cold air\nover the servers","start":287.25,"duration":1.68},{"text":"into this hot aisle, where it\ntravels down and is transferred","start":288.93,"duration":3.72},{"text":"into a water cooling system.","start":292.65,"duration":2.35},{"text":"So here are some\npipes and some pumps.","start":295.0,"duration":2.24},{"text":"And the pipes take the hot\nwater from the hot aisle","start":297.24,"duration":2.73},{"text":"to the chillers on the roof,\nand the cold water from those","start":299.97,"duration":2.58},{"text":"chillers back to the cold aisle.","start":302.55,"duration":2.482},{"text":"And here's what those\ncooling towers look like.","start":305.032,"duration":1.958},{"text":"They're just big fans\nwhich take the water","start":306.99,"duration":2.07},{"text":"and cool it down into the air.","start":309.06,"duration":3.48},{"text":"So we spent a while\nworking on this offline.","start":312.54,"duration":2.31},{"text":"We had to take into\naccount safety.","start":314.85,"duration":3.36},{"text":"The model couldn't go\nand try random things,","start":318.21,"duration":3.78},{"text":"otherwise we'd break\nbillion-dollar data centers,","start":321.99,"duration":2.34},{"text":"which is never great.","start":324.33,"duration":1.69},{"text":"And we had to work out how\nto do a bit of exploration","start":326.02,"duration":2.6},{"text":"as well, because if we\njust learned on the data","start":328.62,"duration":2.37},{"text":"which we had available,\nthe model would probably","start":330.99,"duration":3.026},{"text":"never learn to do\nanything more optimal","start":334.016,"duration":1.624},{"text":"than what the human\noperators had done.","start":335.64,"duration":4.77},{"text":"So we iterated a bit,\nand when it eventually","start":340.41,"duration":2.16},{"text":"came time to experiment,\nwe turned it on,","start":342.57,"duration":1.95},{"text":"and we saw this nice drop.","start":344.52,"duration":2.16},{"text":">From my experience, it's\nkind of rare to see

it.","start":351.06,"duration":1.26},{"text":"So we had this initial\nresult, and it came time","start":355.5,"duration":3.03},{"text":"to implement it.","start":358.53,"duration":1.11},{"text":"Because the data\ncenters didn't really","start":359.64,"duration":2.49},{"text":"have the infrastructure\nset up to run, and train,","start":362.13,"duration":4.59},{"text":"and evaluate, and verify\nmachine learning models,","start":366.72,"duration":2.94},{"text":"we had to write a lot\nof this ourselves.","start":369.66,"duration":3.48},{"text":"So we did that.","start":373.14,"duration":0.72},{"text":"We took our original\nTorch models","start":373.86,"duration":1.62},{"text":"and moved them to TensorFlow.","start":375.48,"duration":1.26},{"text":"We built up all this\ntraining, and validation,","start":376.74,"duration":2.16},{"text":"and serving

kind","start":395.55,"duration":2.0},{"text":"of infrastructure stuff.","start":397.55,"duration":1.4},{"text":"Cool.","start":401.974,"duration":2.178},{"text":"So another example\nwhere TensorFlow","start":404.152,"duration":1.458},{"text":"helped us is we\npreviously had this system","start":405.61,"duration":1.98},{"text":"called Gorila, which stands for\ngeneral reinforcement learning","start":407.59,"duration":3.72},{"text":"architecture, with some extra\nletters thrown in there.","start":411.31,"duration":2.992},{"text":"And we wrote this,\ninitially, to speed up","start":417.04,"duration":1.86},{"text":"training of DQN style agents.","start":418.9,"duration":2.73},{"text":"So what this was was a framework\nbuilt on top of disbelief.","start":421.63,"duration":5.31},{"text":"We had the parameters\nof an agent stored","start":426.94,"duration":2.85},{"text":"across multiple\nparameter

server","start":433.389,"duration":2.041},{"text":"and interacting with\nenvironments to get experience.","start":435.43,"duration":3.21},{"text":"That experience was then stored\nin a distributed

parameters.","start":446.431,"duration":0.999},{"text":"And the whole thing kind\nof cycled around like that.","start":447.43,"duration":2.867},{"text":"By doing it this way, we\ncould get more experience","start":450.297,"duration":2.083},{"text":"faster because we\nhad multiple agents,","start":452.38,"duration":1.83},{"text":"and we could learn\nfaster because we","start":454.21,"duration":1.5},{"text":"had multiple learners.","start":455.71,"duration":2.32},{"text":"But often, more than the\nspeed of convergence,","start":458.03,"duration":1.999},{"text":"we often saw that sometimes\nthese models actually","start":460.029,"duration":2.041},{"text":"did better than models\ntrained on single servers.","start":462.07,"duration":3.739},{"text":"And we think that\nhad something to do","start":465.809,"duration":1.541},{"text":"with the breaking\nof correlations","start":467.35,"duration":2.4},{"text":"between the examples we\ntrained on from time to time.","start":469.75,"duration":3.72},{"text":"This also was one\nof the

later","start":475.27,"duration":2.7},{"text":"developed.","start":477.97,"duration":2.81},{"text":"So with the introduction\nof TensorFlow,","start":480.78,"duration":1.98},{"text":"we were able to\nbasically deprecate this","start":482.76,"duration":1.806},{"text":"because much of\nthe functionality","start":484.566,"duration":1.374},{"text":"is handled by\nTensorFlow or can be","start":485.94,"duration":1.95},{"text":"written from within\nTensorFlow, which is great","start":487.89,"duration":3.51},{"text":"because it's less time\nwe need to spend on

projects.","start":496.32,"duration":3.8},{"text":"More generally, since we've\nstarted using TensorFlow,","start":500.12,"duration":2.26},{"text":"we've seen a reduction\nacross the board","start":502.38,"duration":1.95},{"text":"in the amount of ancillary\nwork we have to perform.","start":504.33,"duration":3.06},{"text":"And things are only getting\nbetter as TensorFlow","start":507.39,"duration":2.0},{"text":"and the ecosystem around\nit continues to develop.","start":509.39,"duration":3.519},{"text":"So one of these is\nthe high-level

nice.","start":551.67,"duration":2.48},{"text":"The distributed\ntraining helps us.","start":554.15,"duration":2.79},{"text":"We can try more things\nquicker and sooner.","start":556.94,"duration":4.097},{"text":"And finally, once we've\ngone through all this work","start":561.037,"duration":2.083},{"text":"and we're excited and wanting\nto put them all into

that.","start":363.04,"duration":1.8},{"text":"And what we've been\nvery committed to do","start":364.84,"duration":1.92},{"text":"is to try to train\nan algorithm to learn","start":366.76,"duration":2.29},{"text":"its own representation\nof the world","start":369.05,"duration":2.15},{"text":"through interaction\nwith some environment.","start":371.2,"duration":2.96},{"text":"So all of our systems begin\nwith the training of a machine","start":374.16,"duration":2.92},{"text":"learning system, or an agent.","start":377.08,"duration":1.93},{"text":"That agent has some goal, which\nis defined by the human being,","start":379.01,"duration":4.03},{"text":"and it's able to interact\nwith some

terms.","start":386.36,"duration":1.04},{"text":"It could be a robotic system\ninteracting with a kitchen","start":387.4,"duration":3.37},{"text":"or a car manufacturing plant.","start":390.77,"duration":2.376},{"text":"It could be YouTube,\nwhere the environment is","start":393.146,"duration":1.874},{"text":"to try to recommend\nvideos that people watch,","start":395.02,"duration":2.88},{"text":"or it could be an energy grid.","start":397.9,"duration":2.19},{"text":"And that agent is able\nto take a set of

YouTube","start":405.66,"duration":1.97},{"text":"or controlling a robotic arm.","start":407.63,"duration":2.09},{"text":"And then the environment passes\nback a set of state updates.","start":409.72,"duration":4.21},{"text":"So after the interaction\nwith the environment,","start":413.93,"duration":2.93},{"text":"the environment has\nsomehow changed.","start":416.86,"duration":1.87},{"text":"And so all the sensors\nthat collect information","start":418.73,"duration":2.2},{"text":"about that environment send\nthe updated observations","start":420.93,"duration":2.69},{"text":"back to the agent.","start":423.62,"duration":1.08},{"text":"And it's through this\nprocess of interaction","start":424.7,"duration":2.6},{"text":"through reinforcement\nlearning, we're","start":427.3,"duration":1.62},{"text":"able to train agents to learn\ntheir own representation","start":428.92,"duration":2.86},{"text":"of what it takes to\noptimize some goal.","start":431.78,"duration":4.04},{"text":"And right in the\nbeginning, we were","start":435.82,"duration":1.87},{"text":"very successful in\ntraining our algorithms","start":437.69,"duration":1.93},{"text":"on the old-school Atari testbed.","start":439.62,"duration":1.57},{"text":"So many of you will\nbe familiar with this.","start":441.19,"duration":1.75},{"text":"It's like 100 or so Atari\ngames from the '70s and '80s.","start":442.94,"duration":3.88},{"text":"And the environment is\nsimply a set of raw pixels.","start":446.82,"duration":3.28},{"text":"So at every frame, we're\npassing back a set of RGB,","start":450.1,"duration":4.1},{"text":"or red, green, blue\nvalues, to the algorithm","start":454.2,"duration":3.1},{"text":"based on where that sits in\na frame, on an x and y-axis.","start":457.3,"duration":6.64},{"text":"And so really there's no\npre-programmed knowledge.","start":463.94,"duration":2.46},{"text":"Everything is\nlearned from scratch.","start":466.4,"duration":1.6},{"text":"So we're not hand coding any\ninsight into the algorithm.","start":468.0,"duration":3.95},{"text":"We're not saying, this\nis what a color is","start":471.95,"duration":1.96},{"text":"or this is what motion\nand dynamics are,","start":473.91,"duration":1.9},{"text":"or this is a paddle,\nthis is an enemy.","start":475.81,"duration":2.23},{"text":"We're really saying\ngiven this set of pixels,","start":478.04,"duration":2.6},{"text":"over time can you optimize\nyour goal function,","start":480.64,"duration":3.94},{"text":"which is to get more reward,\nby tweaking the action buttons?","start":484.58,"duration":4.11},{"text":"And so that is really\nall we give to the agent.","start":488.69,"duration":2.35},{"text":"We just wire them up\nto the action buttons","start":491.04,"duration":2.42},{"text":"and give them the motivation of\ntrying to optimize for score.","start":493.46,"duration":2.59},{"text":"So really the best intuition is\nto think about a robot standing","start":496.05,"duration":3.54},{"text":"in an arcade being fed the\npixels from the video screen","start":499.59,"duration":3.9},{"text":"and fiddling around with the\njoystick and the fire button","start":503.49,"duration":3.02},{"text":"in order to find out\nwhat the association is","start":506.51,"duration":3.41},{"text":"between the set of actions it's\nable to take, the set of pixels","start":509.92,"duration":3.239},{"text":"that it saw in the\nlast few frames,","start":513.159,"duration":2.221},{"text":"and the reward that it gets.","start":515.38,"duration":1.175},{"text":"It's kind of just simple\nassociative learning","start":516.555,"duration":1.874},{"text":"at one level.","start":518.429,"duration":2.151},{"text":"So let me give you a sense\nfor what this looks like.","start":520.58,"duration":2.44},{"text":"This is the old\ngame of Breakout.","start":523.02,"duration":2.33},{"text":"And here we are after\n100 games, the agent's","start":525.35,"duration":2.09},{"text":"just arrived in the environment.","start":527.44,"duration":1.63},{"text":"So it really has\nno idea what to do.","start":529.07,"duration":1.81},{"text":"It's sort of moving\naround left and right,","start":530.88,"duration":1.93},{"text":"trying to explore the\nspace and randomly discover","start":532.81,"duration":3.97},{"text":"what kind of actions\nseem to be rewarding.","start":536.78,"duration":2.7},{"text":"After 300 games,\nit seems to have","start":539.48,"duration":2.18},{"text":"learned pretty well that\nthere's a strong association","start":541.66,"duration":2.799},{"text":"between moving the bat\ninto the right place","start":544.459,"duration":1.791},{"text":"to hit the ball back\nat the right time.","start":546.25,"duration":2.41},{"text":"And this is pretty\nmuch human performance.","start":548.66,"duration":1.98},{"text":"This is better than I can play.","start":550.64,"duration":2.23},{"text":"But interestingly, we left\nit training for 500 games","start":552.87,"duration":3.252},{"text":"overnight, and it developed\nthis really cool strategy","start":556.122,"duration":2.208},{"text":"where it tunnels the\nball up the sides","start":558.33,"duration":2.47},{"text":"to get maximum points\nwith minimum effort.","start":560.8,"duration":2.46},{"text":"And this was super\nsurprising to us","start":563.26,"duration":2.02},{"text":"as engineers because it was\nreally cool in some sense","start":565.28,"duration":3.72},{"text":"because many humans don't\nrealize that strategy when","start":569.0,"duration":2.41},{"text":"playing the game,\nand it was something","start":571.41,"duration":1.75},{"text":"that emerged through\nthe agent interacting","start":573.16,"duration":3.54},{"text":"with the game on its own.","start":576.7,"duration":1.6},{"text":"So it's really surprising\nto see the first signs,","start":578.3,"duration":2.32},{"text":"the complex behaviors,\nrelatively complex behaviors,","start":580.62,"duration":3.49},{"text":"can emerge without us\nhand-crafting those features","start":584.11,"duration":2.431},{"text":"in.","start":586.541,"duration":0.499},{"text":"So this was really\nexciting to us two","start":587.04,"duration":2.19},{"text":"and a half, three years ago.","start":589.23,"duration":2.39},{"text":"Another example is the\ngame of Space Invaders.","start":591.62,"duration":2.98},{"text":"And so this is a video\nof before training.","start":594.6,"duration":2.73},{"text":"You can see that it's getting\nkilled all of the time.","start":597.33,"duration":3.24},{"text":"It's sort of randomly\nfiring around.","start":600.57,"duration":1.71},{"text":"It doesn't realize that\nthose things are denying it,","start":602.28,"duration":2.48},{"text":"when it gets hit by\none of those

bunch","start":613.724,"duration":1.916},{"text":"of really interesting dynamics.","start":615.64,"duration":1.389},{"text":"So first of all,\nyou can see it often","start":617.029,"duration":1.541},{"text":"hiding behind the orange\nobstacle, because it knows","start":618.57,"duration":2.71},{"text":"that if it gets hit by\none of those missiles","start":621.28,"duration":2.05},{"text":"it's in big trouble.","start":623.33,"duration":1.49},{"text":"Secondly, you can see\nthat it's actually","start":624.82,"duration":1.89},{"text":"often aiming at the top.","start":626.71,"duration":1.137},{"text":"So it's trying to\nget those ones first","start":627.847,"duration":1.583},{"text":"because it gets more reward.","start":629.43,"duration":1.166},{"text":"Here, we see the\npink mothership.","start":630.596,"duration":1.494},{"text":"And it does an incredible\npredictive shot","start":632.09,"duration":1.86},{"text":"to try and get that because it\ngets more reward for hitting","start":633.95,"duration":3.77},{"text":"that at the right time.","start":637.72,"duration":1.759},{"text":"And the other thing is you can\nsee that it very rarely

19","start":698.64,"duration":3.59},{"text":"by 19 board.","start":702.23,"duration":1.32},{"text":"And if you're white, I'm black.","start":703.55,"duration":2.36},{"text":"And the objective is to\ntry and place stones such","start":705.91,"duration":2.15},{"text":"that you surround your\nopponent's territory.","start":708.06,"duration":2.51},{"text":"So there's really no\nfurther rules than that.","start":710.57,"duration":2.17},{"text":"It's very unstructured.","start":712.74,"duration":2.01},{"text":"It's very abstract.","start":714.75,"duration":1.69},{"text":"And there are no\nsort of tricks that","start":716.44,"duration":1.54},{"text":"help you to exploit\nstructure in the space.","start":717.98,"duration":3.53},{"text":"So in chess, for\nexample, all the pieces","start":721.51,"duration":1.94},{"text":"are worth different\namounts, and so you","start":723.45,"duration":2.05},{"text":"can focus all your energy\non protecting your

space","start":739.34,"duration":1.92},{"text":"is really absolutely enormous.","start":741.26,"duration":2.05},{"text":"It's a 3,000-year-old game.","start":743.31,"duration":1.45},{"text":"And believe it or not,\nit's incredibly popular","start":744.76,"duration":3.429},{"text":"all over the world.","start":748.189,"duration":0.791},{"text":"There are 40 million\nplayers

play","start":753.65,"duration":1.69},{"text":"is that there are 10 to the\npower of 170 possible state","start":755.34,"duration":3.93},{"text":"spaces on a 19 by 19 board.","start":759.27,"duration":3.08},{"text":"So just to give a sense\nof what this means,","start":762.35,"duration":2.4},{"text":"it's a 10 with 170\nzeros on to describe","start":764.75,"duration":3.07},{"text":"the number of possible\nboard configurations","start":767.82,"duration":3.26},{"text":"that are possible in the game.","start":771.08,"duration":3.72},{"text":"And it's been estimated that\nthere are something like 10","start":774.8,"duration":3.24},{"text":"to the 70, so 10 with 70 zeros\nafter it, atoms in the known","start":778.04,"duration":5.44},{"text":"universe.","start":783.48,"duration":0.66},{"text":"In every liquid, solid, and\ngas in the known

number","start":796.18,"duration":2.77},{"text":"to intuit and get\nyour head around.","start":798.95,"duration":2.092},{"text":"This is roughly what\nthe branching

space.","start":807.58,"duration":1.486},{"text":"And so here there\nare something like 10","start":809.066,"duration":1.624},{"text":"to the power of 40\npossible board positions.","start":810.69,"duration":3.45},{"text":"And so for every\npossible move, there","start":814.14,"duration":2.39},{"text":"arise another set of\nmoves that are possible,","start":816.53,"duration":1.96},{"text":"and then another\nset, and another set.","start":818.49,"duration":1.87},{"text":"And this branches out for\nabout 100 or so, and that","start":820.36,"duration":2.78},{"text":"roughly makes up 10\nto the power of 40","start":823.14,"duration":2.17},{"text":"or so possible board positions.","start":825.31,"duration":2.72},{"text":"But this is what it\nlooks like for there","start":828.03,"duration":2.25},{"text":"to be 10 to the power of 170\npossible board

move.","start":837.32,"duration":2.3},{"text":"And so trying to model structure\nin a space that is so large","start":839.62,"duration":4.07},{"text":"is really very, very difficult.\nWriting an evaluation function","start":843.69,"duration":3.38},{"text":"to know if you're in a strong\nposition or a weak position","start":847.07,"duration":2.46},{"text":"is incredibly hard.","start":849.53,"duration":1.18},{"text":"And so all of the top players\nessentially rely on intuition.","start":850.71,"duration":4.844},{"text":"And that branching\nfactor that you","start":855.554,"duration":1.416},{"text":"see there goes on for\n200 possible branches","start":856.97,"duration":3.18},{"text":"until you reach the\nend of the game.","start":860.15,"duration":3.07},{"text":"So we trained two\ndifferent neural networks","start":863.22,"duration":2.99},{"text":"that learn a representation of\nwhat is effective in the space.","start":866.21,"duration":3.16},{"text":"The first is to basically say,\ngiven a set of possible moves","start":869.37,"duration":4.87},{"text":"that might be valuable at\nthis particular position,","start":874.24,"duration":3.04},{"text":"how do I identify which\none I should take.","start":877.28,"duration":2.0},{"text":"So here what we see is\nthat, the green layer,","start":879.28,"duration":2.49},{"text":"there's 10 different positions\nthat have been identified.","start":881.77,"duration":2.79},{"text":"And that network has been\ntrained on past games,","start":884.56,"duration":2.97},{"text":"100,000 or so past games.","start":887.53,"duration":2.39},{"text":"So we're learning from the\nvery best of human knowledge","start":889.92,"duration":4.39},{"text":"to bootstrap our\nalgorithm to start","start":894.31,"duration":2.42},{"text":"from at least the best that\nhuman knowledge has to provide.","start":896.73,"duration":2.74},{"text":"And once a particular\nposition has been identified,","start":899.47,"duration":4.4},{"text":"the algorithm then trains\na different network","start":903.87,"duration":2.4},{"text":"to search the value of\nthat particular position.","start":906.27,"duration":3.31},{"text":"And so we're trying\nto figure out","start":909.58,"duration":1.6},{"text":"the probability of\nwinning if we roll forward","start":911.18,"duration":2.9},{"text":"from this kind of position.","start":914.08,"duration":2.89},{"text":"And so both of these networks\nwork in tandem with one","start":916.97,"duration":2.41},{"text":"another to make a guess at\nwhich movie should be taken.","start":919.38,"duration":5.73},{"text":"Earlier this year, we played\nthe world champion, Lee Sedol,","start":925.11,"duration":4.26},{"text":"over in Seoul in Korea for\na $1 million live

exciting.","start":947.48,"duration":2.29},{"text":"We won four to one.","start":949.77,"duration":1.13},{"text":"And widely recognized to be a\ndecade earlier than expected.","start":950.9,"duration":4.56},{"text":"And it created an\nincredible buzz.","start":955.46,"duration":2.43},{"text":"So there were 280\nmillion live

surreal","start":961.77,"duration":2.98},{"text":"given each game is about\nfour or five hours long.","start":964.75,"duration":4.39},{"text":"So it's of intense.","start":969.14,"duration":2.14},{"text":"35,000 press articles.","start":971.28,"duration":1.54},{"text":"So, incredibly, it\ncaused a shortage","start":972.82,"duration":1.68},{"text":"of the sale of Go boards, which\nwas also quite remarkable when","start":974.5,"duration":3.17},{"text":"you consider they're\nkind of bits of wood","start":977.67,"duration":1.93},{"text":"with some stones on top.","start":979.6,"duration":1.19},{"text":"So we're really excited\nabout the buzz and energy","start":980.79,"duration":2.56},{"text":"that it created.","start":983.35,"duration":0.93},{"text":"And, again, we were\nlucky enough to manage","start":984.28,"duration":2.61},{"text":"to get a Nature\npaper and, of

work.","start":994.42,"duration":4.12},{"text":"But, of course,\nour real motivation","start":998.54,"duration":2.55},{"text":"is to develop these systems\nso that we can actually","start":1001.09,"duration":2.6},{"text":"make progress on some of our\nmost intractable problems.","start":1003.69,"duration":2.42},{"text":"That's what motivates\nus at

ways","start":1009.29,"duration":1.624},{"text":"is what makes our\norganization so exceptional.","start":1010.914,"duration":2.516},{"text":"I think the really smartest\npeople in the

people.","start":1018.58,"duration":1.5},{"text":"But I think what's\nalso really important","start":1020.08,"duration":1.99},{"text":"and becoming really clear I\nthink in the last five years","start":1022.07,"duration":2.46},{"text":"at least is that those\npeople have the freedom","start":1024.53,"duration":2.65},{"text":"to work on any\nproblem in the world.","start":1027.18,"duration":1.55},{"text":"They can go to any\nlab or to any company,","start":1028.73,"duration":3.088},{"text":"they can take their

world,","start":1035.2,"duration":2.7},{"text":"and know that you are\nactually working hard","start":1037.9,"duration":2.199},{"text":"to try to change the model\nof running an

structures","start":1046.16,"duration":2.42},{"text":"and do things quite differently.","start":1048.58,"duration":2.16},{"text":"So we took the same\nkind of methods","start":1050.74,"duration":1.67},{"text":"and we actually\ndeployed them to see","start":1052.41,"duration":1.5},{"text":"if we could make Google's data\ncenters much more efficient.","start":1053.91,"duration":3.446},{"text":"And what we did, so\nwe trained a model","start":1057.356,"duration":2.584},{"text":"to look at all the past\nretrospective sensor","start":1059.94,"duration":2.67},{"text":"data that describes how\nthe data center operates.","start":1062.61,"duration":4.67},{"text":"And this includes data,\nthings like air pressure","start":1067.28,"duration":3.94},{"text":"and temperature, incoming server\nload, and so on and so forth.","start":1071.22,"duration":4.06},{"text":"And what we're able\nto do is train a model","start":1075.28,"duration":1.75},{"text":"to use power more\nefficiently to deliver","start":1077.03,"duration":3.94},{"text":"exactly the same performance.","start":1080.97,"duration":1.74},{"text":"So there were no\nglitches I hope in any","start":1082.71,"duration":2.04},{"text":"of your experience of watching\nYouTube or any of your search","start":1084.75,"duration":3.08},{"text":"results.","start":1087.83,"duration":0.73},{"text":"But all the while, we\nmanaged to deliver exactly","start":1088.56,"duration":2.0},{"text":"the

this is quite exciting\nbecause it gives us a hint","start":1097.18,"duration":3.13},{"text":"that these kinds of very\nlarge learning methods","start":1100.31,"duration":4.02},{"text":"can be used for very\nhard real-world problems.","start":1104.33,"duration":2.91},{"text":"And I think one of the things\nwe're really excited about now","start":1107.24,"duration":2.5},{"text":"is how we might\nbe able to deploy","start":1109.74,"duration":1.374},{"text":"these very general\nalgorithms for load balancing","start":1111.114,"duration":2.946},{"text":"on the national

space","start":1117.02,"duration":2.91},{"text":"and the real-world data\nis really, really noisy.","start":1119.93,"duration":2.747},{"text":"And what we really need\nto do is design

systems.","start":1128.29,"duration":2.47},{"text":"And so, ultimately, what we're\nexcited about is the potential","start":1130.76,"duration":3.27},{"text":"to use these same\nsystems in any building","start":1134.03,"duration":3.34},{"text":"to predict incoming load and\nadjust the energy required","start":1137.37,"duration":3.74},{"text":"to operate that piece of\ninfrastructure

thing","start":1182.2,"duration":1.92},{"text":"that we discovered is\nthat there is actually","start":1184.12,"duration":2.32},{"text":"an incredible amount\nof really rich data","start":1186.44,"duration":2.32},{"text":"that describes your\nexperience when","start":1188.76,"duration":1.78},{"text":"you're admitted in a

the challenge\nis that it sits","start":1196.2,"duration":1.51},{"text":"in charts like this at\nthe bottom of your bed.","start":1197.71,"duration":3.0},{"text":"And so this is, for\nexample, a fluid

facing.","start":1341.83,"duration":1.96},{"text":"And actually a really\ninteresting study","start":1343.79,"duration":2.24},{"text":"came out earlier this\nyear from the BMJ","start":1346.03,"duration":3.39},{"text":"that has estimated that\nmedical error is actually","start":1349.42,"duration":2.1},{"text":"the third leading cause\nof death in the US.","start":1351.52,"duration":2.82},{"text":"And so everybody thinks\nthat the numbers in the UK","start":1354.34,"duration":2.89},{"text":"are very, very underestimated.","start":1357.23,"duration":4.03},{"text":"Something like 250,000 people\ndie a year preventatively","start":1361.26,"duration":5.08},{"text":"because of medical\nerror in the US.","start":1366.34,"duration":2.88},{"text":"It's the third biggest killer.","start":1369.22,"duration":2.31},{"text":"And so largely\nthere's two things","start":1371.53,"duration":1.89},{"text":"that are driving the patient\nexperience in hospital.","start":1373.42,"duration":2.6},{"text":"The first is how do we identify\nwhich patients are at risk","start":1376.02,"duration":3.6},{"text":"of deterioration at any moment.","start":1379.62,"duration":1.74},{"text":"And there's two or three\nsources of data here.","start":1381.36,"duration":2.36},{"text":"There's the stuff\nthat already exists","start":1383.72,"duration":2.11},{"text":"on the very clunky and painful\nand old school digital systems,","start":1385.83,"duration":4.56},{"text":"as well as the\npaper-based record.","start":1390.39,"duration":1.889},{"text":"And I think it would be very\nsurprising to most people,","start":1392.279,"duration":2.291},{"text":"although not to many\nof the junior doctors","start":1394.57,"duration":2.23},{"text":"and consultants and nurses\nwho work in the systems,","start":1396.8,"duration":2.37},{"text":"to realize that actually\na lot of these systems,","start":1399.17,"duration":3.38},{"text":"these desktop-based old school\nsystems that are in deployment","start":1402.55,"duration":2.84},{"text":"at the moment, were actually\ndeveloped for completely","start":1405.39,"duration":2.76},{"text":"different ecosystems.","start":1408.15,"duration":1.22},{"text":"So firstly, largely in the US.","start":1409.37,"duration":2.28},{"text":"And secondly, often\noriginally those systems","start":1411.65,"duration":2.54},{"text":"were built for\nlogistics or accounting.","start":1414.19,"duration":1.95},{"text":"So not really designed for\nhealth care from the ground up,","start":1416.14,"duration":3.06},{"text":"thinking about the user\nneed all the way through.","start":1419.2,"duration":2.94},{"text":"And so the first job is to\ntake advantage of all the data","start":1422.14,"duration":2.86},{"text":"that currently exists, both\nthat which is digitized","start":1425.0,"duration":3.14},{"text":"and that which needs\nto be digitized.","start":1428.14,"duration":2.09},{"text":"And then secondly, use that to\nescalate care more effectively.","start":1430.23,"duration":3.18},{"text":"So once you've\nidentified which patients","start":1433.41,"duration":1.84},{"text":"are at risk of deterioration\nby looking at all the data,","start":1435.25,"duration":2.77},{"text":"how do you manage\nthe coordination","start":1438.02,"duration":1.48},{"text":"of that intervention\nmore effectively.","start":1439.5,"duration":3.03},{"text":"And so let me take you\nthrough an example of what","start":1442.53,"duration":2.29},{"text":"a truly digitized health care\nexperience might actually","start":1444.82,"duration":3.01},{"text":"look like.","start":1447.83,"duration":1.24},{"text":"Here we have our\npatient, Robert,","start":1449.07,"duration":1.55},{"text":"who was admitted\nyesterday with a complaint","start":1450.62,"duration":3.39},{"text":"of a severe abdominal pain.","start":1454.01,"duration":2.46},{"text":"And so he was kept in\novernight for observations.","start":1456.47,"duration":2.58},{"text":"And our ward nurse, Jamie,\nis taking his temperature.","start":1459.05,"duration":3.05},{"text":"He's able to record\nthe temperature","start":1462.1,"duration":2.17},{"text":"on his mobile phone,\non his iPhone.","start":1464.27,"duration":2.111},{"text":"And it's really pretty simple.","start":1466.381,"duration":1.249},{"text":"He's able to swipe\nacross, update the number,","start":1467.63,"duration":2.67},{"text":"and immediately we see that\nthe temperature is actually","start":1470.3,"duration":2.79},{"text":"39.2 degrees.","start":1473.09,"duration":2.02},{"text":"And so this is obviously\nsuper concerning.","start":1475.11,"duration":1.81},{"text":"And it's generated what's called\nan Early Warning Score, which","start":1476.92,"duration":3.11},{"text":"immediately triggers an\nalert to the doctor on call.","start":1480.03,"duration":4.51},{"text":"She is able to read that\ninformation in the lift","start":1484.54,"duration":2.75},{"text":"and immediately realize that\nactually this patient needs","start":1487.29,"duration":2.96},{"text":"to be seen by me\nvery, very quickly.","start":1490.25,"duration":2.21},{"text":"She scrubs through\non her mobile phone","start":1492.46,"duration":1.78},{"text":"and looks up the\nname of the patient.","start":1494.24,"duration":1.88},{"text":"So there's structured search\nacross all of the key features","start":1496.12,"duration":2.954},{"text":"in the hospital.","start":1499.074,"duration":0.666},{"text":"She can search by consultant,\nby ward, by specialty,","start":1499.74,"duration":5.26},{"text":"she can search my medical\nrecord number or date of birth.","start":1505.0,"duration":3.039},{"text":"And here she's typing in\nthe name of the patient.","start":1508.039,"duration":2.041},{"text":"So she can pull up Robert\nJones and immediately view","start":1510.08,"duration":2.74},{"text":"his profile.","start":1512.82,"duration":0.83},{"text":"So this for the\nfirst time aggregates","start":1513.65,"duration":2.51},{"text":"all of the data that is being\ncollected across the hospital","start":1516.16,"duration":2.52},{"text":"system from the\npatient's perspective.","start":1518.68,"duration":2.69},{"text":"And so what she's presented\nwith immediately is an overview.","start":1521.37,"duration":3.63},{"text":"What is this\npatient's allergies?","start":1525.0,"duration":1.77},{"text":"Why have they been admitted\nin this current episode?","start":1526.77,"duration":2.81},{"text":"What are their\nunderlying diagnosis?","start":1529.58,"duration":1.65},{"text":"She can see here that this\npatient's had tonsillitis, also","start":1531.23,"duration":3.63},{"text":"suffers from asthma, in the\npast had a tonsilectomy.","start":1534.86,"duration":3.57},{"text":"She can scrub down and see\nwhat medication they're on","start":1538.43,"duration":2.69},{"text":"and she can see all\nof the observations","start":1541.12,"duration":1.79},{"text":"and any other details that are\nrelevant and most immediately","start":1542.91,"duration":2.9},{"text":"necessary in the overview.","start":1545.81,"duration":1.68},{"text":"If she swipes across, she can\nsee a different stream of data.","start":1547.49,"duration":3.74},{"text":"She can see the linear\ntimeline of everything","start":1551.23,"duration":2.52},{"text":"that's happened to\nthis patient in order.","start":1553.75,"duration":2.272},{"text":"So in the last few\nminutes, she can","start":1556.022,"duration":1.458},{"text":"see that this patient's actually\ntriggered a sepsis alert.","start":1557.48,"duration":2.805},{"text":"It looks like they\nmay be at risk","start":1560.285,"duration":1.375},{"text":"of a very serious infection.","start":1561.66,"duration":1.684},{"text":"They've got an\nacute kidney injury","start":1563.344,"duration":1.416},{"text":"alert, which means\nthat they're probably","start":1564.76,"duration":1.666},{"text":"dehydrated in their kidneys\nor are at great risk.","start":1566.426,"duration":2.864},{"text":"We can see that they've\nbeen sent for bloods.","start":1569.29,"duration":2.08},{"text":"The bloods have been ordered\nand they've been taken,","start":1571.37,"duration":1.81},{"text":"but they've not\nyet been collected.","start":1573.18,"duration":1.458},{"text":"So she doesn't have to call down\nto the pathology lab to say,","start":1574.638,"duration":2.862},{"text":"is this blood test result ready.","start":1577.5,"duration":1.52},{"text":"She can immediately\nsee on her mobile phone","start":1579.02,"duration":2.26},{"text":"that actually this\nis a test that needs","start":1581.28,"duration":2.14},{"text":"to be reviewed and examined.","start":1583.42,"duration":1.57},{"text":"She can also see other\nradiology reports","start":1584.99,"duration":2.2},{"text":"and any other\ninformation she needs.","start":1587.19,"duration":1.74},{"text":"She can click on more detail\nto see every single blood","start":1588.93,"duration":3.16},{"text":"test that's been taken\nabout this patient,","start":1592.09,"duration":3.05},{"text":"look at trend analysis,\nlook at previous graphs,","start":1595.14,"duration":2.77},{"text":"compare that with all of the\nother important statistics.","start":1597.91,"duration":2.53},{"text":"So here as she can see that\nthe potassium has spiked.","start":1600.44,"duration":2.3},{"text":"This patient has a dangerously\nhigh level of potassium rising,","start":1602.74,"duration":2.96},{"text":"at 6.2.","start":1605.7,"duration":0.704},{"text":"She can see that the white\nblood cell count is high,","start":1606.404,"duration":2.166},{"text":"which probably means there's\nan infection and was probably","start":1608.57,"duration":2.54},{"text":"why the sepsis alert was\ntriggered in the first place.","start":1611.11,"duration":4.069},{"text":"She can also now, having\nknown that there's","start":1615.179,"duration":1.791},{"text":"an sepsis risk, go\nand look in more","start":1616.97,"duration":2.68},{"text":"detail at that\nradiology exam, where","start":1619.65,"duration":1.604},{"text":"she can see that the report\nsays that there's a right lobe","start":1621.254,"duration":2.416},{"text":"pneumonia.","start":1623.67,"duration":0.93},{"text":"She can zoom in on that, compare\nthat to what she's seen before,","start":1624.6,"duration":3.32},{"text":"and share it with a colleague\nand get a second opinion.","start":1627.92,"duration":2.41},{"text":"And this has all happened before\nshe's arrived at the bedside.","start":1630.33,"duration":2.68},{"text":"She's not even met\nthe patient yet.","start":1633.01,"duration":1.472},{"text":"There's no need to arrive\nand look through the charts","start":1634.482,"duration":2.208},{"text":"and then take a case history.","start":1636.69,"duration":1.48},{"text":"She's done all of this in\nthe corridor, in the lift,","start":1638.17,"duration":3.022},{"text":"and on her way\nthere so that she is","start":1641.192,"duration":1.458},{"text":"prepped and ready to give\nher full human attention","start":1642.65,"duration":3.3},{"text":"to that patient at the bedside.","start":1645.95,"duration":2.335},{"text":"Now she's here and she's\nbeen able to examine","start":1648.285,"duration":1.875},{"text":"Robert's condition.","start":1650.16,"duration":1.28},{"text":"She can text her consultant\nand say actually this patient.","start":1651.44,"duration":4.057},{"text":"Looks like they might need\nan appendectomy they probably","start":1655.497,"duration":2.333},{"text":"basically just need\ntheir appendix out.","start":1657.83,"duration":2.55},{"text":"And so her consultant\ncan-- so now","start":1660.38,"duration":2.5},{"text":"what we've enabled is effective\nescalation by very fast","start":1662.88,"duration":3.38},{"text":"real-time communication.","start":1666.26,"duration":1.44},{"text":"And her consultant can\ntext back and confirm","start":1667.7,"duration":2.92},{"text":"that actually this patient\ndoes need an appendectomy","start":1670.62,"duration":3.46},{"text":"and we should start\ninstigating all of the jobs","start":1674.08,"duration":2.79},{"text":"and procedures and tasks,\nboth automatic and human, that","start":1676.87,"duration":3.15},{"text":"need to take place.","start":1680.02,"duration":0.95},{"text":"So here we see Jamie,\nour ward nurse,","start":1680.97,"duration":2.69},{"text":"texting back saying I'm\ngoing to go ahead and do","start":1683.66,"duration":3.25},{"text":"the blood cultures and\nso on and so forth.","start":1686.91,"duration":2.69},{"text":"So this is our consultant who's\npreparing for the operation.","start":1689.6,"duration":3.32},{"text":"She's got her own\nphone and she's","start":1692.92,"duration":1.91},{"text":"able to tap on admit the patient\nand prepare them for surgery.","start":1694.83,"duration":4.6},{"text":"And automatically we see that\na whole series of subtasks","start":1699.43,"duration":3.62},{"text":"get dispatched across\nthe whole hospital.","start":1703.05,"duration":2.35},{"text":"So we can see that this patient\nneeds to be nil by mouth,","start":1705.4,"duration":2.92},{"text":"they need intravenous\nfluids, someone","start":1708.32,"duration":2.51},{"text":"needs to write up\nthe antibiotics,","start":1710.83,"duration":2.13},{"text":"they need to be consented,\nand so on and so forth.","start":1712.96,"duration":2.71},{"text":"And so all these jobs get\nsent to the right person","start":1715.67,"duration":2.38},{"text":"so that they can be carried\nout at the right time.","start":1718.05,"duration":2.457},{"text":"And obviously, following\nRobert's operation,","start":1720.507,"duration":1.833},{"text":"we can still follow up with\nall of the live observations","start":1722.34,"duration":2.333},{"text":"and results.","start":1724.673,"duration":0.837},{"text":"Our clinician, our\nsurgeon, can still","start":1725.51,"duration":2.742},{"text":"read through all\nof the information","start":1728.252,"duration":1.458},{"text":"that she needs to see from home\nand keep tabs and communicate","start":1729.71,"duration":2.974},{"text":"with her team so\nthat she can take","start":1732.684,"duration":1.416},{"text":"care of the patient in a\nremote and ongoing way.","start":1734.1,"duration":2.762},{"text":"But ultimately, what\nwe really want to do","start":1736.862,"duration":1.708},{"text":"is put the patient in control.","start":1738.57,"duration":1.66},{"text":"The patient owns\nthe data about her.","start":1740.23,"duration":3.33},{"text":"And we want to make that\navailable on a personal mobile","start":1743.56,"duration":2.63},{"text":"device so that he or she can\nplay a much more active role","start":1746.19,"duration":4.25},{"text":"in administering their\ncare and potentially","start":1750.44,"duration":2.04},{"text":"connect up other data\nsources to better manage","start":1752.48,"duration":2.65},{"text":"their own conditions.","start":1755.13,"duration":1.74},{"text":"And I really believe that\nthis kind of digitization","start":1756.87,"duration":2.48},{"text":"has the potential to truly\ntransform health care.","start":1759.35,"duration":2.275},{"text":"One of the big challenges that\nwe face in the world today","start":1761.625,"duration":2.375},{"text":"is of obesity and diabetes.","start":1764.0,"duration":2.12},{"text":"So 26% of prevalence of\ndiabetes among adults in England","start":1766.12,"duration":4.15},{"text":"is massively rising.","start":1770.27,"duration":1.237},{"text":"And you're much more\nlikely, in fact, you're","start":1771.507,"duration":1.833},{"text":"25 times more likely, to\nsuffer some kind of sight loss","start":1773.34,"duration":3.39},{"text":"if you do have diabetes.","start":1776.73,"duration":1.57},{"text":"And yet 98% of that sight\nloss is completely preventable","start":1778.3,"duration":3.707},{"text":"if you can get in there\nearly and detect it.","start":1782.007,"duration":1.833},{"text":"So these are\npreventable problems","start":1783.84,"duration":2.02},{"text":"if we can get access to\nthe data in real time","start":1785.86,"duration":2.73},{"text":"and identify who\nis at risk of that.","start":1788.59,"duration":2.162},{"text":"So what we've been doing is\nworking with the Moorfields Eye","start":1790.752,"duration":2.458},{"text":"Hospital to look\nat these OCT scans.","start":1793.21,"duration":2.51},{"text":"So these are 3D videos\nof your eye, if you like.","start":1795.72,"duration":3.07},{"text":"And one of the\nchallenges is that we","start":1798.79,"duration":1.5},{"text":"have a 10x shortage of\nradiologists to actually review","start":1800.29,"duration":3.52},{"text":"these images.","start":1803.81,"duration":0.95},{"text":"And so there's massive\ndelays in detecting disease","start":1804.76,"duration":2.239},{"text":"and this can lead to blindness.","start":1806.999,"duration":1.291},{"text":"And so what we\nreally want to do is","start":1808.29,"duration":1.458},{"text":"build algorithms that\ncan learn to

segmentation","start":1817.21,"duration":2.44},{"text":"that we train our\nalgorithms to do.","start":1819.65,"duration":2.184},{"text":"And this, I think,\nwill enable much
