you","start":292.419,"duration":3.81},{"text":"know naively one thing we could do is","start":294.009,"duration":5.46},{"text":"actually just pass in each image into

so","start":471.419,"duration":4.951},{"text":"we've done so far it doesn't work super","start":473.79,"duration":4.11},{"text":"well it's unclear actually how well","start":476.37,"duration":2.88},{"text":"it'll ever work it does work better than","start":477.9,"duration":2.82},{"text":"random but it's not working super well","start":479.25,"duration":3.84},{"text":"it's not typically what people do when","start":480.72,"duration":3.72},{"text":"they encounter the situation where they","start":483.09,"duration":3.299},{"text":"want to do one-shot learning what they","start":484.44,"duration":4.8},{"text":"really do is they share weights

thing","start":496.47,"duration":2.91},{"text":"to know and it's actually really","start":498.09,"duration":4.049},{"text":"effective in this case it's one of the","start":499.38,"duration":3.95},{"text":"things we have to do to make this thing","start":502.139,"duration":4.471},{"text":"really work well and the intuition is","start":503.33,"duration":5.89},{"text":"that the model that we're running on the","start":506.61,"duration":4.44},{"text":"first input image and the model it","start":509.22,"duration":3.42},{"text":"running on the second input image really","start":511.05,"duration":2.82},{"text":"it seems like they should be the

and","start":515.909,"duration":5.31},{"text":"so the transform that you want to do on","start":519.63,"duration":2.67},{"text":"one image seems like it shouldn't really","start":521.219,"duration":3.031},{"text":"be the transform that we do on the other","start":522.3,"duration":4.77},{"text":"image in order to do this in order

because","start":534.39,"duration":5.1},{"text":"when we define a layer in the in the","start":535.98,"duration":5.43},{"text":"functional definition we actually it","start":539.49,"duration":3.48},{"text":"sort of just sets up the specification","start":541.41,"duration":3.179},{"text":"for the layer and it doesn't actually","start":542.97,"duration":3.96},{"text":"really attach it to some input until we","start":544.589,"duration":4.651},{"text":"call a function on that layer once","start":546.93,"duration":5.909},{"text":"specified so then we set up a model","start":549.24,"duration":5.25},{"text":"right and so we actually say that the","start":552.839,"duration":2.821},{"text":"input is going to be this input and","start":554.49,"duration":3.33},{"text":"actually what the model does is going to","start":555.66,"duration":3.869},{"text":"be this flat and step in then the stent","start":557.82,"duration":4.01},{"text":"step but now we haven't actually","start":559.529,"duration":5.971},{"text":"attached this model to any input so what","start":561.83,"duration":4.57},{"text":"we're gonna do we're actually gonna","start":565.5,"duration":2.64},{"text":"attach it to two different inputs we're","start":566.4,"duration":4.59},{"text":"gonna attach it to input 1 and input 2","start":568.14,"duration":4.29},{"text":"and so I call the model that's attached","start":570.99,"duration":3.81},{"text":"to input 1 dense 1 and the model","start":572.43,"duration":5.04},{"text":"attached to input 2 dense 2 so we have","start":574.8,"duration":5.42},{"text":"two separate models but they're attached","start":577.47,"duration":5.06},{"text":"two different inputs so we can actually","start":580.22,"duration":3.87},{"text":"take those and we can use that same","start":582.53,"duration":3.6},{"text":"concatenate layer that we used before to","start":584.09,"duration":4.68},{"text":"combine them and then we can add that","start":586.13,"duration":4.29},{"text":"same dense layer that we had before and","start":588.77,"duration":3.9},{"text":"that's gonna output a single number and","start":590.42,"duration":4.14},{"text":"we're going to use a sigmoid activation","start":592.67,"duration":3.81},{"text":"layer and that number is obviously going","start":594.56,"duration":3.48},{"text":"to be one if we think that these two","start":596.48,"duration":4.2},{"text":"images are corresponding the same number","start":598.04,"duration":4.58},{"text":"and zero if they're like two different","start":600.68,"duration":4.59},{"text":"numbers so we can pile the model in the","start":602.62,"duration":4.45},{"text":"same way we did before and then we can","start":605.27,"duration":4.5},{"text":"take a quick look at it and we can see","start":607.07,"duration":3.78},{"text":"that actually this model should have","start":609.77,"duration":2.91},{"text":"about half the number of parameters of","start":610.85,"duration":3.51},{"text":"the previous model because we're sharing","start":612.68,"duration":3.75},{"text":"those parameters right so whereas before","start":614.36,"duration":3.87},{"text":"we had kind of two layers each with a","start":616.43,"duration":3.36},{"text":"hundred thousand parameters now we only","start":618.23,"duration":3.3},{"text":"have one set of a hundred thousand","start":619.79,"duration":3.75},{"text":"parameters but it's it's actually two","start":621.53,"duration":3.96},{"text":"different layers are getting called but","start":623.54,"duration":5.31},{"text":"each of those shared parameters so we","start":625.49,"duration":6.42},{"text":"can run this model too and spoiler alert","start":628.85,"duration":5.37},{"text":"it works a little bit better than the","start":631.91,"duration":4.16},{"text":"last thing we did but not a lot better","start":634.22,"duration":5.25},{"text":"because there's actually one more fancy","start":636.07,"duration":5.35},{"text":"optimization that we need to add in and","start":639.47,"duration":3.41},{"text":"then we'll have kind of the typical","start":641.42,"duration":3.51},{"text":"setup of what's called the siamese","start":642.88,"duration":4.06},{"text":"Network which is actually an old

renewed","start":649.67,"duration":4.47},{"text":"interest in various forms as people have","start":651.98,"duration":4.38},{"text":"gotten more and more excited about deep","start":654.14,"duration":3.51},{"text":"learning and it's kind of one shot","start":656.36,"duration":3.75},{"text":"learning problem specifically so you","start":657.65,"duration":4.44},{"text":"knew from Charis import back-end as Kay","start":660.11,"duration":3.6},{"text":"and this kind of harkens back to the","start":662.09,"duration":3.75},{"text":"time when Karis had typically multiple","start":663.71,"duration":4.11},{"text":"backends these days really it's almost","start":665.84,"duration":4.26},{"text":"always tensorflow so I just sort of look","start":667.82,"duration":3.68},{"text":"at any tensorflow","start":670.1,"duration":3.39},{"text":"operation is something that I can run","start":671.5,"duration":5.53},{"text":"here and now I define a function where","start":673.49,"duration":5.31},{"text":"it takes in inputs which actually going","start":677.03,"duration":4.23},{"text":"to be tensor flow tensors and then I can","start":678.8,"duration":5.4},{"text":"call K dot and then any tensor flow of","start":681.26,"duration":4.77},{"text":"operation that I can find so here I'm","start":684.2,"duration":4.56},{"text":"using some and square and square root","start":686.03,"duration":5.76},{"text":"and maximum really all this is doing is","start":688.76,"duration":5.76},{"text":"it's basically looking at the sum of the","start":691.79,"duration":5.64},{"text":"squares of the differences between the","start":694.52,"duration":5.13},{"text":"two inputs right so it's kind of a","start":697.43,"duration":4.02},{"text":"simple they call Euclidean distance it's","start":699.65,"duration":3.39},{"text":"really just how different are the","start":701.45,"duration":3.81},{"text":"outputs of my two different networks","start":703.04,"duration":3.18},{"text":"that's what we're gonna do with it

compare","start":707.96,"duration":4.32},{"text":"them using the Euclidean distance","start":710.03,"duration":4.71},{"text":"so we define this nice little Euclidean","start":712.28,"duration":5.34},{"text":"distance function and then we add a new","start":714.74,"duration":4.8},{"text":"layer it's called a lambda layer

two","start":734.51,"duration":3.27},{"text":"networks that we've defined it just","start":735.68,"duration":3.51},{"text":"knows that really what I want is the","start":737.78,"duration":3.06},{"text":"outputs of these two networks to be","start":739.19,"duration":4.02},{"text":"similar right so the more similar the","start":740.84,"duration":4.53},{"text":"outputs of my two networks are the more","start":743.21,"duration":3.45},{"text":"likely the model thinks that the two","start":745.37,"duration":2.76},{"text":"inputs are the same of course buying the","start":746.66,"duration":3.75},{"text":"same number so let's run this this","start":748.13,"duration":4.35},{"text":"network and we can compile it and look","start":750.41,"duration":4.32},{"text":"at it I'm just like we did before and

that","start":756.38,"duration":3.75},{"text":"last big dense layer to figure things","start":757.61,"duration":6.9},{"text":"out and then when you run this

already","start":766.22,"duration":5.4},{"text":"seeing accuracy above 70% so by taking","start":767.87,"duration":5.67},{"text":"out some of the complexity and

a","start":285.81,"duration":4.89},{"text":"perceptron so as usual we're gonna first","start":288.27,"duration":4.44},{"text":"call flatten to kind of remove all

that","start":475.389,"duration":3.0},{"text":"we've learned in different domains and","start":476.919,"duration":3.271},{"text":"applied it this toy different domain and","start":478.389,"duration":3.661},{"text":"the same intuition that we had that you","start":480.19,"duration":3.029},{"text":"know convolutions might work better","start":482.05,"duration":3.45},{"text":"actually turns out to be the case and","start":483.219,"duration":5.641},{"text":"you might think well if one convolution","start":485.5,"duration":5.779},{"text":"works well what about two convolutions","start":488.86,"duration":5.79},{"text":"so we can take this same thing that we","start":491.279,"duration":6.07},{"text":"did before and take a convolution and a","start":494.65,"duration":4.829},{"text":"pooling and then a second convolution in","start":497.349,"duration":9.56},{"text":"a pooling build this model here","start":499.479,"duration":10.461},{"text":"compile it","start":506.909,"duration":3.031},{"text":"and actually we could

model","start":553.5,"duration":4.23},{"text":"which is awesome it's like you know","start":555.75,"duration":4.53},{"text":"maybe a 94% accuracy versus a 93%","start":557.73,"duration":4.41},{"text":"accuracy but you know another thing is","start":560.28,"duration":4.32},{"text":"pretty glaring which is that this is the","start":562.14,"duration":4.53},{"text":"test accuracy and on the training data","start":564.6,"duration":3.99},{"text":"both the one convolution and the two","start":566.67,"duration":3.66},{"text":"convolution model have 100% accuracy","start":568.59,"duration":3.6},{"text":"right so you know it seems like we have","start":570.33,"duration":4.38},{"text":"an issue with overfitting and again we","start":572.19,"duration":4.02},{"text":"can apply all the intuitions that we","start":574.71,"duration":5.22},{"text":"learned on text and image data to this","start":576.21,"duration":5.25},{"text":"problem right and so the the clear thing","start":579.93,"duration":2.85},{"text":"to do when you see this the first thing","start":581.46,"duration":3.99},{"text":"to try is to add some dropout so let's","start":582.78,"duration":5.76},{"text":"put a little bit of dropout in our model","start":585.45,"duration":4.41},{"text":"if you put it in the same place that we","start":588.54,"duration":3.89},{"text":"did before so we can see model add","start":589.86,"duration":9.84},{"text":"dropout maybe dropout 1\/4 the stuff and","start":592.43,"duration":12.28},{"text":"drop it across the stuff again compile","start":599.7,"duration":8.69},{"text":"the model and run fit","start":604.71,"duration":3.68},{"text":"and you

it","start":623.9,"duration":5.88},{"text":"actually kind of continues to improve","start":628.43,"duration":3.69},{"text":"and the same thing happens on the test","start":629.78,"duration":4.5},{"text":"data right so it starts off a little bit","start":632.12,"duration":5.1},{"text":"worse but as it runs over time it gets","start":634.28,"duration":4.41},{"text":"better and better and better right so","start":637.22,"duration":3.48},{"text":"this dropout actually allows the model","start":638.69,"duration":4.17},{"text":"to fit the data even a little bit better","start":640.7,"duration":4.02},{"text":"than without the dropouts so all the","start":642.86,"duration":3.42},{"text":"things that we expect all the theory and","start":644.72,"duration":2.94},{"text":"intuitions that we've learned so far","start":646.28,"duration":3.54},{"text":"they apply it to audio equally as well","start":647.66,"duration":4.47},{"text":"as images or that I just think it's","start":649.82,"duration":5.37},{"text":"super cool maybe let that run a little","start":652.13,"duration":6.66},{"text":"bit then there's one more thing that you","start":655.19,"duration":5.61},{"text":"can try which we did on text which is we","start":658.79,"duration":4.41},{"text":"could take L STM's or gr use and apply","start":660.8,"duration":4.23},{"text":"it to audio right and this might make","start":663.2,"duration":4.35},{"text":"sense especially if we had

think","start":669.59,"duration":2.76},{"text":"actually CN NS probably make a little","start":670.85,"duration":3.42},{"text":"more sense for these tiny files where","start":672.35,"duration":4.77},{"text":"they run well but let's take a peek and","start":674.27,"duration":4.53},{"text":"see how they do so we can copy the code","start":677.12,"duration":5.84},{"text":"from our LS TM video","start":678.8,"duration":4.16},{"text":"and so when we copy the code and you see","start":724.23,"duration":4.149},{"text":"that actually we get an error and it's a","start":726.459,"duration":4.23},{"text":"it's a shaper and it's because LS TM","start":728.379,"duration":4.64},{"text":"expects a two-dimensional but not a","start":730.689,"duration":4.531},{"text":"three-dimensional input and so you get","start":733.019,"duration":3.79},{"text":"the scary error message in this case","start":735.22,"duration":2.76},{"text":"there remember we actually added the","start":736.809,"duration":4.411},{"text":"channel variable later so we could do a","start":737.98,"duration":5.699},{"text":"more complicated reshape but I think the","start":741.22,"duration":6.719},{"text":"simplest thing to do is just undo the","start":743.679,"duration":13.59},{"text":"reshaping that we did before and then we","start":747.939,"duration":18.84},{"text":"can try the lsdm now the

be","start":768.489,"duration":4.5},{"text":"because we had a small STM it also could","start":770.589,"duration":4.83},{"text":"be the fact that our data is actually","start":772.989,"duration":4.26},{"text":"not very long and I think L STM's would","start":775.419,"duration":4.29},{"text":"matter more as the data gets much longer","start":777.249,"duration":4.59},{"text":"so we could spend some time really doing","start":779.709,"duration":4.11},{"text":"hyper parameter tuning and maybe

just","start":381.839,"duration":3.0},{"text":"prevent you from having to put all your","start":383.49,"duration":3.03},{"text":"images in memory and I'll tell you when","start":384.839,"duration":3.241},{"text":"you work on real-world data sets that","start":386.52,"duration":3.239},{"text":"becomes a big issue so in

why","start":430.75,"duration":7.77},{"text":"don't we why don't we also add that and","start":432.85,"duration":7.98},{"text":"now we call data and dot fit on X train","start":438.52,"duration":3.93},{"text":"and actually what this does is it","start":440.83,"duration":3.99},{"text":"attaches the data generator to the

the","start":204.12,"duration":3.57},{"text":"learning rate to point zero zero one","start":205.95,"duration":3.3},{"text":"right so let's see what happens if we","start":207.69,"duration":6.17},{"text":"set it to point zero zero zero one","start":209.25,"duration":4.61},{"text":"okay so here the blue line is the","start":220.11,"duration":5.14},{"text":"accuracy of the CNN with the lower","start":223.45,"duration":4.05},{"text":"learning rate and the orange line is the","start":225.25,"duration":5.04},{"text":"accuracy of CNN with the default","start":227.5,"duration":4.32},{"text":"learning rate and so you can see lower","start":230.29,"duration":3.27},{"text":"learning rate nothing really bad happens","start":231.82,"duration":3.45},{"text":"but it learns slower and that can be","start":233.56,"duration":3.18},{"text":"really annoying when you're training","start":235.27,"duration":4.8},{"text":"lots of models right so when I see this","start":236.74,"duration":5.37},{"text":"this blue line it's it's consistently","start":240.07,"duration":3.69},{"text":"below the orange line although I think","start":242.11,"duration":5.55},{"text":"that'll probably catch up over time okay","start":243.76,"duration":5.37},{"text":"so suppose you look at this and you say","start":247.66,"duration":3.45},{"text":"you know what learning rate of point","start":249.13,"duration":4.5},{"text":"zero zero zero one that doesn't work as","start":251.11,"duration":4.26},{"text":"well as the default point zero zero one","start":253.63,"duration":3.69},{"text":"let's you know let's raise it up by a","start":255.37,"duration":4.14},{"text":"few factors let's make it say point one","start":257.32,"duration":3.96},{"text":"this would be considered a pretty high","start":259.51,"duration":3.03},{"text":"learning rate but you know who knows","start":261.28,"duration":5.67},{"text":"maybe the model will learn faster so","start":262.54,"duration":6.3},{"text":"here we call model def it and look at","start":266.95,"duration":4.17},{"text":"that we see an accuracy of about 10% and","start":268.84,"duration":3.78},{"text":"it's not even getting better","start":271.12,"duration":4.049},{"text":"another real telltale sign is there are","start":272.62,"duration":5.13},{"text":"losses 14 now remember our losses kind","start":275.169,"duration":4.141},{"text":"of in log space really it's like log","start":277.75,"duration":3.33},{"text":"loss so if you see a loss that's you","start":279.31,"duration":4.14},{"text":"know above 4 or 5 you should think of","start":281.08,"duration":4.29},{"text":"that as a massively huge loss right I","start":283.45,"duration":3.42},{"text":"think like what's actually happening","start":285.37,"duration":3.15},{"text":"here is that the models returning like","start":286.87,"duration":3.99},{"text":"Nan's and infinities and and just crazy","start":288.52,"duration":4.26},{"text":"things right and so this model is never","start":290.86,"duration":4.23},{"text":"gonna get better it just sits at a loss","start":292.78,"duration":6.12},{"text":"of 14 and accuracy of 10 percent and you","start":295.09,"duration":5.25},{"text":"remember we have 10 classes so an","start":298.9,"duration":3.24},{"text":"accuracy of 10 percent is really the","start":300.34,"duration":3.69},{"text":"models just guessing right so this is","start":302.14,"duration":3.029},{"text":"what happens when you said learning rate","start":304.03,"duration":3.449},{"text":"too high you get in a really really bad","start":305.169,"duration":4.621},{"text":"place so lower learning rates tend to be","start":307.479,"duration":4.801},{"text":"safer than higher learning rates what","start":309.79,"duration":5.28},{"text":"about back size so you know our default","start":312.28,"duration":4.8},{"text":"batchat is 32 what happens if we set it","start":315.07,"duration":4.74},{"text":"to say 128 right so there's a 4x","start":317.08,"duration":5.82},{"text":"increase in batch size if we call model","start":319.81,"duration":4.35},{"text":"that fit the first thing you'll notice","start":322.9,"duration":2.82},{"text":"is that it takes a little bit longer to","start":324.16,"duration":3.48},{"text":"start because it's loading more into","start":325.72,"duration":3.63},{"text":"memory but then actually it runs a lot","start":327.64,"duration":4.56},{"text":"faster and so that's actually pretty","start":329.35,"duration":5.1},{"text":"nice but you know if it runs faster and","start":332.2,"duration":4.23},{"text":"we sacrifice accuracy that's not very","start":334.45,"duration":3.27},{"text":"interesting and remember it's running","start":336.43,"duration":2.7},{"text":"faster because each step that it's","start":337.72,"duration":3.81},{"text":"taking is over bigger chunk so it's","start":339.13,"duration":3.93},{"text":"looking at the same number of training","start":341.53,"duration":3.449},{"text":"examples but it's doing it in larger","start":343.06,"duration":3.95},{"text":"chunks","start":344.979,"duration":2.031},{"text":"you","start":353.32,"duration":2.06},{"text":"all right cool so so here I mean this is","start":388.15,"duration":6.51},{"text":"a reason that people often use don't use","start":392.59,"duration":5.01},{"text":"larger batch sizes the CNN with the 128","start":394.66,"duration":5.64},{"text":"batch size is the each step is faster","start":397.6,"duration":4.5},{"text":"but it's actually performing worse than","start":400.3,"duration":4.23},{"text":"the CNN with the smaller batch size but","start":402.1,"duration":3.66},{"text":"there's actually a subtle point there","start":404.53,"duration":2.52},{"text":"that it's important to know which is","start":405.76,"duration":3.42},{"text":"that as you increase the batch size you","start":407.05,"duration":3.75},{"text":"should also include increase the","start":409.18,"duration":3.959},{"text":"learning rate so if you multiply the","start":410.8,"duration":4.89},{"text":"batch size by four you should also","start":413.139,"duration":4.621},{"text":"generally speaking and multiply the","start":415.69,"duration":3.96},{"text":"learning rate by four so with bigger","start":417.76,"duration":3.57},{"text":"batches because you're averaging over","start":419.65,"duration":4.079},{"text":"larger number samples you can get away","start":421.33,"duration":4.14},{"text":"with higher learning rates than you","start":423.729,"duration":4.621},{"text":"otherwise could so let's try this 128","start":425.47,"duration":5.46},{"text":"batch size again but with the 4x","start":428.35,"duration":5.43},{"text":"learning rate versus the baseline","start":430.93,"duration":5.959},{"text":"thirty-two batch size","start":433.78,"duration":3.109},{"text":"you","start":443.009,"duration":2.06},{"text":"okay so actually what you see here is","start":464.889,"duration":3.631},{"text":"that when we Forex the learning rate","start":466.81,"duration":3.569},{"text":"with the larger batch size now we get","start":468.52,"duration":4.139},{"text":"the best of both worlds so we have a CNN","start":470.379,"duration":4.59},{"text":"that's training faster and it's training","start":472.659,"duration":4.681},{"text":"at about the same level of accuracy and","start":474.969,"duration":5.79},{"text":"validation accuracy as our baseline CNN","start":477.34,"duration":5.97},{"text":"so one more fancy thing you can do and","start":480.759,"duration":4.56},{"text":"especially this is really effective when","start":483.31,"duration":4.169},{"text":"you train over a large number of epochs","start":485.319,"duration":4.201},{"text":"is you can reduce the learning rate on","start":487.479,"duration":4.861},{"text":"plateau so the idea here is that once","start":489.52,"duration":4.47},{"text":"your model kind of gets stuck and can't","start":492.34,"duration":3.87},{"text":"find a better optimum it lowers the","start":493.99,"duration":3.479},{"text":"learning rate so it can kind of","start":496.21,"duration":3.989},{"text":"fine-tune in the area that it's in right","start":497.469,"duration":4.29},{"text":"so there's actually this is such a","start":500.199,"duration":3.15},{"text":"common technique that there's actually a","start":501.759,"duration":3.96},{"text":"Carus callback that we can just use it","start":503.349,"duration":4.981},{"text":"will do it for us it has lots of options","start":505.719,"duration":4.26},{"text":"but you know the defaults as usual are","start":508.33,"duration":4.23},{"text":"pretty sensible so we just add to our","start":509.979,"duration":7.011},{"text":"callbacks a callback reduce LR on","start":512.56,"duration":7.83},{"text":"plateau and now in order to get this","start":516.99,"duration":5.62},{"text":"effect we actually have to have our","start":520.39,"duration":4.319},{"text":"learning actually plateaus so let's set","start":522.61,"duration":8.4},{"text":"the epochs to say 300 and time-lapses a","start":524.709,"duration":8.701},{"text":"little bit to not make a really long","start":531.01,"duration":4.55},{"text":"video","start":533.41,"duration":2.15},{"text":"okay and so this model has been training","start":537.89,"duration":4.11},{"text":"for a while and you can see what","start":540.769,"duration":5.13},{"text":"happened is at about the 35th epic it","start":542.0,"duration":7.07},{"text":"stopped improving and so our

can","start":551.18,"duration":4.11},{"text":"see that the accuracy and the validation","start":552.38,"duration":5.55},{"text":"accuracy actually popped up quickly and","start":555.29,"duration":4.979},{"text":"then petered out and with a lot of","start":557.93,"duration":3.899},{"text":"models you actually see that effect","start":560.269,"duration":3.81},{"text":"happen a few times each probably like a","start":561.829,"duration":5.101},{"text":"little bit smaller than the time

of","start":206.799,"duration":3.36},{"text":"at around the end of 2012 right","start":208.319,"duration":4.64},{"text":"so you're like the types of surfaces you","start":210.159,"duration":3.681},{"text":"have the types of things you're","start":212.959,"duration":3.041},{"text":"predicting starts to increase","start":213.84,"duration":4.0},{"text":"and so you know the first dilemma that i","start":216.0,"duration":3.28},{"text":"that i had was like oh i looked at what","start":217.84,"duration":2.88},{"text":"were we doing right and we were","start":219.28,"duration":3.92},{"text":"you know we were using um we were using","start":220.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"the soyuz","start":223.2,"duration":3.119},{"text":"in a way you know like like to go to the","start":224.0,"duration":3.28},{"text":"space station","start":226.319,"duration":2.64},{"text":"nothing fancy just like the good old so","start":227.28,"duration":3.679},{"text":"use right uh","start":228.959,"duration":4.64},{"text":"we were using um uh gradient boosted","start":230.959,"duration":4.161},{"text":"decision trees","start":233.599,"duration":3.681},{"text":"as feature transformers uh mostly you","start":235.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"could think about it that way","start":237.28,"duration":4.239},{"text":"and then we were using uh online uh","start":238.48,"duration":6.16},{"text":"logistic regression you know uh sort of","start":241.519,"duration":5.28},{"text":"after that like cascaded with it right","start":244.64,"duration":4.0},{"text":"so what would you sorry to interrupt but","start":246.799,"duration":3.761},{"text":"what then would you train the","start":248.64,"duration":4.239},{"text":"intermediate gradient boosted tree on","start":250.56,"duration":3.12},{"text":"what would be the kind of thing that","start":252.879,"duration":2.64},{"text":"that would try to predict","start":253.68,"duration":4.0},{"text":"you'd still train them on on the event","start":255.519,"duration":3.44},{"text":"on the binary event that you're trying","start":257.68,"duration":2.799},{"text":"to predict right like like clicks or","start":258.959,"duration":3.12},{"text":"conversions or or whatever","start":260.479,"duration":3.601},{"text":"but obviously you you'd benefit from the","start":262.079,"duration":4.161},{"text":"uh from the robustness that","start":264.08,"duration":4.24},{"text":"that that gives you right like you don't","start":266.24,"duration":3.679},{"text":"have to worry too much about like","start":268.32,"duration":3.599},{"text":"scaling and translation and whatever of","start":269.919,"duration":3.84},{"text":"your but then you would","start":271.919,"duration":4.641},{"text":"you would feed them into a simpler model","start":273.759,"duration":4.0},{"text":"so however yeah","start":276.56,"duration":3.44},{"text":"what what you would then use is um the","start":277.759,"duration":3.281},{"text":"trees themselves","start":280.0,"duration":3.68},{"text":"every tree as a as a categorical feature","start":281.04,"duration":3.599},{"text":"as it were","start":283.68,"duration":4.16},{"text":"and and so then your logistic regression","start":284.639,"duration":4.56},{"text":"model which which would be training","start":287.84,"duration":3.359},{"text":"online has a bunch of inputs that are","start":289.199,"duration":3.361},{"text":"categorical which are like the the","start":291.199,"duration":2.241},{"text":"output such","start":292.56,"duration":1.919},{"text":"each of the trees right so it's","start":293.44,"duration":2.72},{"text":"basically like relearning kind of","start":294.479,"duration":2.881},{"text":"relearning the weights as","start":296.16,"duration":2.479},{"text":"associated with this leaf","start":297.36,"duration":3.6},{"text":"oh interesting wow i have not heard of","start":298.639,"duration":3.761},{"text":"that so the the thing that's changing","start":300.96,"duration":1.84},{"text":"then","start":302.4,"duration":2.4},{"text":"is the sort of the combination of the","start":302.8,"duration":4.16},{"text":"two you train a gradient boosted tree","start":304.8,"duration":4.08},{"text":"then you pull the trees apart and then","start":306.96,"duration":3.28},{"text":"you relearn the","start":308.88,"duration":3.599},{"text":"the weights of each tree yeah and the","start":310.24,"duration":3.2},{"text":"combination yeah","start":312.479,"duration":2.321},{"text":"it's it's a it's a hack right like it's","start":313.44,"duration":3.039},{"text":"not a fully backpropagated model right","start":314.8,"duration":2.32},{"text":"because","start":316.479,"duration":3.201},{"text":"because you train your trees every few","start":317.12,"duration":3.76},{"text":"weeks you know like whenever","start":319.68,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you know um and then and then you have","start":320.88,"duration":3.36},{"text":"logistic regression","start":323.12,"duration":4.16},{"text":"that you know um takes as inputs both","start":324.24,"duration":5.04},{"text":"you know like the the binary indicators","start":327.28,"duration":3.6},{"text":"right like every one of the trees you","start":329.28,"duration":2.8},{"text":"train like hundreds maybe a couple of","start":330.88,"duration":2.879},{"text":"thousand you know trees","start":332.08,"duration":3.28},{"text":"so you have like and each other trees","start":333.759,"duration":4.401},{"text":"has like a dozen leaves or like whatever","start":335.36,"duration":4.72},{"text":"and so and you treat those as like uh","start":338.16,"duration":3.36},{"text":"you know one out of 12","start":340.08,"duration":3.04},{"text":"kind of like encoding but then you're","start":341.52,"duration":3.2},{"text":"learning a weight for each of those","start":343.12,"duration":3.28},{"text":"and you're kind of like learning that's","start":344.72,"duration":3.12},{"text":"like in real time and then you have","start":346.4,"duration":2.32},{"text":"other","start":347.84,"duration":3.76},{"text":"other uh features that you know that go","start":348.72,"duration":4.8},{"text":"in side by side that can actually be","start":351.6,"duration":5.439},{"text":"sort of continuous features as well cool","start":353.52,"duration":4.799},{"text":"so that's the setup that's what i found","start":357.039,"duration":3.041},{"text":"when i got there and so the","start":358.319,"duration":3.041},{"text":"the key decision since you wanted to","start":360.08,"duration":3.119},{"text":"talk about like building up lighting l","start":361.36,"duration":3.48},{"text":"and all that","start":363.199,"duration":4.0},{"text":"was the dilemma","start":364.84,"duration":4.28},{"text":"was the following it was like okay well","start":367.199,"duration":4.081},{"text":"this thing is begging you know","start":369.12,"duration":5.12},{"text":"for a proper neural net right to to to","start":371.28,"duration":4.56},{"text":"be thrown at it right like","start":374.24,"duration":3.2},{"text":"it's almost like we've handcrafted a","start":375.84,"duration":3.52},{"text":"frankenstein you know type of neural net","start":377.44,"duration":3.199},{"text":"by by having","start":379.36,"duration":4.32},{"text":"you know like these trees","start":380.639,"duration":4.721},{"text":"you know with logistic regression","start":383.68,"duration":3.6},{"text":"concatenated to it but like we're not","start":385.36,"duration":3.36},{"text":"even like training it together right","start":387.28,"duration":2.08},{"text":"like we","start":388.72,"duration":3.039},{"text":"we first train the trees and we kind of","start":389.36,"duration":4.08},{"text":"chop the output and then we kind of plug","start":391.759,"duration":3.121},{"text":"this other thing to it and then that's","start":393.44,"duration":2.96},{"text":"the thing that we train","start":394.88,"duration":3.12},{"text":"so it was very obvious that doing that","start":396.4,"duration":3.76},{"text":"you know would probably uh give us","start":398.0,"duration":4.24},{"text":"uh gains this is a two thing this is","start":400.16,"duration":4.319},{"text":"actually it's a 20 2012 is obvious that","start":402.24,"duration":3.2},{"text":"a neural net would","start":404.479,"duration":2.401},{"text":"would give you an improvement i'm trying","start":405.44,"duration":3.84},{"text":"to remember sort of was that obvious to","start":406.88,"duration":3.12},{"text":"everyone","start":409.28,"duration":4.08},{"text":"no no because if you think about the","start":410.0,"duration":6.08},{"text":"i think it was a rus ru sala cudinov and","start":413.36,"duration":4.32},{"text":"jeff hinton and i might be forgetting","start":416.08,"duration":3.28},{"text":"some co-authors so i deeply apologize","start":417.68,"duration":3.2},{"text":"because i've had a","start":419.36,"duration":4.48},{"text":"long day already um apologies but this","start":420.88,"duration":5.12},{"text":"was like the big image net paper","start":423.84,"duration":4.799},{"text":"right was with convenience was i think","start":426.0,"duration":4.96},{"text":"from 2012 if i'm not mistaken","start":428.639,"duration":4.161},{"text":"that sounds right yeah yeah so i don't","start":430.96,"duration":3.6},{"text":"think i don't think it was clear i think","start":432.8,"duration":3.119},{"text":"this is like the the beginning of the","start":434.56,"duration":2.96},{"text":"hockey stick you know","start":435.919,"duration":3.601},{"text":"but i think it wasn't clear if that had","start":437.52,"duration":3.44},{"text":"been like two years later then it would","start":439.52,"duration":2.399},{"text":"have been obvious right","start":440.96,"duration":2.72},{"text":"right right at the time it wasn't clear","start":441.919,"duration":3.601},{"text":"yet and you know you always need a","start":443.68,"duration":3.2},{"text":"couple of months you know to realize","start":445.52,"duration":2.959},{"text":"that something happened","start":446.88,"duration":4.0},{"text":"so yeah the the thing that i that really","start":448.479,"duration":3.601},{"text":"struck me was that","start":450.88,"duration":4.08},{"text":"the the time it took from doing an","start":452.08,"duration":4.88},{"text":"experiment which a lot of it was really","start":454.96,"duration":2.48},{"text":"like","start":456.96,"duration":1.92},{"text":"feature engineering maybe there were","start":457.44,"duration":3.52},{"text":"some experiments with tuning you know","start":458.88,"duration":3.92},{"text":"you're learning ratios and turn and","start":460.96,"duration":3.12},{"text":"tuning like the architecture of your","start":462.8,"duration":2.959},{"text":"trees and the architecture of your","start":464.08,"duration":3.2},{"text":"i mean logistic regression though there","start":465.759,"duration":3.44},{"text":"isn't a lot of architecture to be tuned","start":467.28,"duration":4.479},{"text":"um with your logistic regression like","start":469.199,"duration":3.761},{"text":"the the time to go from","start":471.759,"duration":2.72},{"text":"someone has an idea and starts to do","start":472.96,"duration":3.519},{"text":"some offline experiments to you actually","start":474.479,"duration":2.72},{"text":"have a","start":476.479,"duration":2.641},{"text":"your your new click prediction or","start":477.199,"duration":3.601},{"text":"conversion prediction model for","start":479.12,"duration":3.12},{"text":"you know mobile or whatever in","start":480.8,"duration":2.56},{"text":"production right and actually like","start":482.24,"duration":3.04},{"text":"materializing those gains","start":483.36,"duration":4.0},{"text":"would be several weeks it'll be like","start":485.28,"duration":4.319},{"text":"sometimes six weeks sometimes two months","start":487.36,"duration":4.32},{"text":"and i thought holy crap that's not","start":489.599,"duration":3.28},{"text":"that's not great right","start":491.68,"duration":2.639},{"text":"and so the crossroads in a way you know","start":492.879,"duration":3.44},{"text":"on the one hand you're like","start":494.319,"duration":4.56},{"text":"okay this thing i have is is simple but","start":496.319,"duration":4.0},{"text":"we're still getting a lot of gains by","start":498.879,"duration":2.16},{"text":"tuning it","start":500.319,"duration":3.121},{"text":"right and on the other hand i can go and","start":501.039,"duration":3.041},{"text":"just like","start":503.44,"duration":2.56},{"text":"replace my soyuz with something like","start":504.08,"duration":3.119},{"text":"sophisticated right","start":506.0,"duration":2.56},{"text":"so that was like the that was like the","start":507.199,"duration":4.321},{"text":"the crossroads um that i","start":508.56,"duration":4.719},{"text":"so do you do you want to know what i","start":511.52,"duration":3.439},{"text":"decided to do tell me","start":513.279,"duration":4.161},{"text":"yes i feel like you're kind of picking","start":514.959,"duration":5.121},{"text":"on this little use i don't i didn't know","start":517.44,"duration":4.56},{"text":"that was the","start":520.08,"duration":5.759},{"text":"metaphor for oh symmetry thing uh","start":522.0,"duration":5.44},{"text":"it's true that the so use well i mean i","start":525.839,"duration":2.801},{"text":"think the series is rudimentary in the","start":527.44,"duration":2.399},{"text":"sense that like the","start":528.64,"duration":3.52},{"text":"the the computer systems that the soyuz","start":529.839,"duration":3.601},{"text":"has in it","start":532.16,"duration":4.4},{"text":"are probably","start":533.44,"duration":4.88},{"text":"50 years old or like i don't know","start":536.56,"duration":3.52},{"text":"something like that right right but","start":538.32,"duration":4.0},{"text":"they work right so so the reason i use","start":540.08,"duration":4.08},{"text":"this to use analogy is more like","start":542.32,"duration":4.079},{"text":"it gets the job done you know it's like","start":544.16,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you know it's a gradient

task","start":557.279,"duration":3.601},{"text":"they'll use either some sort of a","start":559.2,"duration":3.04},{"text":"sequence model","start":560.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"they're using lstm they'll use uh what i","start":562.24,"duration":4.08},{"text":"mean i guess is this a transformer or","start":564.72,"duration":3.119},{"text":"like whatever","start":566.32,"duration":4.4},{"text":"and it's like and sometimes you go like","start":567.839,"duration":4.801},{"text":"did you try like a max ant model did you","start":570.72,"duration":2.64},{"text":"try like a","start":572.64,"duration":2.4},{"text":"like a good old you know bag of words","start":573.36,"duration":3.2},{"text":"with logistic regression","start":575.04,"duration":4.4},{"text":"and the surprising thing is that i would","start":576.56,"duration":4.399},{"text":"say","start":579.44,"duration":4.48},{"text":"between 20 and 50 of the time you get","start":580.959,"duration":4.081},{"text":"the same results","start":583.92,"duration":4.0},{"text":"and and then you're like did you realize","start":585.04,"duration":3.44},{"text":"how much","start":587.92,"duration":2.96},{"text":"cheaper this thing is right in terms of","start":588.48,"duration":3.84},{"text":"anything you care about right whether","start":590.88,"duration":2.0},{"text":"it's like","start":592.32,"duration":2.72},{"text":"training time you know inference time","start":592.88,"duration":3.28},{"text":"whatever right","start":595.04,"duration":3.68},{"text":"so yeah so so basically the big bet","start":596.16,"duration":4.32},{"text":"there was to say well what we need to do","start":598.72,"duration":3.119},{"text":"here is we need to actually","start":600.48,"duration":4.64},{"text":"um allow our teams to","start":601.839,"duration":5.44},{"text":"uh to ship every week and there was like","start":605.12,"duration":3.68},{"text":"the the big model it was like","start":607.279,"duration":3.921},{"text":"ship every week do whatever it takes so","start":608.8,"duration":3.039},{"text":"that","start":611.2,"duration":2.319},{"text":"every week we can ship new models to","start":611.839,"duration":3.12},{"text":"production","start":613.519,"duration":2.801},{"text":"and what that meant was like oh we need","start":614.959,"duration":3.921},{"text":"to dramatically accelerate","start":616.32,"duration":6.4},{"text":"um you know that path from i have a new","start":618.88,"duration":5.36},{"text":"model that i could put in production to","start":622.72,"duration":3.52},{"text":"like it's in production","start":624.24,"duration":3.839},{"text":"and that and that kind of like triggered","start":626.24,"duration":4.56},{"text":"five years of work","start":628.079,"duration":2.721},{"text":"and so what were the keys i mean tell me","start":631.519,"duration":3.841},{"text":"the pieces that you needed to build","start":632.88,"duration":4.16},{"text":"in order to allow that to happen because","start":635.36,"duration":2.719},{"text":"i'm sure a lot of people listening to","start":637.04,"duration":2.4},{"text":"this are thinking i'd like to","start":638.079,"duration":3.361},{"text":"ship a model every week what do you need","start":639.44,"duration":4.0},{"text":"in order to do that safely","start":641.44,"duration":5.6},{"text":"it was many things at different","start":643.44,"duration":6.88},{"text":"at different levels so at a very low","start":647.04,"duration":6.799},{"text":"level it's about fitting in you know","start":650.32,"duration":5.04},{"text":"seamlessly","start":653.839,"duration":3.68},{"text":"in like whatever infrastructure you have","start":655.36,"duration":4.4},{"text":"for for inference right and adopting","start":657.519,"duration":3.921},{"text":"some sort of like standards","start":659.76,"duration":3.519},{"text":"which seems super easy and trivial but","start":661.44,"duration":4.639},{"text":"even that you shouldn't take for granted","start":663.279,"duration":5.041},{"text":"the the part that i thought was even","start":666.079,"duration":3.76},{"text":"more","start":668.32,"duration":3.84},{"text":"interesting is that i think what was","start":669.839,"duration":4.721},{"text":"slowing people down was","start":672.16,"duration":6.08},{"text":"probably two or three things one was","start":674.56,"duration":6.959},{"text":"it was extremely difficult to share work","start":678.24,"duration":5.44},{"text":"between people because people would be","start":681.519,"duration":4.161},{"text":"running experiments in their own","start":683.68,"duration":4.159},{"text":"dev servers and even like having you","start":685.68,"duration":3.279},{"text":"know like","start":687.839,"duration":3.12},{"text":"as we all know like configs aren't or","start":688.959,"duration":4.241},{"text":"back then weren't sort of easily","start":690.959,"duration":4.721},{"text":"portable like it would just take you you","start":693.2,"duration":3.52},{"text":"know i don't know","start":695.68,"duration":2.719},{"text":"like a couple of hours or like you know","start":696.72,"duration":3.04},{"text":"whatever you'd have like an energy","start":698.399,"duration":2.641},{"text":"barrier before i could actually play","start":699.76,"duration":2.24},{"text":"with what you had done","start":701.04,"duration":2.88},{"text":"right the second thing which i think is","start":702.0,"duration":3.04},{"text":"related is that","start":703.92,"duration":2.96},{"text":"you started to have a lot of teams","start":705.04,"duration":3.44},{"text":"reinventing the wheel so a lot of the","start":706.88,"duration":3.12},{"text":"work that was being done was actually","start":708.48,"duration":2.56},{"text":"duplicate","start":710.0,"duration":3.2},{"text":"um because as a number of surfaces on","start":711.04,"duration":3.44},{"text":"which we we","start":713.2,"duration":3.6},{"text":"showed you know ads sort of kept","start":714.48,"duration":3.76},{"text":"increasing and the types of modalities","start":716.8,"duration":2.159},{"text":"kept increasing","start":718.24,"duration":2.08},{"text":"you kind of had like teams that focused","start":718.959,"duration":3.761},{"text":"on like one of those voxels in your in","start":720.32,"duration":2.959},{"text":"your","start":722.72,"duration":3.119},{"text":"you know tensor of of of of","start":723.279,"duration":4.0},{"text":"configurations","start":725.839,"duration":3.041},{"text":"and they wouldn't obviously talk to each","start":727.279,"duration":2.641},{"text":"other or like the work wouldn't be","start":728.88,"duration":2.399},{"text":"discoverable right so","start":729.92,"duration":3.359},{"text":"thing number one was like automate","start":731.279,"duration":3.201},{"text":"everything you have to automate","start":733.279,"duration":1.841},{"text":"everything","start":734.48,"duration":2.56},{"text":"you have to make it ridiculously easy","start":735.12,"duration":4.0},{"text":"and you have to abstract you know","start":737.04,"duration":3.52},{"text":"everything from the engineering trying","start":739.12,"duration":3.04},{"text":"to deploy something right especially","start":740.56,"duration":2.079},{"text":"because","start":742.16,"duration":1.76},{"text":"we're growing very fast and you get a","start":742.639,"duration":2.481},{"text":"lot of people who are joining the","start":743.92,"duration":2.64},{"text":"company fresh from from","start":745.12,"duration":2.959},{"text":"from somewhere maybe they are good","start":746.56,"duration":2.8},{"text":"applied researchers but they're not","start":748.079,"duration":2.801},{"text":"infra people necessarily","start":749.36,"duration":3.52},{"text":"so abstracting and automating you know","start":750.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"super important the second","start":752.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"shareability right like make sure that","start":754.72,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you abstract and encapsulate things in a","start":756.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"way where they're like super easy to","start":758.56,"duration":2.8},{"text":"share so i can see","start":760.0,"duration":3.2},{"text":"what input features are working for you","start":761.36,"duration":2.96},{"text":"you know if you're working on like","start":763.2,"duration":3.199},{"text":"conversion prediction models for","start":764.32,"duration":4.56},{"text":"in-game ads or like whatever you know i","start":766.399,"duration":3.44},{"text":"can super easily","start":768.88,"duration":3.68},{"text":"see that obviously you have infra work","start":769.839,"duration":4.56},{"text":"again right like because","start":772.56,"duration":3.76},{"text":"you know the way we we store and","start":774.399,"duration":3.68},{"text":"represent data is very heterogeneous so","start":776.32,"duration":2.88},{"text":"there's like it's a pain in the butt","start":778.079,"duration":2.401},{"text":"usually to","start":779.2,"duration":2.4},{"text":"even if you're only looking at like","start":780.48,"duration":2.96},{"text":"reproducing training you know depending","start":781.6,"duration":3.28},{"text":"on like what your setup is that's like","start":783.44,"duration":3.92},{"text":"work but then going you know obviously","start":784.88,"duration":3.12},{"text":"the way","start":787.36,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you run your data pipelines when you're","start":788.0,"duration":4.16},{"text":"training offline","start":790.8,"duration":2.56},{"text":"versus when you're trying to serve in","start":792.16,"duration":3.52},{"text":"real time you know is is different","start":793.36,"duration":5.279},{"text":"almost always and and obviously you know","start":795.68,"duration":4.56},{"text":"when when you're online you're on a","start":798.639,"duration":3.281},{"text":"budget so you want to make as few calls","start":800.24,"duration":3.44},{"text":"as possible when you're serving so you","start":801.92,"duration":3.12},{"text":"gotta you gotta sort of figure out how","start":803.68,"duration":2.8},{"text":"to abstract those things and","start":805.04,"duration":4.08},{"text":"again like hide all complexity and then","start":806.48,"duration":4.08},{"text":"the third one which i think is really","start":809.12,"duration":2.719},{"text":"really interesting is really like think","start":810.56,"duration":3.519},{"text":"about collaboration by design right like","start":811.839,"duration":4.401},{"text":"how can you build an environment where i","start":814.079,"duration":4.081},{"text":"go in and i can see every single","start":816.24,"duration":3.76},{"text":"experiment anyone has run","start":818.16,"duration":3.919},{"text":"and i can go and by clicking i can see","start":820.0,"duration":3.519},{"text":"first of all who they are who they are","start":822.079,"duration":2.801},{"text":"is huge right","start":823.519,"duration":2.88},{"text":"because then i know who to ask","start":824.88,"duration":2.8},{"text":"especially if i'm new to the company and","start":826.399,"duration":2.721},{"text":"you have a company that's growing fast","start":827.68,"duration":2.64},{"text":"right","start":829.12,"duration":3.279},{"text":"so the the equivalent of your git blame","start":830.32,"duration":3.04},{"text":"or or whatever","start":832.399,"duration":2.24},{"text":"is super important that you need to know","start":833.36,"duration":3.12},{"text":"who people are","start":834.639,"duration":4.161},{"text":"the second one again is like so much is","start":836.48,"duration":3.359},{"text":"um wasted","start":838.8,"duration":2.8},{"text":"in terms of replicating experiments that","start":839.839,"duration":3.521},{"text":"someone has already done so like book","start":841.6,"duration":2.64},{"text":"keeping you know","start":843.36,"duration":3.039},{"text":"is extremely important and then the","start":844.24,"duration":3.839},{"text":"ability to just like beg borrow and","start":846.399,"duration":2.24},{"text":"steal","start":848.079,"duration":2.32},{"text":"you know bits of pieces either of like","start":848.639,"duration":3.121},{"text":"feature competitions or like","start":850.399,"duration":3.361},{"text":"like models you know we were like","start":851.76,"duration":3.68},{"text":"exposing learning curves and things like","start":853.76,"duration":3.04},{"text":"that as well so you can actually sort of","start":855.44,"duration":2.88},{"text":"browse them and","start":856.8,"duration":2.96},{"text":"and then another component and i'm not","start":858.32,"duration":2.72},{"text":"being super organized here i think i've","start":859.76,"duration":2.639},{"text":"said it's three things and i might like","start":861.04,"duration":2.799},{"text":"the fifth thing already but like","start":862.399,"duration":3.921},{"text":"another one is like try to be as modular","start":863.839,"duration":3.521},{"text":"you know","start":866.32,"duration":4.079},{"text":"as possible right and and if possible as","start":867.36,"duration":4.64},{"text":"well like language agnostic","start":870.399,"duration":3.841},{"text":"and separate out you know separate out","start":872.0,"duration":3.76},{"text":"like the language","start":874.24,"duration":4.0},{"text":"uh or the you know platform that you're","start":875.76,"duration":4.639},{"text":"using to kind of specify whatever models","start":878.24,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you're building","start":880.399,"duration":4.0},{"text":"from the the definition of a workflow","start":881.68,"duration":4.24},{"text":"and the execution of our workflow so","start":884.399,"duration":3.041},{"text":"really really abstracting that away","start":885.92,"duration":2.88},{"text":"right and sort of thinking about","start":887.44,"duration":3.519},{"text":"okay an ml workflow is an ml workflow","start":888.8,"duration":3.2},{"text":"and i don't care","start":890.959,"duration":2.88},{"text":"you know if you're specifying your","start":892.0,"duration":3.04},{"text":"models in","start":893.839,"duration":4.721},{"text":"matlab octave python by torch you know","start":895.04,"duration":6.159},{"text":"tensorflow like whatever it is that","start":898.56,"duration":3.6},{"text":"you're doing","start":901.199,"duration":2.481},{"text":"a lot of the bread and butter that","start":902.16,"duration":3.039},{"text":"you're doing","start":903.68,"duration":3.36},{"text":"is kind of common right so really layer","start":905.199,"duration":3.2},{"text":"it modularize it","start":907.04,"duration":4.159},{"text":"um was was sort of huge you know it's","start":908.399,"duration":4.321},{"text":"interesting i feel like the things that","start":911.199,"duration":2.401},{"text":"you're saying","start":912.72,"duration":4.16},{"text":"are the things that all ml leaders want","start":913.6,"duration":5.039},{"text":"that i talk to but i think the place","start":916.88,"duration":3.759},{"text":"that they get tripped up i mean","start":918.639,"duration":3.521},{"text":"all the benefits that you're saying","start":920.639,"duration":3.361},{"text":"totally makes sense but i think the","start":922.16,"duration":3.679},{"text":"sort of downside is that it requires","start":924.0,"duration":3.6},{"text":"getting everyone's buy-in into kind of a","start":925.839,"duration":2.641},{"text":"standard","start":927.6,"duration":3.039},{"text":"way of doing things and i'm curious how","start":928.48,"duration":3.359},{"text":"you got that because","start":930.639,"duration":3.2},{"text":"you know ml practitioners are so hard to","start":931.839,"duration":3.68},{"text":"hire and they're often opinionated and","start":933.839,"duration":2.8},{"text":"working different parts of the org","start":935.519,"duration":2.88},{"text":"how did you get them all to buy into the","start":936.639,"duration":3.44},{"text":"same of an opinion you","start":938.399,"duration":3.301},{"text":"often open opinionated you say","start":940.079,"duration":4.081},{"text":"[Laughter]","start":941.7,"duration":5.1},{"text":"i would like to meet one that is not","start":944.16,"duration":3.52},{"text":"opinionated","start":946.8,"duration":3.92},{"text":"um sometimes not opinionated","start":947.68,"duration":6.079},{"text":"um yeah it's tricky right and this is","start":950.72,"duration":3.52},{"text":"actually","start":953.759,"duration":2.241},{"text":"so you're you're putting the finger on","start":954.24,"duration":3.839},{"text":"on a on an amazing point which is really","start":956.0,"duration":2.56},{"text":"uh","start":958.079,"duration":3.44},{"text":"uh almost like a change management right","start":958.56,"duration":3.279},{"text":"uh","start":961.519,"duration":2.32},{"text":"very very hard several reasons why it's","start":961.839,"duration":4.721},{"text":"hard you know reason number one","start":963.839,"duration":4.961},{"text":"in any in any fast-moving company where","start":966.56,"duration":4.079},{"text":"you have low-hanging fruit","start":968.8,"duration":3.599},{"text":"i mean this is not unique to a male","start":970.639,"duration":3.44},{"text":"right who's gonna actually pause and do","start":972.399,"duration":3.201},{"text":"and clean up the kitchen right and and","start":974.079,"duration":3.361},{"text":"like pay back some tech depth or","start":975.6,"duration":3.28},{"text":"or like build interest or you move","start":977.44,"duration":3.36},{"text":"faster it's like you're almost like hey","start":978.88,"duration":3.68},{"text":"why don't you do it you know like","start":980.8,"duration":3.839},{"text":"i i don't feel like doing it myself","start":982.56,"duration":3.6},{"text":"right um","start":984.639,"duration":4.401},{"text":"so that's like one one uh challenge the","start":986.16,"duration":4.16},{"text":"other one of course is a","start":989.04,"duration":3.76},{"text":"is a sense of of pride that people have","start":990.32,"duration":3.759},{"text":"right i mean and especially","start":992.8,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you know i used to be in academia and in","start":994.079,"duration":3.921},{"text":"academia","start":996.24,"duration":4.32},{"text":"the thing that determines your worth is","start":998.0,"duration":3.759},{"text":"almost like uh","start":1000.56,"duration":2.88},{"text":"the praise you get for the work that you","start":1001.759,"duration":3.841},{"text":"do but you put your name","start":1003.44,"duration":4.639},{"text":"on your papers right so culturally","start":1005.6,"duration":4.0},{"text":"culturally it's tricky right to sort of","start":1008.079,"duration":2.88},{"text":"say and i'm going to surrender some of","start":1009.6,"duration":2.479},{"text":"that right","start":1010.959,"duration":4.32},{"text":"for the greater good so the","start":1012.079,"duration":6.641},{"text":"the tactic that we took one of them","start":1015.279,"duration":4.881},{"text":"was just to be ridiculously laser","start":1018.72,"duration":3.359},{"text":"focused so look the one thing that i","start":1020.16,"duration":3.52},{"text":"should have clarified is i never dreamt","start":1022.079,"duration":2.801},{"text":"that one day i would build","start":1023.68,"duration":2.639},{"text":"the applied machine learning team at","start":1024.88,"duration":2.799},{"text":"facebook that was not the intent you","start":1026.319,"duration":2.561},{"text":"know like i was in ads","start":1027.679,"duration":4.0},{"text":"we were focusing ads but even within ads","start":1028.88,"duration":4.319},{"text":"we already started to have several teams","start":1031.679,"duration":2.961},{"text":"working on several aspects of the","start":1033.199,"duration":2.401},{"text":"problem so","start":1034.64,"duration":2.48},{"text":"at least i you know we worked on","start":1035.6,"duration":3.439},{"text":"generating alignment and a vision within","start":1037.12,"duration":3.439},{"text":"ads and that was not like a million","start":1039.039,"duration":2.561},{"text":"people you know there was just like a","start":1040.559,"duration":2.801},{"text":"couple of dozen people right","start":1041.6,"duration":4.079},{"text":"and we were i think all feeling the pain","start":1043.36,"duration":3.839},{"text":"and the urgency to move fast so","start":1045.679,"duration":4.561},{"text":"it was you know it was semi-obvious that","start":1047.199,"duration":4.321},{"text":"that this was going to be good it was a","start":1050.24,"duration":3.52},{"text":"bald bet so you need to kind of generate","start":1051.52,"duration":3.519},{"text":"alignment both you know","start":1053.76,"duration":3.2},{"text":"on the people who are deploying things","start":1055.039,"duration":3.441},{"text":"and doing experiments every day but also","start":1056.96,"duration":2.64},{"text":"you say get

anything","start":1172.96,"duration":2.56},{"text":"right like you know why would someone","start":1174.0,"duration":3.28},{"text":"want to you know use our tool and","start":1175.52,"duration":3.519},{"text":"i feel like for us a big part of it is","start":1177.28,"duration":3.12},{"text":"like showing little wins to

oh i want that like i want","start":1198.24,"duration":2.96},{"text":"to be able to see the system metrics of","start":1199.6,"duration":2.24},{"text":"my","start":1201.2,"duration":2.719},{"text":"um runs or something like that that got","start":1201.84,"duration":3.76},{"text":"people to use their stuff","start":1203.919,"duration":3.921},{"text":"yeah no excellent excellent question i'm","start":1205.6,"duration":4.0},{"text":"just mining you selfishly for features","start":1207.84,"duration":3.199},{"text":"for a product really","start":1209.6,"duration":3.77},{"text":"that was that was so shameless yeah so","start":1211.039,"duration":3.921},{"text":"[Laughter]","start":1213.37,"duration":4.23},{"text":"so one one big caveat look at that i","start":1214.96,"duration":3.12},{"text":"have to","start":1217.6,"duration":3.04},{"text":"to say of course is that you know when i","start":1218.08,"duration":4.079},{"text":"was very involved with this stuff in the","start":1220.64,"duration":2.56},{"text":"in the early days","start":1222.159,"duration":3.841},{"text":"um there was like already you know uh","start":1223.2,"duration":3.359},{"text":"like","start":1226.0,"duration":3.679},{"text":"eight uh seven and six years ago","start":1226.559,"duration":5.201},{"text":"so so i know that things have changed a","start":1229.679,"duration":4.48},{"text":"lot like i know that you have like open","start":1231.76,"duration":2.799},{"text":"source","start":1234.159,"duration":2.801},{"text":"tools today which if we had had them we","start":1234.559,"duration":3.841},{"text":"would have just used them directly","start":1236.96,"duration":3.12},{"text":"uh including maybe waste and biases","start":1238.4,"duration":3.519},{"text":"products right so your question is if","start":1240.08,"duration":3.2},{"text":"you set aside like the collaboration","start":1241.919,"duration":3.041},{"text":"benefits and all that like just in terms","start":1243.28,"duration":3.56},{"text":"of pure individual contributor you know","start":1244.96,"duration":5.599},{"text":"productivity why would i care","start":1246.84,"duration":5.4},{"text":"i have both news and i have bad news i","start":1250.559,"duration":3.041},{"text":"guess good news","start":1252.24,"duration":2.96},{"text":"i think i think the the bad news maybe","start":1253.6,"duration":3.36},{"text":"is that","start":1255.2,"duration":3.28},{"text":"some of the problems we solved were","start":1256.96,"duration":3.28},{"text":"actually a bit facebook specific","start":1258.48,"duration":3.04},{"text":"so i think that that's not going to be","start":1260.24,"duration":3.439},{"text":"useful to you but like","start":1261.52,"duration":4.32},{"text":"uh in terms of like um you know","start":1263.679,"duration":3.12},{"text":"abstraction","start":1265.84,"duration":3.92},{"text":"right and like just the ability to","start":1266.799,"duration":4.321},{"text":"almost like at the click of a button","start":1269.76,"duration":2.32},{"text":"like the fact that you could actually","start":1271.12,"duration":2.24},{"text":"clone a workflow i'm going to give you","start":1272.08,"duration":3.12},{"text":"an example here's an example","start":1273.36,"duration":5.04},{"text":"so you're the instagram ml team and","start":1275.2,"duration":4.88},{"text":"instagram's never been ranked before","start":1278.4,"duration":3.519},{"text":"like instagram's feed has been shown","start":1280.08,"duration":2.64},{"text":"like in uh","start":1281.919,"duration":3.521},{"text":"decreasing uh in a chronological order","start":1282.72,"duration":3.36},{"text":"right","start":1285.44,"duration":4.08},{"text":"from most recent to to to less recent","start":1286.08,"duration":6.24},{"text":"and you're tasked with like hey design","start":1289.52,"duration":5.519},{"text":"me a ranking system for instagram right","start":1292.32,"duration":4.56},{"text":"that's kind of like a tall order but","start":1295.039,"duration":3.52},{"text":"imagine now that you have an environment","start":1296.88,"duration":2.32},{"text":"where","start":1298.559,"duration":3.281},{"text":"um you can actually just like look at","start":1299.2,"duration":3.839},{"text":"the production system","start":1301.84,"duration":4.24},{"text":"that ranks news feed","start":1303.039,"duration":5.76},{"text":"there's a lot you can borrow there right","start":1306.08,"duration":3.839},{"text":"and so i think just like","start":1308.799,"duration":4.561},{"text":"just like the ability to borrow um","start":1309.919,"duration":5.12},{"text":"uh you know whether it's like the","start":1313.36,"duration":3.04},{"text":"features that seem to be working the","start":1315.039,"duration":3.841},{"text":"best you know the models the sort of a","start":1316.4,"duration":4.56},{"text":"training schedule the hyper parameters","start":1318.88,"duration":4.48},{"text":"all of that is is like a big thing","start":1320.96,"duration":3.599},{"text":"in parallel to that you have like","start":1323.36,"duration":3.679},{"text":"abstractions right like uh again like","start":1324.559,"duration":4.561},{"text":"at facebook i don't even know how many","start":1327.039,"duration":4.241},{"text":"distinct and mutually incompatible you","start":1329.12,"duration":3.039},{"text":"know uh","start":1331.28,"duration":3.6},{"text":"data stores we have uh but you can","start":1332.159,"duration":3.601},{"text":"imagine right","start":1334.88,"duration":2.64},{"text":"so but and the fact that the tool will","start":1335.76,"duration":3.039},{"text":"actually abstract that for you","start":1337.52,"duration":3.84},{"text":"is is very useful um as well then if you","start":1338.799,"duration":4.0},{"text":"have to build a workflow yourself","start":1341.36,"duration":2.72},{"text":"building workflows is a pain","start":1342.799,"duration":2.641},{"text":"right like if you have to do them from","start":1344.08,"duration":2.479},{"text":"if you don't have a tool to build","start":1345.44,"duration":2.719},{"text":"workflows it's just a pain","start":1346.559,"duration":3.441},{"text":"and then another one tools for debugging","start":1348.159,"duration":3.601},{"text":"you know and automation so i'll give you","start":1350.0,"duration":3.52},{"text":"an example of a couple of things two for","start":1351.76,"duration":2.72},{"text":"automation","start":1353.52,"duration":2.96},{"text":"automatic feature selection the fact","start":1354.48,"duration":3.6},{"text":"that the fact that you have a tool that","start":1356.48,"duration":3.36},{"text":"actually scans for every feature you","start":1358.08,"duration":2.8},{"text":"could possibly use","start":1359.84,"duration":2.56},{"text":"and then while you're sleeping it's just","start":1360.88,"duration":2.799},{"text":"making sure that you have maximum","start":1362.4,"duration":2.88},{"text":"machine utilization","start":1363.679,"duration":4.48},{"text":"uh and you're just like doing whatever","start":1365.28,"duration":3.36},{"text":"feature","start":1368.159,"duration":1.681},{"text":"selection algorithm you want i don't","start":1368.64,"duration":2.64},{"text":"care doesn't matter but it's just doing","start":1369.84,"duration":2.4},{"text":"work for you","start":1371.28,"duration":2.96},{"text":"uh including you doing the plan so true","start":1372.24,"duration":3.6},{"text":"stories is ads engineers would come in","start":1374.24,"duration":2.72},{"text":"the morning on monday","start":1375.84,"duration":3.6},{"text":"and they would see like proposals for","start":1376.96,"duration":3.92},{"text":"new models and you're like oh this looks","start":1379.44,"duration":2.8},{"text":"good like i get a couple of","start":1380.88,"duration":4.72},{"text":"you know 0.1 whatever percent points of","start":1382.24,"duration":4.559},{"text":"gain in like water metric and that's","start":1385.6,"duration":2.079},{"text":"good","start":1386.799,"duration":5.041},{"text":"the other one is one very simple reason","start":1387.679,"duration":6.0},{"text":"ml systems fail is because some data","start":1391.84,"duration":3.839},{"text":"pipeline uh fails right","start":1393.679,"duration":4.48},{"text":"and and again like if you have to be","start":1395.679,"duration":3.041},{"text":"checking","start":1398.159,"duration":2.561},{"text":"ad hoc it's a pain imagine that you have","start":1398.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"like this beautiful","start":1400.72,"duration":2.8},{"text":"dashboard you know with colors and","start":1402.0,"duration":3.2},{"text":"whatever that just tell you what","start":1403.52,"duration":2.8},{"text":"features have","start":1405.2,"duration":3.359},{"text":"uh are not working and in which way are","start":1406.32,"duration":3.76},{"text":"they not working anymore","start":1408.559,"duration":2.881},{"text":"uh you know is it that you have like","start":1410.08,"duration":2.56},{"text":"statistical things like they still","start":1411.44,"duration":3.28},{"text":"produce uh valid values but they're like","start":1412.64,"duration":3.919},{"text":"the same all the time or is it that you","start":1414.72,"duration":3.199},{"text":"get like things that are not a number","start":1416.559,"duration":2.561},{"text":"like what what the hell is going on","start":1417.919,"duration":2.161},{"text":"right","start":1419.12,"duration":2.559},{"text":"that's like super useful as well right","start":1420.08,"duration":3.52},{"text":"or like tools to look at your learning","start":1421.679,"duration":3.201},{"text":"curves and whatever so","start":1423.6,"duration":2.559},{"text":"yeah these are like a bunch of examples","start":1424.88,"duration":3.12},{"text":"of things which like you know if you're","start":1426.159,"duration":4.0},{"text":"an email engineer are you you want that","start":1428.0,"duration":4.08},{"text":"stuff totally that that totally makes","start":1430.159,"duration":2.64},{"text":"sense","start":1432.08,"duration":2.719},{"text":"i want to um make

that","start":1513.36,"duration":2.64},{"text":"because you've worked on that in the","start":1514.72,"duration":2.88},{"text":"past right so you have like

will block things if they if they","start":1618.88,"duration":3.44},{"text":"violate you know uh","start":1620.64,"duration":4.48},{"text":"laws right so if you if you have like uh","start":1622.32,"duration":4.719},{"text":"i don't know like defamation of","start":1625.12,"duration":4.559},{"text":"like public figures you know with

our","start":1641.36,"duration":3.28},{"text":"community standards or like","start":1643.2,"duration":2.8},{"text":"law so that's the action that you're","start":1644.64,"duration":2.96},{"text":"that you're taking with the condition of","start":1646.0,"duration":3.52},{"text":"like humans and ai","start":1647.6,"duration":3.6},{"text":"and so the challenge there again is like","start":1649.52,"duration":3.759},{"text":"uh you know","start":1651.2,"duration":3.68},{"text":"you know if you look at this from like a","start":1653.279,"duration":3.441},{"text":"fairness point of view maybe your","start":1654.88,"duration":3.279},{"text":"definition of fairness is that if we're","start":1656.72,"duration":2.88},{"text":"investing a certain amount of

uh","start":1668.0,"duration":2.96},{"text":"content yeah and then the question there","start":1669.279,"duration":3.28},{"text":"becomes like what what does that mean","start":1670.96,"duration":3.04},{"text":"right because if you think about","start":1672.559,"duration":3.281},{"text":"algorithmic fairness and bias you know","start":1674.0,"duration":3.44},{"text":"if you're thinking about like using ai","start":1675.84,"duration":3.6},{"text":"to recommend jobs to people","start":1677.44,"duration":3.28},{"text":"then you get into like and you're in the","start":1679.44,"duration":2.719},{"text":"us you think about like protected","start":1680.72,"duration":3.12},{"text":"categories you think about gender","start":1682.159,"duration":4.481},{"text":"age you know race or ethnicity and stuff","start":1683.84,"duration":3.839},{"text":"like that right where there's like","start":1686.64,"duration":3.2},{"text":"anti-discrimination laws that exist","start":1687.679,"duration":3.441},{"text":"but if you think about this problem in","start":1689.84,"duration":3.04},{"text":"india you're like oh","start":1691.12,"duration":3.919},{"text":"politically what are the hot areas right","start":1692.88,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and then immediately you know when you","start":1695.039,"duration":2.88},{"text":"work with local people","start":1696.32,"duration":4.32},{"text":"you know it's things like caste or","start":1697.919,"duration":3.601},{"text":"religion","start":1700.64,"duration":3.6},{"text":"but obviously we don't have that data","start":1701.52,"duration":3.759},{"text":"and it's not

the end you do a bunch of work and","start":1709.2,"duration":4.16},{"text":"figure out well what can i do and so","start":1711.52,"duration":4.08},{"text":"we ended up using like language and and","start":1713.36,"duration":3.439},{"text":"region sorry","start":1715.6,"duration":3.6},{"text":"well again if if you had cast and","start":1716.799,"duration":4.401},{"text":"ethnicity i'm sorry i feel like i'm","start":1719.2,"duration":3.76},{"text":"showing my ignorance here but if you had","start":1721.2,"duration":3.199},{"text":"those things what","start":1722.96,"duration":2.88},{"text":"what would you do with that like what","start":1724.399,"duration":2.88},{"text":"what would be the fair thing to do that","start":1725.84,"duration":1.76},{"text":"you're","start":1727.279,"duration":2.081},{"text":"you're trying to do so so the challenge","start":1727.6,"duration":3.12},{"text":"with fairness right and that's where","start":1729.36,"duration":2.799},{"text":"like uh we're gonna go back all the way","start":1730.72,"duration":2.079},{"text":"to music","start":1732.159,"duration":3.52},{"text":"uh somehow is that there isn't one","start":1732.799,"duration":4.161},{"text":"definition of fairness","start":1735.679,"duration":3.36},{"text":"right uh if you look at philosophy","start":1736.96,"duration":3.76},{"text":"whether it's like moral or political","start":1739.039,"duration":3.601},{"text":"philosophy or you look at the law","start":1740.72,"duration":3.36},{"text":"or even you look at like the

right","start":1745.36,"duration":1.679},{"text":"who's","start":1746.64,"duration":2.88},{"text":"thinking about algorithmic bias one","start":1747.039,"duration":3.841},{"text":"common pattern is that","start":1749.52,"duration":2.639},{"text":"you have multiple definitions of","start":1750.88,"duration":2.799},{"text":"fairness that are mutually incompatible","start":1752.159,"duration":1.76},{"text":"so","start":1753.679,"duration":3.041},{"text":"you have to pick one right so in this","start":1753.919,"duration":4.161},{"text":"case the one that you could pick is you","start":1756.72,"duration":2.48},{"text":"could say well","start":1758.08,"duration":3.599},{"text":"i want to make sure that everyone","start":1759.2,"duration":4.719},{"text":"irrespective of their you know caste or","start":1761.679,"duration":4.72},{"text":"or religion is going to see content

uh","start":1768.48,"duration":5.84},{"text":"against harmful or like you know uh","start":1771.52,"duration":5.12},{"text":"content that is basically misleading or","start":1774.32,"duration":3.839},{"text":"you know imagine like it's like voter","start":1776.64,"duration":2.96},{"text":"suppression type of content there right","start":1778.159,"duration":2.961},{"text":"that spreads lies about like","start":1779.6,"duration":3.04},{"text":"i mean there's even stuff like just","start":1781.12,"duration":2.96},{"text":"lying about when the election day is or","start":1782.64,"duration":3.279},{"text":"like whatever you know","start":1784.08,"duration":3.92},{"text":"okay thanks that's helpful yeah yeah","start":1785.919,"duration":3.441},{"text":"then you then you kind of miss it right","start":1788.0,"duration":1.679},{"text":"or","start":1789.36,"duration":2.559},{"text":"or maybe like maybe lying about what","start":1789.679,"duration":3.921},{"text":"what a particular

completely","start":1795.2,"duration":3.44},{"text":"false or like right right right","start":1796.48,"duration":4.64},{"text":"so you want to yeah go ahead so so i","start":1798.64,"duration":3.039},{"text":"guess one","start":1801.12,"duration":1.76},{"text":"one way just to repeat back where you're","start":1801.679,"duration":2.88},{"text":"saying one way would be like we want to","start":1802.88,"duration":2.08},{"text":"make sure","start":1804.559,"duration":3.12},{"text":"everyone like across groups like cast or","start":1804.96,"duration":4.16},{"text":"religion gets the same level of","start":1807.679,"duration":2.321},{"text":"protection","start":1809.12,"duration":2.96},{"text":"correct by actual

fair","start":1813.84,"duration":3.36},{"text":"approach well","start":1816.48,"duration":2.0},{"text":"would there be a different argument for","start":1817.2,"duration":3.839},{"text":"different yeah yeah you have situations","start":1818.48,"duration":3.52},{"text":"where so so","start":1821.039,"duration":3.12},{"text":"here you know uh this would be like an","start":1822.0,"duration":3.039},{"text":"equal treatment","start":1824.159,"duration":3.041},{"text":"type of type of argument where you would","start":1825.039,"duration":3.601},{"text":"say you

i","start":1828.64,"duration":3.2},{"text":"think","start":1830.88,"duration":3.6},{"text":"in many cultures uh like the sort of","start":1831.84,"duration":3.76},{"text":"like the first instinct","start":1834.48,"duration":2.72},{"text":"that that you have but but you could","start":1835.6,"duration":2.959},{"text":"think about other things right you could","start":1837.2,"duration":1.76},{"text":"think","start":1838.559,"duration":2.641},{"text":"uh on the one hand you could dial things","start":1838.96,"duration":3.439},{"text":"more towards uh","start":1841.2,"duration":3.68},{"text":"equity and in inequity you could look at","start":1842.399,"duration":4.0},{"text":"like historical","start":1844.88,"duration":4.0},{"text":"uh uh you know disadvantages that some","start":1846.399,"duration":3.601},{"text":"group might have had right","start":1848.88,"duration":3.279},{"text":"like is there is there a case where like","start":1850.0,"duration":3.36},{"text":"historically","start":1852.159,"duration":3.52},{"text":"you know some cats and religions are are","start":1853.36,"duration":3.52},{"text":"privileged","start":1855.679,"duration":3.041},{"text":"compared to others and and like the","start":1856.88,"duration":3.039},{"text":"pressure you know","start":1858.72,"duration":4.0},{"text":"or like um the amount of misinformation","start":1859.919,"duration":4.48},{"text":"or like you know if you think about the","start":1862.72,"duration":3.12},{"text":"u.s right like not every group in the","start":1864.399,"duration":3.76},{"text":"u.s has historically had equal access to","start":1865.84,"duration":2.959},{"text":"bubble team","start":1868.159,"duration":2.801},{"text":"right and even today like voter","start":1868.799,"duration":3.281},{"text":"suppression efforts","start":1870.96,"duration":3.28},{"text":"are not um uniformly distributed like","start":1872.08,"duration":3.36},{"text":"some some groups are actually more","start":1874.24,"duration":2.48},{"text":"targeted than others right","start":1875.44,"duration":2.56},{"text":"so you could actually say no i'm","start":1876.72,"duration":3.04},{"text":"actually going to understand you know","start":1878.0,"duration":4.24},{"text":"whether i should prioritize outcomes for","start":1879.76,"duration":4.72},{"text":"for for some groups over others right","start":1882.24,"duration":4.319},{"text":"and and you know if you think about like","start":1884.48,"duration":3.679},{"text":"um","start":1886.559,"duration":3.12},{"text":"you know there's many as many sort of","start":1888.159,"duration":3.841},{"text":"public policies in society that actually","start":1889.679,"duration":4.88},{"text":"sort of aim at you know uh focusing more","start":1892.0,"duration":4.0},{"text":"on on some groups that have been","start":1894.559,"duration":4.561},{"text":"disadvantaged i see and so what did you","start":1896.0,"duration":3.76},{"text":"do","start":1899.12,"duration":4.32},{"text":"so in this case we we went for the equal","start":1899.76,"duration":5.84},{"text":"treatment you know approach and then","start":1903.44,"duration":3.359},{"text":"what we did this triggered a whole","start":1905.6,"duration":3.04},{"text":"amount of work you know we first of all","start":1906.799,"duration":4.641},{"text":"we don't have cast and religion and we","start":1908.64,"duration":4.399},{"text":"there's many reasons there's many risks","start":1911.44,"duration":3.28},{"text":"you know uh why","start":1913.039,"duration":3.681},{"text":"a corporation shouldn't have you know","start":1914.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"certain type of demographic","start":1916.72,"duration":4.079},{"text":"information uh there's like a lot of","start":1918.0,"duration":4.32},{"text":"examples in history why","start":1920.799,"duration":3.521},{"text":"it's it's just dangerous to have","start":1922.32,"duration":3.68},{"text":"repositories of certain","start":1924.32,"duration":4.479},{"text":"you know demographic characteristics so","start":1926.0,"duration":3.919},{"text":"what we did is we used","start":1928.799,"duration":3.76},{"text":"reasonable alternatives like uh language","start":1929.919,"duration":3.12},{"text":"and","start":1932.559,"duration":2.561},{"text":"region right and so we said okay we're","start":1933.039,"duration":3.201},{"text":"gonna make sure that all religions in","start":1935.12,"duration":2.08},{"text":"india and like","start":1936.24,"duration":2.799},{"text":"not all languages because it's like a","start":1937.2,"duration":3.359},{"text":"huge amount of languages in india but","start":1939.039,"duration":2.081},{"text":"like","start":1940.559,"duration":3.12},{"text":"i think we went for like the top i don't","start":1941.12,"duration":4.64},{"text":"remember anymore top 15 plus minus you","start":1943.679,"duration":2.48},{"text":"know","start":1945.76,"duration":3.44},{"text":"languages are sort of well protected and","start":1946.159,"duration":4.481},{"text":"then you can get into things okay how do","start":1949.2,"duration":3.12},{"text":"i translate into math and code","start":1950.64,"duration":4.32},{"text":"right so and so you need to look at many","start":1952.32,"duration":4.079},{"text":"levels right like one you need to look","start":1954.96,"duration":2.079},{"text":"uh","start":1956.399,"duration":2.16},{"text":"you know the most basic thing is when","start":1957.039,"duration":2.961},{"text":"you look at the data you look at two","start":1958.559,"duration":2.081},{"text":"things","start":1960.0,"duration":2.32},{"text":"you look at representation and then you","start":1960.64,"duration":3.759},{"text":"look at biases in the labels right","start":1962.32,"duration":4.239},{"text":"so representation make sure that across","start":1964.399,"duration":3.841},{"text":"you know you build yourself your matrix","start":1966.559,"duration":2.401},{"text":"of like you know","start":1968.24,"duration":2.64},{"text":"regions and languages and make sure that","start":1968.96,"duration":3.28},{"text":"for each of these buckets","start":1970.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you have a sufficient amount of uh","start":1972.24,"duration":4.08},{"text":"labeled training data","start":1974.72,"duration":3.439},{"text":"and then and then and then once you're","start":1976.32,"duration":3.92},{"text":"in in one of these buckets you kind of","start":1978.159,"duration":3.681},{"text":"you get yourself some uh some some","start":1980.24,"duration":3.039},{"text":"ground truth data and","start":1981.84,"duration":2.64},{"text":"that would be like a very long","start":1983.279,"duration":2.561},{"text":"conversation to figure out what that is","start":1984.48,"duration":2.079},{"text":"but like","start":1985.84,"duration":2.8},{"text":"yeah expensive high quality data that","start":1986.559,"duration":3.681},{"text":"you can use as a reference right","start":1988.64,"duration":4.24},{"text":"and then you kind of measure you know","start":1990.24,"duration":4.319},{"text":"you look at the difference in errors","start":1992.88,"duration":3.279},{"text":"that you have in your labeling process","start":1994.559,"duration":3.281},{"text":"across all these buckets and you want to","start":1996.159,"duration":2.961},{"text":"make sure that you don't have systematic","start":1997.84,"duration":1.839},{"text":"differences","start":1999.12,"duration":2.0},{"text":"but of course that's not enough right","start":1999.679,"duration":2.961},{"text":"then then you actually look at your your","start":2001.12,"duration":2.48},{"text":"models themselves","start":2002.64,"duration":2.639},{"text":"you train your model and you look at","start":2003.6,"duration":3.52},{"text":"things like oh you know","start":2005.279,"duration":3.76},{"text":"in the in the prediction errors do i","start":2007.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"have you know systematic","start":2009.039,"duration":3.36},{"text":"uh differences and one cool thing to","start":2010.48,"duration":4.24},{"text":"look at if you have binary classifiers","start":2012.399,"duration":5.28},{"text":"uh and you're using you know here you","start":2014.72,"duration":4.559},{"text":"would be using the probability

an","start":2252.8,"duration":3.279},{"text":"input to my algorithm","start":2254.88,"duration":2.959},{"text":"then i know i'm going to be i'm going to","start":2256.079,"duration":3.04},{"text":"be fine","start":2257.839,"duration":2.641},{"text":"and the reason is simple right is that","start":2259.119,"duration":2.641},{"text":"hey you have a lot of features that","start":2260.48,"duration":2.32},{"text":"correlate with gender","start":2261.76,"duration":3.599},{"text":"anyway but then also if you think about","start":2262.8,"duration":4.559},{"text":"it

it's like it's important that","start":2321.44,"duration":2.24},{"text":"someone kind of understands

so","start":2396.8,"duration":3.039},{"text":"on","start":2398.8,"duration":2.799},{"text":"and you know one example of this i think","start":2399.839,"duration":3.041},{"text":"that is quite

means","start":3669.44,"duration":5.44},{"text":"having a team that has um","start":3670.88,"duration":8.16},{"text":"people from different uh","start":3674.88,"duration":8.4},{"text":"you know both

are","start":3703.839,"duration":3.361},{"text":"right so","start":3705.76,"duration":3.2},{"text":"so bringing that sort of diversity into","start":3707.2,"duration":3.04},{"text":"into teams","start":3708.96,"duration":4.159},{"text":"is very important because teams that","start":3710.24,"duration":4.799},{"text":"have that sort of diversity tend to

a couple of questions","start":3770.64,"duration":4.8},{"text":"question number one is well how do you","start":3773.92,"duration":3.119},{"text":"do that like how do you build a team","start":3775.44,"duration":2.399},{"text":"like that","start":3777.039,"duration":3.681},{"text":"and question number two why do you do it","start":3777.839,"duration":4.401},{"text":"do you build a team like that","start":3780.72,"duration":3.2},{"text":"you know because it's a necessary","start":3782.24,"duration":3.359},{"text":"condition in order to build responsible","start":3783.92,"duration":2.399},{"text":"ai","start":3785.599,"duration":1.841},{"text":"so i'm going to start with a second","start":3786.319,"duration":4.24},{"text":"question because it's tricky","start":3787.44,"duration":4.399},{"text":"and this is something that we've debated","start":3790.559,"duration":3.28},{"text":"a lot","start":3791.839,"duration":5.441},{"text":"so one danger one risk in","start":3793.839,"duration":5.921},{"text":"coupling together you know the goal of","start":3797.28,"duration":4.4},{"text":"responsibility and the goal of diversity","start":3799.76,"duration":3.2},{"text":"and inclusion","start":3801.68,"duration":2.8},{"text":"is that the burden of building","start":3802.96,"duration":3.359},{"text":"responsible ai

right","start":3814.88,"duration":3.04},{"text":"whenever i'm in a","start":3816.799,"duration":3.121},{"text":"in in a forum that's trying to tackle","start":3817.92,"duration":4.919},{"text":"you

right","start":3828.799,"duration":3.361},{"text":"and it's interesting because because i","start":3830.96,"duration":1.92},{"text":"guess like","start":3832.16,"duration":2.48},{"text":"um this is this kind of like a sense of","start":3832.88,"duration":3.199},{"text":"duty right in in","start":3834.64,"duration":2.719},{"text":"in making sure that the ai is built","start":3836.079,"duration":3.601},{"text":"responsibly if you are you know a member","start":3837.359,"duration":2.801},{"text":"of an","start":3839.68,"duration":2.72},{"text":"underrepresented group so so the danger","start":3840.16,"duration":4.32},{"text":"a little bit with uh","start":3842.4,"duration":4.159},{"text":"ascribing you know the goal of diversity","start":3844.48,"duration":3.04},{"text":"inclusion you know","start":3846.559,"duration":2.24},{"text":"as like

burden","start":3850.319,"duration":4.72},{"text":"on only on a subgroup so it's very very","start":3852.16,"duration":4.24},{"text":"important to actually keep these two","start":3855.039,"duration":2.0},{"text":"goals","start":3856.4,"duration":2.56},{"text":"separate and to sort of say like no","start":3857.039,"duration":3.601},{"text":"building responsibility

diverse","start":3863.599,"duration":4.081},{"text":"and inclusive teams which will help","start":3865.359,"duration":4.321},{"text":"right with responsibility goals right","start":3867.68,"duration":5.119},{"text":"but um it also will just create teams","start":3869.68,"duration":4.56},{"text":"that make better decisions overall so","start":3872.799,"duration":2.0},{"text":"let's just","start":3874.24,"duration":3.28},{"text":"focus on that part so how do you do this","start":3874.799,"duration":3.441},{"text":"um","start":3877.52,"duration":2.319},{"text":"all right i have one more question on","start":3878.24,"duration":3.92},{"text":"that first point

to","start":4189.679,"duration":3.201},{"text":"do is to say","start":4191.839,"duration":4.081},{"text":"look um if you have a position open you","start":4192.88,"duration":4.16},{"text":"can't just go and do like an","start":4195.92,"duration":2.72},{"text":"opportunistic hiring where you just go","start":4197.04,"duration":3.04},{"text":"and i grab your friend or your pal

you","start":4210.56,"duration":4.639},{"text":"just go out and you you make sure that","start":4213.6,"duration":3.36},{"text":"you have a slate of of candidates that","start":4215.199,"duration":2.561},{"text":"you consider","start":4216.96,"duration":2.8},{"text":"that is diverse now once you have that","start":4217.76,"duration":3.68},{"text":"slate you have a","start":4219.76,"duration":3.919},{"text":"the bar is the same for everybody right","start":4221.44,"duration":3.84},{"text":"and so and that worked like in the

right","start":4231.199,"duration":5.04},{"text":"um other things that you can do is um","start":4232.719,"duration":5.041},{"text":"make sure that you have

that","start":4246.64,"duration":2.96},{"text":"barrier","start":4248.56,"duration":3.28},{"text":"and then inside the organization on like","start":4249.6,"duration":3.92},{"text":"growing and

you know talks and um","start":4274.64,"duration":6.88},{"text":"and um and resources out there","start":4278.239,"duration":5.121},{"text":"to just to just raise awareness is this","start":4281.52,"duration":3.12},{"text":"this is small things you know this is","start":4283.36,"duration":2.72},{"text":"training that we have at facebook

noticed","start":4294.96,"duration":2.56},{"text":"you know","start":4297.04,"duration":1.76},{"text":"and like maybe you know their voice","start":4297.52,"duration":3.12},{"text":"isn't heard right uh","start":4298.8,"duration":4.0},{"text":"or even maybe maybe you sort of like","start":4300.64,"duration":3.84},{"text":"witness you know like a micro

feel","start":4317.12,"duration":4.4},{"text":"and these small things they make uh they","start":4319.76,"duration":3.76},{"text":"make a huge difference in creating uh","start":4321.52,"duration":2.4},{"text":"you know","start":4323.52,"duration":3.12},{"text":"an inclusive culture on career growth","start":4323.92,"duration":3.36},{"text":"right

well","start":4346.0,"duration":3.04},{"text":"because sometimes if you templatize it","start":4347.6,"duration":2.8},{"text":"you know and your requirements are like","start":4349.04,"duration":2.0},{"text":"you know","start":4350.4,"duration":2.799},{"text":"uh the same they might not be you know","start":4351.04,"duration":3.36},{"text":"uh adequate for","start":4353.199,"duration":4.241},{"text":"for for certain people that end a lot","start":4354.4,"duration":5.04},{"text":"more but that kind of like gives you a","start":4357.44,"duration":6.239},{"text":"a couple of a couple of ideas","start":4359.44,"duration":4.239},{"text":"i'm curious you have any suggestions for","start":4364.0,"duration":3.36},{"text":"this um so these","start":4365.6,"duration":4.48},{"text":"these recordings that we do we know um","start":4367.36,"duration":3.76},{"text":"we can look at the","start":4370.08,"duration":2.24},{"text":"um we can look at the gender","start":4371.12,"duration":3.28},{"text":"distribution of people watching and it","start":4372.32,"duration":3.919},{"text":"actually skews over 90 percent","start":4374.4,"duration":4.56},{"text":"um mail right and it's funny because our","start":4376.239,"duration":4.241},{"text":"user base is actually","start":4378.96,"duration":4.4},{"text":"not that lopsided so um it feels like","start":4380.48,"duration":4.08},{"text":"maybe there's something we're doing","start":4383.36,"duration":2.08},{"text":"that's not","start":4384.56,"duration":3.599},{"text":"um connecting at least with with um","start":4385.44,"duration":4.88},{"text":"women that might be watching it","start":4388.159,"duration":4.721},{"text":"i guess how would you approach that well","start":4390.32,"duration":3.04},{"text":"um","start":4392.88,"duration":2.64},{"text":"my initial reaction was please ask the","start":4393.36,"duration":3.44},{"text":"women who are not watching","start":4395.52,"duration":6.0},{"text":"but uh yeah fair enough but","start":4396.8,"duration":6.56},{"text":"um a couple of thoughts that come to","start":4401.52,"duration":3.04},{"text":"mind i mean the other one actually is","start":4403.36,"duration":2.799},{"text":"extremely important like doing some user","start":4404.56,"duration":2.96},{"text":"research and understanding like","start":4406.159,"duration":3.04},{"text":"like why is this not resonating why is","start":4407.52,"duration":3.12},{"text":"this not useful to you","start":4409.199,"duration":3.841},{"text":"a couple of other thoughts obviously you","start":4410.64,"duration":3.12},{"text":"know","start":4413.04,"duration":3.119},{"text":"um one of them is like on the on the","start":4413.76,"duration":3.919},{"text":"topics that are that are covered right","start":4416.159,"duration":2.721},{"text":"which is actually tied to what","start":4417.679,"duration":2.641},{"text":"what i just said right to understand","start":4418.88,"duration":3.359},{"text":"whether those are not useful","start":4420.32,"duration":3.6},{"text":"and then the other one which i don't","start":4422.239,"duration":3.201},{"text":"know if you already do is","start":4423.92,"duration":4.16},{"text":"is to make sure to have at least as many","start":4425.44,"duration":4.32},{"text":"female speakers as you have","start":4428.08,"duration":4.159},{"text":"um male speakers and again that's an","start":4429.76,"duration":3.52},{"text":"interesting thing right because you","start":4432.239,"duration":2.0},{"text":"might say well","start":4433.28,"duration":2.56},{"text":"you know maybe the potential audience is","start":4434.239,"duration":3.201},{"text":"actually a majority","start":4435.84,"duration":4.08},{"text":"male and and a minority female but that","start":4437.44,"duration":3.92},{"text":"is an interesting point of intervention","start":4439.92,"duration":2.96},{"text":"right where you could sort of say well","start":4441.36,"duration":3.2},{"text":"that's fine but we're still going to aim","start":4442.88,"duration":3.68},{"text":"for for 50 50.","start":4444.56,"duration":4.72},{"text":"um make sense you know we always end","start":4446.56,"duration":4.159},{"text":"with two questions and i'd love to","start":4449.28,"duration":3.439},{"text":"do that with you too and and kind of get","start":4450.719,"duration":2.801},{"text":"your thoughts these are a little bit","start":4452.719,"duration":1.761},{"text":"open-ended","start":4453.52,"duration":2.32},{"text":"um and i haven't prepped you for them","start":4454.48,"duration":3.6},{"text":"but i'm curious what you say so um","start":4455.84,"duration":4.8},{"text":"so one question we always end with is um","start":4458.08,"duration":4.56},{"text":"you know what's an underrated aspect","start":4460.64,"duration":3.599},{"text":"of machine learning that you think","start":4462.64,"duration":3.12},{"text":"people should pay more attention to","start":4464.239,"duration":3.121},{"text":"and maybe for you i'd tailor it to sort","start":4465.76,"duration":4.399},{"text":"of like in ethics and responsible ai","start":4467.36,"duration":4.56},{"text":"um what's something that you feel like","start":4470.159,"duration":3.281},{"text":"maybe doesn't get the attention deserves","start":4471.92,"duration":2.08},{"text":"it might be","start":4473.44,"duration":2.88},{"text":"the whole topic doesn't but like within","start":4474.0,"duration":3.6},{"text":"that is there something you'd especially","start":4476.32,"duration":2.56},{"text":"like to call out","start":4477.6,"duration":3.28},{"text":"yeah just be aware of averages you know","start":4478.88,"duration":4.0},{"text":"i hate averages and aggregated metrics","start":4480.88,"duration":4.4},{"text":"it's as simple as that but like if you","start":4482.88,"duration":3.76},{"text":"if you want to develop ai more","start":4485.28,"duration":3.6},{"text":"responsibility more responsibly sorry","start":4486.64,"duration":3.92},{"text":"try to desegregate your methods","start":4488.88,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you just talked about gender right if","start":4490.56,"duration":3.119},{"text":"you have access to gender","start":4492.32,"duration":2.96},{"text":"or if you have ways in which you can you","start":4493.679,"duration":3.121},{"text":"know have like the right sort of uh","start":4495.28,"duration":3.6},{"text":"explicit informed consent for your users","start":4496.8,"duration":3.28},{"text":"you know to give their gender and be","start":4498.88,"duration":2.24},{"text":"transparent about what you're going to","start":4500.08,"duration":2.0},{"text":"use it for","start":4501.12,"duration":2.72},{"text":"if you have location you know because","start":4502.08,"duration":4.0},{"text":"obviously even if you only take the us","start":4503.84,"duration":4.0},{"text":"right like the south is very different","start":4506.08,"duration":3.2},{"text":"from the coast very different from the","start":4507.84,"duration":2.64},{"text":"center and so on right","start":4509.28,"duration":3.52},{"text":"like desegregate your metrics and the","start":4510.48,"duration":4.08},{"text":"test that i like to give is this right","start":4512.8,"duration":4.96},{"text":"it's like presumably if you're launching","start":4514.56,"duration":4.88},{"text":"a new refresh of your ai","start":4517.76,"duration":3.36},{"text":"whatever it might be or a new model or","start":4519.44,"duration":3.759},{"text":"whatever presumably you have a launch","start":4521.12,"duration":3.68},{"text":"criteria right like you have criteria to","start":4523.199,"duration":2.641},{"text":"launch or not launch","start":4524.8,"duration":2.56},{"text":"and and and most of the time what i","start":4525.84,"duration":3.28},{"text":"observe is that it's just an all-out","start":4527.36,"duration":2.24},{"text":"metric","start":4529.12,"duration":3.599},{"text":"that aggregates over all users right uh","start":4529.6,"duration":4.96},{"text":"well don't do that instead you know kind","start":4532.719,"duration":3.201},{"text":"of disaggregate","start":4534.56,"duration":3.36},{"text":"and and look you know across maybe","start":4535.92,"duration":4.319},{"text":"gender age and location just simple","start":4537.92,"duration":3.36},{"text":"things","start":4540.239,"duration":2.881},{"text":"and then ask yourself you know if you","start":4541.28,"duration":3.52},{"text":"find a bucket that is significant you","start":4543.12,"duration":2.48},{"text":"know","start":4544.8,"duration":4.32},{"text":"uh where your ai performs the worst","start":4545.6,"duration":6.32},{"text":"would you see launch and and and you","start":4549.12,"duration":4.32},{"text":"know like show care right that would be","start":4551.92,"duration":3.2},{"text":"a","start":4553.44,"duration":3.36},{"text":"they'll be like a very sort of practical","start":4555.12,"duration":3.76},{"text":"you know uh thing to do","start":4556.8,"duration":4.0},{"text":"i would say it's my reaction is that's a","start":4558.88,"duration":3.76},{"text":"great suggestion for","start":4560.8,"duration":5.6},{"text":"just competently launching ai also so","start":4562.64,"duration":5.12},{"text":"there's no trade-off here i think","start":4566.4,"duration":3.44},{"text":"definitely um looking at distributions","start":4567.76,"duration":3.6},{"text":"of things versus averages is a really","start":4569.84,"duration":2.56},{"text":"good idea","start":4571.36,"duration":4.319},{"text":"um somehow i feel like you get less um","start":4572.4,"duration":5.6},{"text":"less sort of like gaussian distributions","start":4575.679,"duration":4.961},{"text":"in ai than you do outside of it so","start":4578.0,"duration":5.6},{"text":"um yeah","start":4580.64,"duration":2.96},{"text":"yeah yeah people i mean i still see that","start":4583.92,"duration":4.239},{"text":"i call up averages everywhere i look you","start":4586.56,"duration":2.72},{"text":"know so i feel like","start":4588.159,"duration":3.04},{"text":"we don't have like a like a discipline","start":4589.28,"duration":5.12},{"text":"of doing it","start":4591.199,"duration":6.241},{"text":"um okay now last question","start":4594.4,"duration":4.799},{"text":"um i mean maybe this actually goes back","start":4597.44,"duration":3.36},{"text":"to like all the work that you've done in","start":4599.199,"duration":4.96},{"text":"in your career um but when you look at","start":4600.8,"duration":5.6},{"text":"the the kind of productization of","start":4604.159,"duration":3.52},{"text":"machine learning like taking","start":4606.4,"duration":4.4},{"text":"an ml

you","start":159.599,"duration":2.64},{"text":"can trade it and so on","start":160.959,"duration":2.801},{"text":"so sort of the the some of

eventually","start":217.2,"duration":4.24},{"text":"maybe will have this positive impact and","start":219.04,"duration":4.24},{"text":"uh so that's that's kind of what ai","start":221.44,"duration":3.12},{"text":"economist is and","start":223.28,"duration":4.0},{"text":"what's interesting technically and hard","start":224.56,"duration":3.679},{"text":"about it is that","start":227.28,"duration":2.64},{"text":"with this two-level reinforcement","start":228.239,"duration":3.521},{"text":"learning you essentially the","start":229.92,"duration":3.92},{"text":"economist keeps changing the goal post","start":231.76,"duration":4.16},{"text":"for all the rl agents","start":233.84,"duration":3.599},{"text":"and they

then uh all of a sudden the","start":244.4,"duration":3.52},{"text":"economist changes it because they","start":246.64,"duration":1.76},{"text":"realize","start":247.92,"duration":2.399},{"text":"like you have a monopoly and equality is","start":248.4,"duration":3.919},{"text":"suffering and maybe you're gonna tax the","start":250.319,"duration":3.2},{"text":"person with the monopoly a little

now all of a sudden the","start":256.239,"duration":3.361},{"text":"agents have to adapt","start":258.16,"duration":4.72},{"text":"to and in almost all rl

what you need to fit like this","start":265.919,"duration":2.801},{"text":"is how you win go this is how you win","start":267.199,"duration":2.801},{"text":"chess this is how you win","start":268.72,"duration":3.759},{"text":"atari games and so on they don't change","start":270.0,"duration":4.16},{"text":"uh and here the goalpost keeps changing","start":272.479,"duration":3.361},{"text":"so it is a really hard interesting","start":274.16,"duration":3.12},{"text":"optimization problem","start":275.84,"duration":3.6},{"text":"so so that's kind of what ai economist","start":277.28,"duration":4.16},{"text":"is now how did we get to that idea","start":279.44,"duration":3.92},{"text":"uh it actually came from a couple of","start":281.44,"duration":3.039},{"text":"different uh","start":283.36,"duration":3.119},{"text":"strains my the first time i had this","start":284.479,"duration":4.081},{"text":"idea was during my phd","start":286.479,"duration":4.401},{"text":"where this idea of and essentially all","start":288.56,"duration":4.079},{"text":"these different cultures in the world","start":290.88,"duration":5.12},{"text":"uh have had uh their different energy","start":292.639,"duration":5.041},{"text":"landscapes on their

similar things you would hope","start":300.32,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you know people want to prosper","start":302.24,"duration":4.959},{"text":"uh people want to have certain amenities","start":304.16,"duration":4.24},{"text":"and freedoms and","start":307.199,"duration":3.681},{"text":"and so on uh but they all end up in","start":308.4,"duration":4.32},{"text":"their different local optima","start":310.88,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and i thought about this as like this","start":312.72,"duration":3.12},{"text":"non-convex objective function that","start":314.32,"duration":2.96},{"text":"different cultures go on and try to","start":315.84,"duration":2.799},{"text":"optimize it and end up in all these","start":317.28,"duration":2.8},{"text":"different local optima","start":318.639,"duration":3.601},{"text":"and and so that was kind of idea but i","start":320.08,"duration":4.0},{"text":"didn't quite know how to","start":322.24,"duration":3.84},{"text":"structure it as like an ai problem i","start":324.08,"duration":3.92},{"text":"just had some sort of quick little notes","start":326.08,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and i drew some objective functions and","start":328.0,"duration":2.639},{"text":"i kind of just started and","start":329.52,"duration":4.16},{"text":"continued to do nlp research and then uh","start":330.639,"duration":4.961},{"text":"we hired stefan chang the first author","start":333.68,"duration":3.359},{"text":"of the ai economist","start":335.6,"duration":5.2},{"text":"and uh we've also had uh alex trot in","start":337.039,"duration":5.841},{"text":"the team already for a year and with him","start":340.8,"duration":5.28},{"text":"we're working on trying to build uh","start":342.88,"duration":5.44},{"text":"houses just from like lots of bricks you","start":346.08,"duration":4.0},{"text":"collect resources and you have a 3d","start":348.32,"duration":2.8},{"text":"agent","start":350.08,"duration":2.72},{"text":"like something like minecraft

properly","start":368.0,"duration":3.919},{"text":"before we could get to that ai economist","start":369.919,"duration":2.72},{"text":"i thought","start":371.919,"duration":2.56},{"text":"stefan like hey why don't we just go","start":372.639,"duration":3.761},{"text":"directly assume the house building is","start":374.479,"duration":3.601},{"text":"just one action built a house in

that","start":637.6,"duration":4.239},{"text":"um when a politician in the future would","start":638.64,"duration":4.16},{"text":"say","start":641.839,"duration":3.201},{"text":"i want to help the

then eventually either you know","start":647.279,"duration":3.361},{"text":"right away during their campaign or","start":649.04,"duration":3.039},{"text":"later on they propose to say","start":650.64,"duration":3.04},{"text":"now this is what i'm going to do to do","start":652.079,"duration":4.0},{"text":"this and then you run that setup through","start":653.68,"duration":3.279},{"text":"the simulation","start":656.079,"duration":3.121},{"text":"and you say that is really different","start":656.959,"duration":4.401},{"text":"from any

that","start":667.839,"duration":3.841},{"text":"will actually help more than these other","start":669.76,"duration":5.12},{"text":"ways and so hopefully we can agree","start":671.68,"duration":4.96},{"text":"more easily on the objective function","start":674.88,"duration":3.68},{"text":"and then we can disagree less","start":676.64,"duration":4.72},{"text":"on how to exercise and how to get there","start":678.56,"duration":4.64},{"text":"in your simulation","start":681.36,"duration":3.599},{"text":"was there

of","start":686.32,"duration":3.68},{"text":"that you discovered from doing these","start":687.839,"duration":3.361},{"text":"experiments","start":690.0,"duration":2.959},{"text":"yeah there's definitely some things that","start":691.2,"duration":3.12},{"text":"at first you're like wait this doesn't","start":692.959,"duration":2.641},{"text":"make sense so we have","start":694.32,"duration":3.28},{"text":"taxes and we have subsidies and when you","start":695.6,"duration":4.16},{"text":"look at it it's actually the","start":697.6,"duration":4.88},{"text":"lowest income bracket got taxed a lot","start":699.76,"duration":4.0},{"text":"and then it actually went down","start":702.48,"duration":3.2},{"text":"for this sort of middle class of the","start":703.76,"duration":3.199},{"text":"simulation","start":705.68,"duration":2.719},{"text":"and we're like wait a minute that","start":706.959,"duration":2.481},{"text":"doesn't that seems very","start":708.399,"duration":2.641},{"text":"counter-intuitive but it turned out they","start":709.44,"duration":3.199},{"text":"were also getting more subsidies","start":711.04,"duration":4.56},{"text":"so they actually like it net net they","start":712.639,"duration":4.88},{"text":"were actually much more positive","start":715.6,"duration":4.96},{"text":"um because the subsidies were also given","start":717.519,"duration":5.76},{"text":"to that income bracket um but that at","start":720.56,"duration":4.32},{"text":"first was kind of counterintuitive but","start":723.279,"duration":2.0},{"text":"then","start":724.88,"duration":1.519},{"text":"once you double clicked on it and you","start":725.279,"duration":3.201},{"text":"realize well effectively they're","start":726.399,"duration":2.88},{"text":"actually","start":728.48,"duration":2.56},{"text":"uh getting more subsidies than they have","start":729.279,"duration":3.761},{"text":"to pay taxes so it kind of leveled out","start":731.04,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and made more sense","start":733.04,"duration":3.28},{"text":"interesting and sorry this is i guess","start":734.48,"duration":3.12},{"text":"this may be a personal question but you","start":736.32,"duration":3.44},{"text":"grew up in eastern germany didn't you","start":737.6,"duration":5.12},{"text":"i did for a couple years after three","start":739.76,"duration":3.84},{"text":"years and uh","start":742.72,"duration":3.44},{"text":"four years or so of uh east germany and","start":743.6,"duration":3.2},{"text":"uh","start":746.16,"duration":3.359},{"text":"and then germany reunited yeah i see do","start":746.8,"duration":3.839},{"text":"you feel like that gives you a different","start":749.519,"duration":2.161},{"text":"perspective maybe than","start":750.639,"duration":3.921},{"text":"americans on on these topics i mean you","start":751.68,"duration":3.44},{"text":"know i think","start":754.56,"duration":3.2},{"text":"i was i was still pretty young when uh","start":755.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"when the","start":757.76,"duration":4.0},{"text":"berlin wall came down and so i think","start":758.48,"duration":5.12},{"text":"though culturally of course east germany","start":761.76,"duration":3.199},{"text":"still had you know it wasn't like","start":763.6,"duration":3.12},{"text":"germany reunited and then there's like","start":764.959,"duration":3.12},{"text":"no more differences between east and","start":766.72,"duration":2.32},{"text":"west in fact","start":768.079,"duration":3.281},{"text":"some of the

like","start":772.639,"duration":3.681},{"text":"the east still has lower","start":774.079,"duration":5.601},{"text":"uh income compared to the west and uh","start":776.32,"duration":6.639},{"text":"a lot of uh women actually left um","start":779.68,"duration":5.36},{"text":"eastern east germany to go to the west","start":782.959,"duration":3.601},{"text":"so there are a couple of counties that","start":785.04,"duration":2.0},{"text":"have","start":786.56,"duration":3.12},{"text":"like too many men um and so on so","start":787.04,"duration":4.4},{"text":"there's still a lot of differences","start":789.68,"duration":3.68},{"text":"between the east and west uh still to","start":791.44,"duration":3.28},{"text":"this day um","start":793.36,"duration":3.44},{"text":"but i think uh you know sort of growing","start":794.72,"duration":3.919},{"text":"up in germany overall which is where you","start":796.8,"duration":3.68},{"text":"know the time i got most of my education","start":798.639,"duration":3.44},{"text":"was in reunited germany","start":800.48,"duration":4.799},{"text":"um uh probably did affect me","start":802.079,"duration":6.641},{"text":"like in general as i grew up it was a","start":805.279,"duration":6.321},{"text":"free health care and free education all","start":808.72,"duration":3.6},{"text":"the way down","start":811.6,"duration":4.56},{"text":"to or up to a phd level master's level","start":812.32,"duration":6.959},{"text":"was just not ever a politicized

a","start":830.959,"duration":3.201},{"text":"century","start":833.199,"duration":3.76},{"text":"uh it was clear that that's something we","start":834.16,"duration":4.88},{"text":"should all try to add as best as we can","start":836.959,"duration":3.12},{"text":"to avoid","start":839.04,"duration":3.68},{"text":"so there's a lot less sort

so it's kind of","start":847.199,"duration":2.721},{"text":"interesting the whole political","start":848.959,"duration":2.641},{"text":"discourse in germany has kind of

always","start":875.12,"duration":3.12},{"text":"have health care no matter what job you","start":876.88,"duration":3.04},{"text":"have or is it less free because you have","start":878.24,"duration":2.64},{"text":"to pay for it","start":879.92,"duration":4.159},{"text":"like it's interesting uh interesting","start":880.88,"duration":4.56},{"text":"cultural

just","start":920.959,"duration":3.68},{"text":"if you could just describe i mean it's","start":923.36,"duration":2.8},{"text":"such an intriguing idea that

just","start":928.16,"duration":3.119},{"text":"tell us what you did and kind of","start":929.839,"duration":2.641},{"text":"what you think about the field

that","start":1148.08,"duration":2.88},{"text":"sort of one of the most exciting things","start":1149.12,"duration":4.16},{"text":"is if you find a new model

uh","start":1189.6,"duration":3.68},{"text":"great story for for technology so long","start":1190.88,"duration":3.76},{"text":"story short we predict","start":1193.28,"duration":4.88},{"text":"uh each

you","start":1273.679,"duration":3.441},{"text":"could do","start":1274.88,"duration":4.64},{"text":"and so we have these control codes they","start":1277.12,"duration":3.919},{"text":"basically give you the function","start":1279.52,"duration":3.36},{"text":"and which area of the body and things","start":1281.039,"duration":3.041},{"text":"like that it's

see","start":1298.88,"duration":3.52},{"text":"how you could get like protein data from","start":1300.4,"duration":3.759},{"text":"dna but how did you get the data of

on","start":2642.8,"duration":2.08},{"text":"the","start":2644.4,"duration":3.36},{"text":"product side uh and and the large","start":2644.88,"duration":4.0},{"text":"engineering

with","start":2664.8,"duration":4.0},{"text":"uh so mark and i were on the keynote","start":2666.56,"duration":3.44},{"text":"stage and showing sort of what that","start":2668.8,"duration":2.799},{"text":"would look like and so","start":2670.0,"duration":3.839},{"text":"that is obviously something that maybe","start":2671.599,"duration":3.76},{"text":"customers aren't even","start":2673.839,"duration":3.441},{"text":"thinking yet about they're like because","start":2675.359,"duration":3.681},{"text":"they're not sure it's even possible","start":2677.28,"duration":3.12},{"text":"but we're working on those kinds

know yeah making it","start":2682.56,"duration":3.279},{"text":"possible","start":2685.04,"duration":2.64},{"text":"cool all right well we're running out of","start":2685.839,"duration":4.321},{"text":"time we always end with two questions um","start":2687.68,"duration":4.48},{"text":"that um i didn't warn you about but i'm","start":2690.16,"duration":5.199},{"text":"kind of curious what you'll say so","start":2692.16,"duration":5.52},{"text":"so the first question is um like what's","start":2695.359,"duration":3.041},{"text":"something","start":2697.68,"duration":3.04},{"text":"an aspect of machine learning that you","start":2698.4,"duration":3.76},{"text":"think

that","start":2704.319,"duration":6.721},{"text":"uh deep impact level on the world","start":2707.839,"duration":6.561},{"text":"we really need to think about the

thinking","start":2722.56,"duration":4.16},{"text":"enough about the bias","start":2725.44,"duration":3.919},{"text":"and uh as ai has a bigger and bigger","start":2726.72,"duration":4.879},{"text":"impact on people's lives","start":2729.359,"duration":4.641},{"text":"i think that the bar needs to increase","start":2731.599,"duration":4.881},{"text":"more and more like a loan application","start":2734.0,"duration":5.76},{"text":"uh ai that decides who should be able to","start":2736.48,"duration":4.879},{"text":"start a business and so on","start":2739.76,"duration":4.0},{"text":"you really need to pay a lot

and","start":2750.079,"duration":3.841},{"text":"what the status quo","start":2752.88,"duration":4.239},{"text":"is and uh and so on and how do you","start":2753.92,"duration":5.679},{"text":"how do you improve um how do you improve","start":2757.119,"duration":3.521},{"text":"the world in the end","start":2759.599,"duration":4.081},{"text":"uh versus uh entrenching it in in the","start":2760.64,"duration":3.92},{"text":"current system","start":2763.68,"duration":2.48},{"text":"uh and then just keeping the current","start":2764.56,"duration":3.44},{"text":"system uh the way it is","start":2766.16,"duration":3.84},{"text":"and i think that's that's sort of","start":2768.0,"duration":3.44},{"text":"something that a lot of practitioners","start":2770.0,"duration":2.56},{"text":"still need to work on","start":2771.44,"duration":3.2},{"text":"uh and now also more researchers need to","start":2772.56,"duration":3.44},{"text":"work on because","start":2774.64,"duration":3.12},{"text":"even when we play around with like oh","start":2776.0,"duration":3.359},{"text":"it's just a cute little artsy research","start":2777.76,"duration":3.359},{"text":"project right this depictionization","start":2779.359,"duration":3.441},{"text":"it actually is like it turns out it's","start":2781.119,"duration":3.921},{"text":"like another deeply rooted","start":2782.8,"duration":5.279},{"text":"uh bias that is there and that gets","start":2785.04,"duration":4.4},{"text":"exposed in that and then i think we","start":2788.079,"duration":2.721},{"text":"should all work on one more","start":2789.44,"duration":3.679},{"text":"do you have any suggested um like","start":2790.8,"duration":3.36},{"text":"reading material","start":2793.119,"duration":2.801},{"text":"or for people who want to get more","start":2794.16,"duration":3.28},{"text":"educated on the topic where you would","start":2795.92,"duration":2.0},{"text":"point them","start":2797.44,"duration":2.72},{"text":"yeah for sure i think i think that uh","start":2797.92,"duration":4.72},{"text":"timid gabriel right now is really one","start":2800.16,"duration":5.04},{"text":"of the leaders in that area and she she","start":2802.64,"duration":4.719},{"text":"has given this great tutorial at

she's sort of looked at","start":2814.88,"duration":4.16},{"text":"more of the applied side of ai a lot","start":2816.96,"duration":3.76},{"text":"more making sure that","start":2819.04,"duration":5.52},{"text":"ai systems are explainable","start":2820.72,"duration":5.84},{"text":"transparent that you have feedback

important","start":2828.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"decision about them was made in an","start":2830.64,"duration":3.28},{"text":"automated fashion they think it's wrong","start":2832.0,"duration":4.48},{"text":"that they're able to fix it uh and sort","start":2833.92,"duration":3.36},{"text":"of","start":2836.48,"duration":3.28},{"text":"escalate it to humans

so on so there are a couple of","start":2847.52,"duration":3.44},{"text":"different uh things like","start":2848.64,"duration":4.719},{"text":"making sure even sounds kind of crazy","start":2850.96,"duration":3.68},{"text":"but i think we need to even think about","start":2853.359,"duration":2.401},{"text":"human rights","start":2854.64,"duration":3.76},{"text":"uh when it comes to ai applications that","start":2855.76,"duration":3.92},{"text":"we work on and so","start":2858.4,"duration":3.36},{"text":"so i think kathy baxter has a lot of","start":2859.68,"duration":3.919},{"text":"materials online interviews and","start":2861.76,"duration":3.599},{"text":"materials we have some trailheads

research","start":2888.0,"duration":2.64},{"text":"perspective but you're at a company that","start":2889.2,"duration":2.879},{"text":"does lots of applied","start":2890.64,"duration":3.52},{"text":"machine learning um when you look at","start":2892.079,"duration":3.28},{"text":"that path from","start":2894.16,"duration":4.08},{"text":"like taking like a research thing to you","start":2895.359,"duration":3.76},{"text":"know deployed","start":2898.24,"duration":2.8},{"text":"inside the salesforce product what's","start":2899.119,"duration":3.521},{"text":"like the biggest challenge that you see","start":2901.04,"duration":3.2},{"text":"in that process like where do things get","start":2902.64,"duration":3.36},{"text":"bogged down the most","start":2904.24,"duration":4.48},{"text":"boy um it's interesting we have actually","start":2906.0,"duration":3.52},{"text":"i feel like we're","start":2908.72,"duration":2.56},{"text":"we're finally really getting into a","start":2909.52,"duration":3.12},{"text":"groove and we're getting a lot","start":2911.28,"duration":3.52},{"text":"of features out much much more quickly","start":2912.64,"duration":3.439},{"text":"than we used to and uh","start":2914.8,"duration":4.0},{"text":"i think part of it is just that the two","start":2916.079,"duration":4.0},{"text":"different sides of like","start":2918.8,"duration":4.24},{"text":"the pure researchers slash

complexity of deploying an","start":2929.839,"duration":3.52},{"text":"actual ai product","start":2931.92,"duration":3.439},{"text":"and then you have engineers and the the","start":2933.359,"duration":3.361},{"text":"truth is though that","start":2935.359,"duration":4.881},{"text":"somewhere between five to twenty percent","start":2936.72,"duration":6.399},{"text":"of an ai product is actual ai and then","start":2940.24,"duration":4.8},{"text":"somewhere between 95 to 80","start":2943.119,"duration":4.641},{"text":"it's just relatively standard but still","start":2945.04,"duration":3.6},{"text":"very hard","start":2947.76,"duration":3.52},{"text":"software

cool","start":2960.88,"duration":3.28},{"text":"and and you're super smart and you know","start":2962.0,"duration":3.839},{"text":"ai now and so on","start":2964.16,"duration":3.439},{"text":"but then when you actually want to","start":2965.839,"duration":4.0},{"text":"deploy that in a large context now you","start":2967.599,"duration":2.48},{"text":"have","start":2969.839,"duration":2.321},{"text":"load balancing you have security you","start":2970.079,"duration":3.441},{"text":"have

kaggle","start":240.879,"duration":3.28},{"text":"and then you you take it out to today","start":242.72,"duration":3.12},{"text":"like how much better do","start":244.159,"duration":3.36},{"text":"do people do do they even do better like","start":245.84,"duration":3.119},{"text":"do you think you could win","start":247.519,"duration":2.8},{"text":"could you take modern tools and

is has the feature engineering","start":254.879,"duration":2.48},{"text":"really improved","start":256.16,"duration":3.52},{"text":"so the thing um when kaggle first got","start":257.359,"duration":4.0},{"text":"started um people used to use","start":259.68,"duration":3.36},{"text":"all sorts of things like support vector","start":261.359,"duration":4.481},{"text":"machines self-organizing maps","start":263.04,"duration":4.64},{"text":"you know like really a large range

contribution i think kaggle made is","start":271.04,"duration":4.32},{"text":"we made it very clear that random forest","start":273.28,"duration":3.199},{"text":"was um","start":275.36,"duration":4.72},{"text":"was the best um algorithm for","start":276.479,"duration":5.121},{"text":"actually actually most problems at that","start":280.08,"duration":3.04},{"text":"time um","start":281.6,"duration":4.28},{"text":"and uh and then let's say around the","start":283.12,"duration":6.32},{"text":"2014 2000 and yeah about 2014","start":285.88,"duration":5.24},{"text":"tianki chen at the university of","start":289.44,"duration":3.84},{"text":"washington released xg boost","start":291.12,"duration":4.56},{"text":"um i think it was always thought that","start":293.28,"duration":4.32},{"text":"gradient boosting machines","start":295.68,"duration":4.64},{"text":"should be better you know like like you","start":297.6,"duration":3.2},{"text":"know they're","start":300.32,"duration":2.159},{"text":"it's a very smart approach to ensembling","start":300.8,"duration":3.36},{"text":"decision trees um","start":302.479,"duration":3.761},{"text":"they they should be better um but","start":304.16,"duration":4.319},{"text":"they're very very finicky before xg","start":306.24,"duration":3.36},{"text":"boost and once","start":308.479,"duration":3.521},{"text":"tianki chen launched xg boost it really","start":309.6,"duration":4.08},{"text":"took over from

a","start":321.199,"duration":4.241},{"text":"huge increase but it was enough","start":323.52,"duration":3.92},{"text":"um and so to be honest unstructured data","start":325.44,"duration":3.039},{"text":"problems i think","start":327.44,"duration":4.4},{"text":"that's probably where most of the","start":328.479,"duration":6.881},{"text":"like software driven um improvements","start":331.84,"duration":4.48},{"text":"have come from","start":335.36,"duration":3.6},{"text":"it's probably the case if you took a","start":336.32,"duration":3.92},{"text":"problem from","start":338.96,"duration":3.519},{"text":"the early days of kaggle that was one","start":340.24,"duration":3.6},{"text":"with random

answer","start":345.6,"duration":3.92},{"text":"because of the xg boost i don't actually","start":347.28,"duration":3.04},{"text":"think","start":349.52,"duration":2.399},{"text":"the way people are

think that you would get","start":353.759,"duration":3.841},{"text":"what we always say is that kaggle","start":356.0,"duration":2.96},{"text":"competitions typically","start":357.6,"duration":3.2},{"text":"you know the top teams all converge on","start":358.96,"duration":3.04},{"text":"about the same level of","start":360.8,"duration":2.8},{"text":"level of accuracy and the intuition","start":362.0,"duration":3.759},{"text":"there is there's only so much signal in","start":363.6,"duration":4.4},{"text":"a data set right and so people compete","start":365.759,"duration":3.761},{"text":"to the point where they've extracted all","start":368.0,"duration":3.52},{"text":"the signal um and so","start":369.52,"duration":3.36},{"text":"i believe in the early kaggle","start":371.52,"duration":3.519},{"text":"competitions people always found","start":372.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"that their key features and they got all","start":375.039,"duration":3.201},{"text":"the signal out of the data set","start":376.72,"duration":3.759},{"text":"i think what might happen is um it had","start":378.24,"duration":4.079},{"text":"happened a fair bit faster now","start":380.479,"duration":3.201},{"text":"if you think of professional

people i think the","start":394.08,"duration":3.119},{"text":"difference isn't that the results would","start":395.84,"duration":2.16},{"text":"be better but","start":397.199,"duration":4.161},{"text":"um um the the top performers now would","start":398.0,"duration":5.44},{"text":"get to those results faster","start":401.36,"duration":5.6},{"text":"um is is my guess","start":403.44,"duration":5.68},{"text":"um there are definitely we have um we","start":406.96,"duration":3.44},{"text":"ran a","start":409.12,"duration":3.519},{"text":"challenge with pete warden who's uh now","start":410.4,"duration":3.68},{"text":"at google he was running a company","start":412.639,"duration":3.28},{"text":"called jetback and i think it was a","start":414.08,"duration":3.839},{"text":"distinguish between cats versus dogs i","start":415.919,"duration":3.201},{"text":"think we did that","start":417.919,"duration":3.601},{"text":"if i

cross-validation works","start":794.56,"duration":4.16},{"text":"well if you have a","start":797.12,"duration":4.159},{"text":"there are techniques um as a google","start":798.72,"duration":4.4},{"text":"researcher maurice hart who","start":801.279,"duration":4.081},{"text":"um has a kind of clever approach if you","start":803.12,"duration":3.519},{"text":"have a very small data set","start":805.36,"duration":4.24},{"text":"and um it's difficult to cross

interesting idea","start":830.16,"duration":4.0},{"text":"yeah i mean it's it's i think i think","start":832.24,"duration":3.52},{"text":"cross-validation is still","start":834.16,"duration":3.44},{"text":"the right approach if you have a large","start":835.76,"duration":3.439},{"text":"enough data set um","start":837.6,"duration":3.599},{"text":"and if

that","start":842.88,"duration":3.759},{"text":"um that that allows you to","start":843.6,"duration":6.56},{"text":"um yeah just to still uh prevent against","start":846.639,"duration":4.961},{"text":"overfitting","start":850.16,"duration":3.119},{"text":"interesting also one thing i really","start":851.6,"duration":3.359},{"text":"wanted to ask

kaggle","start":866.88,"duration":3.759},{"text":"grandmasters tend to um do well in the","start":867.519,"duration":4.88},{"text":"real world like do like what parts

learning","start":880.88,"duration":3.519},{"text":"into","start":883.68,"duration":2.8},{"text":"or or building a successful um","start":884.399,"duration":3.361},{"text":"productionized

people","start":1711.12,"duration":3.76},{"text":"use anything besides python and r","start":1712.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"and do people actually like

is","start":1879.84,"duration":3.92},{"text":"this faster training times or literally","start":1881.679,"duration":4.401},{"text":"the models perform better","start":1883.76,"duration":5.36},{"text":"um so one of the reasons that um","start":1886.08,"duration":4.88},{"text":"faster training times matter is because","start":1889.12,"duration":3.76},{"text":"we give people nine hours","start":1890.96,"duration":4.959},{"text":"kaggle notebooks and so um it's","start":1892.88,"duration":4.96},{"text":"so it's faster training times but we","start":1895.919,"duration":3.441},{"text":"give people a lot of people are using","start":1897.84,"duration":3.76},{"text":"our excel our cable notebooks and

we","start":1913.679,"duration":4.0},{"text":"make available have enough memories such","start":1915.919,"duration":2.88},{"text":"that you can train","start":1917.679,"duration":2.641},{"text":"you

looks","start":1974.0,"duration":4.64},{"text":"like yeah but certainly by torch's rise","start":1976.72,"duration":4.64},{"text":"has been very very uh","start":1978.64,"duration":4.8},{"text":"really incredible and what about like","start":1981.36,"duration":3.76},{"text":"the like the simpler","start":1983.44,"duration":3.92},{"text":"this the

ai","start":1995.36,"duration":2.72},{"text":"people quite a lot of people do do that","start":1996.32,"duration":3.12},{"text":"course and then they","start":1998.08,"duration":4.24},{"text":"um

i","start":2116.64,"duration":2.24},{"text":"remember","start":2118.4,"duration":1.92},{"text":"you telling me about it i thought it was","start":2118.88,"duration":4.08},{"text":"um super smart and you you had a","start":2120.32,"duration":4.32},{"text":"um a way of thinking about the jobs that","start":2122.96,"duration":3.28},{"text":"you should be worried about losing","start":2124.64,"duration":3.12},{"text":"so i was hoping you could describe that","start":2126.24,"duration":2.879},{"text":"um to this audience who maybe haven't","start":2127.76,"duration":2.64},{"text":"seen the ted talk but","start":2129.119,"duration":4.401},{"text":"um i also was wondering if your

2016","start":2135.04,"duration":5.44},{"text":"um things have changed a bit yeah","start":2137.28,"duration":4.88},{"text":"at the time maybe it was slightly","start":2140.48,"duration":4.639},{"text":"non-obvious to me it reads now as like","start":2142.16,"duration":6.0},{"text":"very obvious the basic conclusion is

and","start":2246.32,"duration":1.84},{"text":"they'll","start":2247.839,"duration":1.841},{"text":"like they allow us to do a lot of really","start":2248.16,"duration":3.36},{"text":"cool things i just i don't see a path","start":2249.68,"duration":3.2},{"text":"from","start":2251.52,"duration":3.68},{"text":"you know where we are to like a smooth","start":2252.88,"duration":3.12},{"text":"path

to","start":2282.4,"duration":3.36},{"text":"me like do you um","start":2284.079,"duration":4.721},{"text":"have you looked at that yeah i guess um","start":2285.76,"duration":3.52},{"text":"with","start":2288.8,"duration":3.68},{"text":"with um reinforcement learning um where","start":2289.28,"duration":4.799},{"text":"kaggle aims to be is

three","start":2303.92,"duration":4.08},{"text":"weeks ago","start":2306.96,"duration":3.119},{"text":"we launched our second ever uh","start":2308.0,"duration":3.92},{"text":"simulation competition

um our reinforcement learning","start":2328.079,"duration":6.161},{"text":"um you know i have heard of some cool","start":2332.24,"duration":3.68},{"text":"you know pragmatic

where it's really making a","start":2370.88,"duration":2.959},{"text":"positive difference","start":2372.32,"duration":3.84},{"text":"that makes sense all right so we always","start":2373.839,"duration":4.081},{"text":"end it with uh two questions","start":2376.16,"duration":5.28},{"text":"um so the the penultimate question here","start":2377.92,"duration":6.56},{"text":"um is what's the topic um","start":2381.44,"duration":5.36},{"text":"in machine learning that people don't","start":2384.48,"duration":4.48},{"text":"talk about as much as they should","start":2386.8,"duration":3.44},{"text":"i mean one of the things i'm really","start":2388.96,"duration":3.119},{"text":"energized about at the moment","start":2390.24,"duration":3.44},{"text":"just particularly with the success of","start":2392.079,"duration":3.201},{"text":"chemicals data sets platform","start":2393.68,"duration":3.84},{"text":"is um i want to make it easier

the","start":2412.8,"duration":4.0},{"text":"the more powerful our work is going to","start":2414.8,"duration":3.519},{"text":"be and so that's one area","start":2416.8,"duration":3.279},{"text":"um and then the second one is one i","start":2418.319,"duration":3.841},{"text":"mentioned earlier uh gradient boosting","start":2420.079,"duration":2.961},{"text":"machines still","start":2422.16,"duration":3.04},{"text":"do incredibly well in chemical","start":2423.04,"duration":3.92},{"text":"challenges right and it's just not an","start":2425.2,"duration":2.24},{"text":"area","start":2426.96,"duration":3.04},{"text":"of academic study at all and it makes me","start":2427.44,"duration":3.679},{"text":"wonder is there more","start":2430.0,"duration":2.8},{"text":"that could be done you know is that this","start":2431.119,"duration":3.2},{"text":"scenario that's being overlooked is","start":2432.8,"duration":3.6},{"text":"there more that could be done","start":2434.319,"duration":3.681},{"text":"around gradient boosting machine

i've","start":2446.16,"duration":3.04},{"text":"spent the most time with and","start":2447.359,"duration":3.281},{"text":"i remember feeling like they had

it","start":2456.8,"duration":3.519},{"text":"do people add more weak learners to","start":2457.599,"duration":4.321},{"text":"their gradient boosting","start":2460.319,"duration":3.121},{"text":"what

in","start":2481.52,"duration":4.24},{"text":"most cases i","start":2484.72,"duration":3.52},{"text":"i think that it really ensembling

to","start":2488.8,"duration":4.24},{"text":"first","start":2491.68,"duration":3.04},{"text":"but actually when a company looks to","start":2493.04,"duration":3.279},{"text":"productionize a model

so","start":2501.68,"duration":4.88},{"text":"i think gradient boosting machines is","start":2504.96,"duration":3.119},{"text":"really typically","start":2506.56,"duration":5.039},{"text":"enough um on most structures","start":2508.079,"duration":5.681},{"text":"that plus clever feature engineering is","start":2511.599,"duration":4.321},{"text":"enough on most structured data problems","start":2513.76,"duration":3.52},{"text":"got it that's really i'm glad i asked","start":2515.92,"duration":3.919},{"text":"that was interesting um","start":2517.28,"duration":5.76},{"text":"so final question is uh is like when you","start":2519.839,"duration":4.561},{"text":"look at and this is maybe outside of","start":2523.04,"duration":3.12},{"text":"kaggle but like at google and","start":2524.4,"duration":3.12},{"text":"and all the companies that you've

started","start":174.12,"duration":5.19},{"text":"I think two and a half years ago and it","start":177.63,"duration":3.6},{"text":"was basically just out of our own needs","start":179.31,"duration":3.78},{"text":"we were two people that's how MLT","start":181.23,"duration":5.52},{"text":"started and so I'm a domain expert

a","start":188.58,"duration":4.23},{"text":"I'm a trained linguist and I was always","start":190.44,"duration":5.13},{"text":"working with text analysis and NLP I was","start":192.81,"duration":4.8},{"text":"using very simple methods and at some","start":195.57,"duration":3.93},{"text":"point during my Master's I was working","start":197.61,"duration":4.65},{"text":"on sentiment and emotion and effect I","start":199.5,"duration":5.31},{"text":"realized that these kind of very simple","start":202.26,"duration":4.44},{"text":"statistical methods give us like some","start":204.81,"duration":3.48},{"text":"intuition and some insight about a","start":206.7,"duration":4.319},{"text":"corpus about a data set but like","start":208.29,"duration":6.3},{"text":"language is full of like very

and","start":217.86,"duration":5.01},{"text":"sarcasm and you know that's not possible","start":220.709,"duration":5.761},{"text":"to grasp with those very simple tools so","start":222.87,"duration":4.98},{"text":"I think three or four years ago I","start":226.47,"duration":2.579},{"text":"started reading about machine learning","start":227.85,"duration":3.389},{"text":"and deep learning in neural networks and","start":229.049,"duration":4.41},{"text":"I got super hooked and I realized

my","start":245.91,"duration":5.04},{"text":"first machine learning code three years","start":248.79,"duration":3.93},{"text":"ago but I was so realized for like","start":250.95,"duration":3.9},{"text":"coming from a different background it's","start":252.72,"duration":3.54},{"text":"pretty challenging it's pretty difficult","start":254.85,"duration":5.1},{"text":"and for me back then I knew okay I want","start":256.26,"duration":5.219},{"text":"to have this collaborative learning","start":259.95,"duration":4.38},{"text":"environment I need to be surrounded by","start":261.479,"duration":4.921},{"text":"people with different

and","start":269.43,"duration":4.41},{"text":"together or at least that was that was","start":271.53,"duration":4.82},{"text":"what I thought we could learn faster and","start":273.84,"duration":4.829},{"text":"that's exactly what happened so you","start":276.35,"duration":4.3},{"text":"Rajesh my-my co-founder is also coming","start":278.669,"duration":3.361},{"text":"from a different background from an","start":280.65,"duration":3.21},{"text":"electrical engineering hardware","start":282.03,"duration":4.139},{"text":"background and he wanted to use machine","start":283.86,"duration":4.86},{"text":"learning and he still wants to use it","start":286.169,"duration":5.181},{"text":"for edge devices microcontrollers and","start":288.72,"duration":6.09},{"text":"yeah we started very small and we just","start":291.35,"duration":5.319},{"text":"met every week and wrote machine","start":294.81,"duration":3.84},{"text":"learning code and every week more and","start":296.669,"duration":4.021},{"text":"more people joined even though it was","start":298.65,"duration":5.19},{"text":"kind of word-of-mouth and after like a","start":300.69,"duration":4.949},{"text":"few weeks there are so many people we","start":303.84,"duration":3.359},{"text":"didn't know where to put them anymore so","start":305.639,"duration":3.84},{"text":"we met in this open co-working space at","start":307.199,"duration":4.651},{"text":"Yahoo and with too many people so","start":309.479,"duration":3.901},{"text":"everybody wanted to write machine","start":311.85,"duration":4.14},{"text":"learning code and then we started like","start":313.38,"duration":4.259},{"text":"putting out our first meetups and ever","start":315.99,"duration":4.109},{"text":"since it has been growing pretty fast so","start":317.639,"duration":4.771},{"text":"we started from very small but kind of","start":320.099,"duration":5.04},{"text":"you know out of our own need to because","start":322.41,"duration":4.47},{"text":"in Tokyo there was no such thing back","start":325.139,"duration":3.661},{"text":"then like two and a half years ago there","start":326.88,"duration":3.509},{"text":"were a lot of communities like great","start":328.8,"duration":4.56},{"text":"communities but there was no like place","start":330.389,"duration":4.921},{"text":"to actually build a UI there was no","start":333.36,"duration":3.779},{"text":"place to work on hands-on stuff so","start":335.31,"duration":3.84},{"text":"that's how it all started it's so cool","start":337.139,"duration":3.21},{"text":"so you built the community that you","start":339.15,"duration":3.72},{"text":"wanted to to be a part of that's so","start":340.349,"duration":5.281},{"text":"great how did you frame it like when you","start":342.87,"duration":4.919},{"text":"were first I'm saying hey come join me","start":345.63,"duration":4.11},{"text":"what was the the thing to do like it was","start":347.789,"duration":4.201},{"text":"like let's learn ml together or read","start":349.74,"duration":3.859},{"text":"papers or how did you think about that","start":351.99,"duration":5.609},{"text":"so the very first kind of I think first","start":353.599,"duration":6.581},{"text":"six months or so it was purely dedicated","start":357.599,"duration":4.56},{"text":"to going through tutorials so really","start":360.18,"duration":4.35},{"text":"learning about how to write machine","start":362.159,"duration":4.711},{"text":"learning code and learning about you","start":364.53,"duration":4.23},{"text":"know getting a conceptual understanding","start":366.87,"duration":5.07},{"text":"of different algorithms of the math but","start":368.76,"duration":5.46},{"text":"mainly to write code and that was how we","start":371.94,"duration":4.62},{"text":"started is just you know going through","start":374.22,"duration":5.22},{"text":"as much stuff as possible and then once","start":376.56,"duration":6.06},{"text":"we kind of and you know the team grew","start":379.44,"duration":6.12},{"text":"bigger and more people have joined us so","start":382.62,"duration":4.799},{"text":"after six months it kind of slowly","start":385.56,"duration":5.31},{"text":"started to broaden so we did a lot more","start":387.419,"duration":7.11},{"text":"things we did we started doing hands-on","start":390.87,"duration":5.28},{"text":"deep learning workshops in the first","start":394.529,"duration":4.2},{"text":"year so we had deep learning engineers","start":396.15,"duration":3.84},{"text":"who are working as","start":398.729,"duration":3.931},{"text":"who working full-time Japanese companies","start":399.99,"duration":5.13},{"text":"and they were giving five-hour deep","start":402.66,"duration":5.04},{"text":"learning workshops where we focus on","start":405.12,"duration":5.55},{"text":"writing life code from scratch and","start":407.7,"duration":5.37},{"text":"training a specific model of training I","start":410.67,"duration":4.65},{"text":"don't know we we first focused a lot on","start":413.07,"duration":4.41},{"text":"computer vision so we went through a lot","start":415.32,"duration":4.41},{"text":"of computer vision stuff and then","start":417.48,"duration":3.9},{"text":"gradually kind of moved into different","start":419.73,"duration":5.13},{"text":"areas of machine learning and like as","start":421.38,"duration":5.43},{"text":"the community kind of progresses and","start":424.86,"duration":5.34},{"text":"grows we we see that we go in two","start":426.81,"duration":5.73},{"text":"different directions so now we have like","start":430.2,"duration":4.65},{"text":"a computer vision team that the CNN","start":432.54,"duration":4.17},{"text":"architectures and their own little","start":434.85,"duration":4.26},{"text":"ecosystem we have a team that is fully","start":436.71,"duration":4.65},{"text":"dedicated to nji so running deep","start":439.11,"duration":4.85},{"text":"learning algorithms on on Hardware on","start":441.36,"duration":5.97},{"text":"microcontrollers and and devices we have","start":443.96,"duration":5.35},{"text":"an NLP team that does research and","start":447.33,"duration":3.78},{"text":"natural language processing so and","start":449.31,"duration":3.66},{"text":"everything is fully community driven so","start":451.11,"duration":3.84},{"text":"there is no full-time employees or","start":452.97,"duration":3.81},{"text":"anything it's really how the community","start":454.95,"duration":5.16},{"text":"evolves and and grows and that kind of","start":456.78,"duration":4.95},{"text":"broadens in two different directions","start":460.11,"duration":4.35},{"text":"that's impressive so like how do you run","start":461.73,"duration":4.44},{"text":"a good workshop like like a five-hour","start":464.46,"duration":3.33},{"text":"workshop you know I've seen really good","start":466.17,"duration":3.78},{"text":"ones and bad ones like how would you do","start":467.79,"duration":3.18},{"text":"it to make sure that it's a good","start":469.95,"duration":3.6},{"text":"experience for people I think it was","start":470.97,"duration":4.02},{"text":"learning by doing lane and in the","start":473.55,"duration":3.0},{"text":"beginning we really didn't know what we","start":474.99,"duration":4.26},{"text":"were doing so I think two years ago when","start":476.55,"duration":4.11},{"text":"we held our first deep learning","start":479.25,"duration":4.29},{"text":"workshops a lot of things were pretty","start":480.66,"duration":4.97},{"text":"difficult and pretty challenging because","start":483.54,"duration":5.46},{"text":"people come with different machines with","start":485.63,"duration":4.99},{"text":"different skill sets with different","start":489.0,"duration":3.39},{"text":"background knowledge a different","start":490.62,"duration":4.44},{"text":"software and hardware so it was pretty","start":492.39,"duration":6.93},{"text":"difficult but we kind of slowly we got a","start":495.06,"duration":6.21},{"text":"lot of feedback in kind of first","start":499.32,"duration":5.64},{"text":"iterations and worked and work with that","start":501.27,"duration":6.96},{"text":"feedback so things that made it easier","start":504.96,"duration":6.36},{"text":"for us is just you know focus on one","start":508.23,"duration":4.71},{"text":"thing that is really interesting to us","start":511.32,"duration":5.49},{"text":"where we see value that can bring value","start":512.94,"duration":5.67},{"text":"to us as instructors as deep learning","start":516.81,"duration":4.77},{"text":"engineers as well as to the community so","start":518.61,"duration":6.12},{"text":"something that is very useful the second","start":521.58,"duration":4.71},{"text":"thing is like make sure that technically","start":524.73,"duration":3.99},{"text":"everything runs smoothly so we switched","start":526.29,"duration":5.67},{"text":"I think after a second or third workshop","start":528.72,"duration":5.01},{"text":"to Google collab","start":531.96,"duration":3.72},{"text":"that makes it very easy like to just","start":533.73,"duration":4.789},{"text":"write code and there's no like","start":535.68,"duration":5.19},{"text":"prerequisite except for having a gmail","start":538.519,"duration":4.12},{"text":"account but that solves a lot of the","start":540.87,"duration":4.05},{"text":"technical issues and problems that we","start":542.639,"duration":7.021},{"text":"had yeah but it does everybody like Bill","start":544.92,"duration":6.21},{"text":"the same thing together is that how you","start":549.66,"duration":3.119},{"text":"run it so ever it's like you get you","start":551.13,"duration":4.17},{"text":"sort of like like say a problem","start":552.779,"duration":4.231},{"text":"everybody works together like how I","start":555.3,"duration":3.3},{"text":"guess like how much do you kind of","start":557.01,"duration":2.939},{"text":"coordinate like everybody doing the","start":558.6,"duration":2.97},{"text":"exact same thing risk left people going","start":559.949,"duration":4.591},{"text":"off on their own so it depends what kind","start":561.57,"duration":5.459},{"text":"of workshop we're doing so if we have","start":564.54,"duration":4.109},{"text":"our standard deep learning workshop","start":567.029,"duration":4.05},{"text":"there's typically a topic and we already","start":568.649,"duration":5.101},{"text":"have prepared like a repository with the","start":571.079,"duration":4.861},{"text":"model that we're going to build we sit","start":573.75,"duration":4.829},{"text":"down with 50 people we do some theory so","start":575.94,"duration":4.32},{"text":"we do first like maybe an hour of","start":578.579,"duration":3.211},{"text":"conceptual understanding of what is","start":580.26,"duration":3.12},{"text":"going to happen what we're going to","start":581.79,"duration":4.62},{"text":"build and then Dimitri's for example","start":583.38,"duration":6.09},{"text":"he's like he's live coding from scratch","start":586.41,"duration":5.429},{"text":"so he basically walks you through from","start":589.47,"duration":4.38},{"text":"the very beginning to to getting your","start":591.839,"duration":5.821},{"text":"your performance metrics and so this","start":593.85,"duration":5.91},{"text":"these kind of workshops are designed to","start":597.66,"duration":4.35},{"text":"do exactly this only this and people","start":599.76,"duration":4.019},{"text":"just follow along with the code and they","start":602.01,"duration":3.809},{"text":"can live code from scratch and this is","start":603.779,"duration":4.261},{"text":"something that people find really useful","start":605.819,"duration":4.471},{"text":"because especially like kind of D live","start":608.04,"duration":4.14},{"text":"coding aspect because sometimes when","start":610.29,"duration":4.529},{"text":"you're on your own you look at you know","start":612.18,"duration":4.83},{"text":"blocks of code and you're kind of trying","start":614.819,"duration":4.26},{"text":"to figure out what is happening try to","start":617.01,"duration":3.87},{"text":"figure out your own thing but it's","start":619.079,"duration":4.981},{"text":"useful if someone actually writes code","start":620.88,"duration":5.13},{"text":"with you and explains what is happening","start":624.06,"duration":4.649},{"text":"it's you learn just faster probably or","start":626.01,"duration":5.129},{"text":"this is at least what I what I find to","start":628.709,"duration":4.981},{"text":"be useful on the other hand we have much","start":631.139,"duration":5.101},{"text":"more open sessions so especially like","start":633.69,"duration":4.82},{"text":"our hardware sessions where I do edgy

think","start":1114.22,"duration":4.98},{"text":"there's definitely a room for people who","start":1116.59,"duration":4.17},{"text":"are coming from different

look","start":1123.24,"duration":5.47},{"text":"into it what I mean you've probably seen","start":1126.13,"duration":6.02},{"text":"people go from kind of novices to","start":1128.71,"duration":7.23},{"text":"knowing a lot about ml and people ask me","start":1132.15,"duration":6.31},{"text":"all the time kind of how do I get

that","start":1153.73,"duration":4.92},{"text":"you have to start over from zero and you","start":1156.22,"duration":4.62},{"text":"have you you don't know anything

I","start":1435.67,"duration":4.62},{"text":"think the most important thing is to do","start":1437.65,"duration":4.35},{"text":"something that you are really interested","start":1440.29,"duration":3.9},{"text":"in because if you're starting it a lot","start":1442.0,"duration":4.59},{"text":"of things will depend on you and the","start":1444.19,"duration":4.11},{"text":"keys I think somebody wrote it on","start":1446.59,"duration":3.9},{"text":"Twitter recently the key also to MLT is","start":1448.3,"duration":4.98},{"text":"consistency so we consistently just keep","start":1450.49,"duration":5.37},{"text":"doing stuff that that we think is","start":1453.28,"duration":5.04},{"text":"exciting and interesting so start from","start":1455.86,"duration":4.5},{"text":"what you're interested in start from","start":1458.32,"duration":6.33},{"text":"your own problem set or from your own","start":1460.36,"duration":7.53},{"text":"need and more people will follow","start":1464.65,"duration":6.69},{"text":"and then like more practical things you","start":1467.89,"duration":5.64},{"text":"know there's always the thing we started","start":1471.34,"duration":4.95},{"text":"doing remote you know so that there is","start":1473.53,"duration":5.73},{"text":"not the kind of burden of having to find","start":1476.29,"duration":5.4},{"text":"a venue and a sponsor and other things","start":1479.26,"duration":4.65},{"text":"so this is an option how to kick things","start":1481.69,"duration":4.11},{"text":"off to find more people who are","start":1483.91,"duration":5.22},{"text":"interested that makes it very easy like","start":1485.8,"duration":5.25},{"text":"making that there's no easier way","start":1489.13,"duration":3.96},{"text":"probably than to start like remote","start":1491.05,"duration":4.32},{"text":"meetups on the other hand if you want to","start":1493.09,"duration":4.62},{"text":"start something in your city you you","start":1495.37,"duration":4.65},{"text":"might want to check out like first of","start":1497.71,"duration":4.77},{"text":"all like form a small peer group around","start":1500.02,"duration":4.02},{"text":"yourself and kind of try to figure out","start":1502.48,"duration":3.78},{"text":"what you want to do and then start to","start":1504.04,"duration":4.92},{"text":"look for a physical place and figure out","start":1506.26,"duration":4.74},{"text":"if you want to do hands-on stuff if you","start":1508.96,"duration":4.08},{"text":"want to do like more educational stuff","start":1511.0,"duration":4.86},{"text":"learn together and get it out there like","start":1513.04,"duration":4.32},{"text":"try to reach as many people as possible","start":1515.86,"duration":4.92},{"text":"and I think you know I just yesterday I","start":1517.36,"duration":5.7},{"text":"talked to someone a journalist and he","start":1520.78,"duration":4.77},{"text":"said to me wow there's no such thing for","start":1523.06,"duration":4.05},{"text":"writers out there I want to start","start":1525.55,"duration":3.45},{"text":"something for writers out there and I","start":1527.11,"duration":3.6},{"text":"think it's kind of the same thing right","start":1529.0,"duration":4.08},{"text":"there's a need for all these news groups","start":1530.71,"duration":7.14},{"text":"and and and communities so I think if","start":1533.08,"duration":6.24},{"text":"you get it out there and if you do","start":1537.85,"duration":2.91},{"text":"things that you're very passionate about","start":1539.32,"duration":3.96},{"text":"people will follow do you have any","start":1540.76,"duration":5.94},{"text":"thoughts on like diversity and inclusion","start":1543.28,"duration":5.97},{"text":"and m\/l and in these groups that you","start":1546.7,"duration":4.77},{"text":"create is that something that is top of","start":1549.25,"duration":4.32},{"text":"mind for you yeah that's something that","start":1551.47,"duration":4.32},{"text":"is very important to us luckily within","start":1553.57,"duration":5.22},{"text":"within MLT we're we're very diverse

do","start":1582.49,"duration":5.07},{"text":"something about that so we're doing like","start":1584.71,"duration":5.4},{"text":"very specific not only events but also","start":1587.56,"duration":5.31},{"text":"projects that support diversity and","start":1590.11,"duration":4.71},{"text":"inclusion we do a lot of women

of","start":1622.959,"duration":4.32},{"text":"seems like there's a disconnect between","start":1625.509,"duration":4.65},{"text":"between a Japanese community and an","start":1627.279,"duration":5.46},{"text":"english-speaking community and I think","start":1630.159,"duration":4.47},{"text":"it has never been more important we all","start":1632.739,"duration":3.54},{"text":"know like Tech in general is","start":1634.629,"duration":4.62},{"text":"multidisciplinary machine

this","start":1646.809,"duration":4.32},{"text":"is something we all have to work on I","start":1649.57,"duration":4.169},{"text":"think do you have any other suggestions","start":1651.129,"duration":4.26},{"text":"for making a community feel more","start":1653.739,"duration":7.34},{"text":"inclusive so in our core team we decided","start":1655.389,"duration":9.301},{"text":"very early on that we we want to create","start":1661.079,"duration":6.19},{"text":"an environment that is very","start":1664.69,"duration":5.099},{"text":"collaborative and that is very inclusive","start":1667.269,"duration":8.37},{"text":"that means that we really want to don't","start":1669.789,"duration":8.19},{"text":"have this as as kind of this elite math","start":1675.639,"duration":5.34},{"text":"machine learning group we want to","start":1677.979,"duration":5.63},{"text":"include as many people as possible and","start":1680.979,"duration":6.68},{"text":"we want to have like decision processes","start":1683.609,"duration":6.52},{"text":"we want to have the community involved","start":1687.659,"duration":4.6},{"text":"in like what directions we take what","start":1690.129,"duration":4.59},{"text":"kind of what kind of things we're","start":1692.259,"duration":6.811},{"text":"tackling on next and we do like every","start":1694.719,"duration":6.45},{"text":"project that we do in every workshop in","start":1699.07,"duration":4.62},{"text":"every study session we kind of have that","start":1701.169,"duration":4.95},{"text":"sort of mindset so when you look at our","start":1703.69,"duration":4.319},{"text":"math sessions so last year we started","start":1706.119,"duration":4.5},{"text":"doing remote math reading sessions so","start":1708.009,"duration":7.08},{"text":"we're going through a book that walks","start":1710.619,"duration":7.17},{"text":"you through some machine learning math","start":1715.089,"duration":5.94},{"text":"and the so more than 1,000 people signed","start":1717.789,"duration":5.04},{"text":"up from all over the world so we have","start":1721.029,"duration":4.53},{"text":"Russians in in in the Bay Area we have","start":1722.829,"duration":5.25},{"text":"sessions in India in APEC here in Japan","start":1725.559,"duration":6.57},{"text":"and the thing is it is very inclusive","start":1728.079,"duration":6.811},{"text":"because the sessions the people that","start":1732.129,"duration":5.281},{"text":"those sessions their levels of math are","start":1734.89,"duration":4.83},{"text":"very different so we have complete","start":1737.41,"duration":3.93},{"text":"beginners we have people that coming","start":1739.72,"duration":2.91},{"text":"from completely different backgrounds","start":1741.34,"duration":4.11},{"text":"but in our Tokyo sessions we also have","start":1742.63,"duration":5.01},{"text":"mathematicians we have experts we have","start":1745.45,"duration":5.1},{"text":"PhDs in math people that have taught","start":1747.64,"duration":6.06},{"text":"math for many years and it's it's pretty","start":1750.55,"duration":5.09},{"text":"amazing like it's a very interactive","start":1753.7,"duration":3.81},{"text":"after the reading it's a very","start":1755.64,"duration":3.82},{"text":"interactive discussion where people ask","start":1757.51,"duration":4.02},{"text":"all sorts of questions and together we","start":1759.46,"duration":4.59},{"text":"kind of brainstorm around things and try","start":1761.53,"duration":5.25},{"text":"to are experts like ml and Jason they","start":1764.05,"duration":6.06},{"text":"try to explain mathematical concepts and","start":1766.78,"duration":4.98},{"text":"it's been pretty amazing so I think","start":1770.11,"duration":4.17},{"text":"really having this mindset whatever you","start":1771.76,"duration":5.58},{"text":"do that you need this it's not like it's","start":1774.28,"duration":5.25},{"text":"something that is actually enriching","start":1777.34,"duration":3.72},{"text":"whatever you do is something that is","start":1779.53,"duration":3.0},{"text":"very important and having that mindset","start":1781.06,"duration":4.89},{"text":"is probably going to help a lot what's","start":1782.53,"duration":10.68},{"text":"super cool that sounds really fun what","start":1785.95,"duration":9.78},{"text":"is something underrated maybe in machine","start":1793.21,"duration":3.99},{"text":"learning that you think people don't pay","start":1795.73,"duration":4.32},{"text":"enough attention to I think something","start":1797.2,"duration":5.46},{"text":"still underrated and machine learning is","start":1800.05,"duration":5.79},{"text":"data um but still oh my god yeah I think","start":1802.66,"duration":3.72},{"text":"so","start":1805.84,"duration":2.1},{"text":"like it doesn't matter who I talk to","start":1806.38,"duration":3.78},{"text":"it's like always I feel like there's","start":1807.94,"duration":5.79},{"text":"some it's kind of it's a

of","start":1824.71,"duration":3.84},{"text":"Dilys and that people think about","start":1827.05,"duration":7.05},{"text":"sometimes or these kind of my my","start":1828.55,"duration":7.17},{"text":"understanding of it and I think we","start":1834.1,"duration":4.17},{"text":"should definitely think more about data","start":1835.72,"duration":6.63},{"text":"and put more emphasis on data maybe this","start":1838.27,"duration":5.43},{"text":"is also because of my own background","start":1842.35,"duration":2.7},{"text":"because I've been working with data","start":1843.7,"duration":4.26},{"text":"pretty much all my own my career and","start":1845.05,"duration":5.19},{"text":"just three years ago started working","start":1847.96,"duration":4.47},{"text":"with machine learning algorithms but","start":1850.24,"duration":4.77},{"text":"yeah it all starts with data and it'll","start":1852.43,"duration":4.56},{"text":"probably ends with data I think cheap UN","start":1855.01,"duration":4.41},{"text":"just mentioned recently who who owns the","start":1856.99,"duration":4.74},{"text":"data pipeline will own the machine","start":1859.42,"duration":3.96},{"text":"learning and production or the machine","start":1861.73,"duration":4.38},{"text":"learning system I guess I don't know if","start":1863.38,"duration":4.44},{"text":"it's still that case maybe an SF","start":1866.11,"duration":4.35},{"text":"in the Bay Area people think more about","start":1867.82,"duration":5.309},{"text":"data I don't know I don't know I mean I","start":1870.46,"duration":5.149},{"text":"am kind of similar to yours and so I","start":1873.129,"duration":5.191},{"text":"feel like that is so unbelievably","start":1875.609,"duration":5.14},{"text":"important I guess yeah awesome we'll for","start":1878.32,"duration":4.409},{"text":"it to be properly rated for its","start":1880.749,"duration":5.581},{"text":"contribution to well cool and then when","start":1882.729,"duration":4.591},{"text":"you think about like kind of making","start":1886.33,"duration":2.25},{"text":"machine learning work in the real

to","start":1891.82,"duration":5.099},{"text":"work so in our case we love to","start":1893.649,"duration":5.45},{"text":"experiment with new things and I think","start":1896.919,"duration":4.11},{"text":"you know it's difficult when you're","start":1899.099,"duration":3.58},{"text":"trying new things you kind of need to","start":1901.029,"duration":4.5},{"text":"figure out a lot of stuff and generally","start":1902.679,"duration":5.13},{"text":"I think in production environments","start":1905.529,"duration":5.941},{"text":"there's a lot of experimenting and try","start":1907.809,"duration":5.61},{"text":"to see what works so making a

where","start":1960.46,"duration":6.569},{"text":"we're not working on we do work on","start":1963.609,"duration":5.43},{"text":"production things as well but it's not","start":1967.029,"duration":3.691},{"text":"our main thing our main thing is just","start":1969.039,"duration":4.2},{"text":"trying out new things experimenting and","start":1970.72,"duration":5.99},{"text":"make POCs so and we don't actually","start":1973.239,"duration":6.0},{"text":"deploy a lot of things on a large scale","start":1976.71,"duration":5.11},{"text":"to production so maybe I can talk about","start":1979.239,"duration":5.28},{"text":"like the the main challenges here but","start":1981.82,"duration":5.969},{"text":"what I can say is that that we we try","start":1984.519,"duration":7.11},{"text":"like if we take edge for example we're","start":1987.789,"duration":5.64},{"text":"trying out a lot of things we're working","start":1991.629,"duration":3.63},{"text":"with different hardware where we're","start":1993.429,"duration":3.391},{"text":"trying to think about different use","start":1995.259,"duration":3.54},{"text":"cases where these things can be deployed","start":1996.82,"duration":4.35},{"text":"and like a lot of things","start":1998.799,"duration":5.491},{"text":"you know just don't work out and fail","start":2001.17,"duration":5.55},{"text":"but that's totally fine that's that's","start":2004.29,"duration":4.35},{"text":"good as well this is something that we","start":2006.72,"duration":4.23},{"text":"kind of also need to grow and to figure","start":2008.64,"duration":4.74},{"text":"out things but then at the same time we","start":2010.95,"duration":4.17},{"text":"also build things that work and that are","start":2013.38,"duration":4.5},{"text":"super interesting so yeah it's a lot of","start":2015.12,"duration":6.45},{"text":"experimenting I guess yeah make sense","start":2017.88,"duration":7.49},{"text":"okay so my final question yeah if I am","start":2021.57,"duration":5.79},{"text":"listening you talk and I get excited","start":2025.37,"duration":4.15},{"text":"about you know joining one of

also","start":2068.85,"duration":4.319},{"text":"find people there to work on projects","start":2071.13,"duration":4.47},{"text":"and do other things and so these are","start":2073.169,"duration":4.471},{"text":"kind of the main two things the meetup","start":2075.6,"duration":4.47},{"text":"for for events and maybe slack for

you","start":67.36,"duration":3.119},{"text":"um","start":69.439,"duration":2.561},{"text":"i don't think i've ever been part of a","start":70.479,"duration":3.201},{"text":"team with such

kind of break","start":77.28,"duration":4.24},{"text":"that problem down to constituent parts","start":79.52,"duration":4.0},{"text":"like how you think about what the","start":81.52,"duration":4.239},{"text":"you know like weekly kpi should be when","start":83.52,"duration":4.239},{"text":"you have this gigantic goal","start":85.759,"duration":4.481},{"text":"no honestly like this is this feels for","start":87.759,"duration":3.04},{"text":"me like","start":90.24,"duration":2.48},{"text":"uh how i've always worked i don't know","start":90.799,"duration":3.121},{"text":"why because","start":92.72,"duration":2.48},{"text":"i guess like you know i started my","start":93.92,"duration":3.839},{"text":"career at windows and it was like a","start":95.2,"duration":4.239},{"text":"few by the time i left it was like you","start":97.759,"duration":3.601},{"text":"know well into tens of thousands of","start":99.439,"duration":3.201},{"text":"people working in","start":101.36,"duration":3.68},{"text":"and so all working towards one product","start":102.64,"duration":4.56},{"text":"singular focus on one product right","start":105.04,"duration":4.719},{"text":"so it's this is obviously way smaller","start":107.2,"duration":4.4},{"text":"than uh what windows was but it's the","start":109.759,"duration":3.04},{"text":"same idea","start":111.6,"duration":4.159},{"text":"and so now it's a good question like","start":112.799,"duration":4.481},{"text":"what does it mean and how does it break","start":115.759,"duration":2.4},{"text":"down","start":117.28,"duration":4.479},{"text":"so usually in a project like this","start":118.159,"duration":5.761},{"text":"um you're gonna have so many different","start":121.759,"duration":4.4},{"text":"skill sets so ml is just one of them","start":123.92,"duration":3.28},{"text":"usually when people think about","start":126.159,"duration":2.72},{"text":"self-driving cars like they mostly think","start":127.2,"duration":3.44},{"text":"about like the ai part of it","start":128.879,"duration":4.321},{"text":"but uh the way we kind of think about it","start":130.64,"duration":3.28},{"text":"is that","start":133.2,"duration":2.56},{"text":"you're gonna have so first of all you","start":133.92,"duration":3.36},{"text":"have to kind of think about the","start":135.76,"duration":4.32},{"text":"work that we do as in two parts the work","start":137.28,"duration":3.92},{"text":"that happens in the cloud","start":140.08,"duration":3.12},{"text":"the work that happens in the car right","start":141.2,"duration":3.6},{"text":"the code that runs in the car and code","start":143.2,"duration":2.96},{"text":"that runs in the cloud","start":144.8,"duration":4.24},{"text":"and the code that runs in the car you","start":146.16,"duration":4.159},{"text":"can think about it as","start":149.04,"duration":3.12},{"text":"if you really want to simplify it like","start":150.319,"duration":3.361},{"text":"it's kind of","start":152.16,"duration":4.48},{"text":"uh two parts or maybe three parts so at","start":153.68,"duration":4.559},{"text":"the lowest level you have the operating","start":156.64,"duration":3.2},{"text":"system so again if you want to compare","start":158.239,"duration":2.72},{"text":"it with like say","start":159.84,"duration":3.6},{"text":"uh traditional development environment","start":160.959,"duration":4.0},{"text":"like you know imagine you have your","start":163.44,"duration":3.2},{"text":"os that you're targeting and on top of","start":164.959,"duration":3.841},{"text":"that os there will be a run time","start":166.64,"duration":3.36},{"text":"that you're gonna write you know if it's","start":168.8,"duration":2.96},{"text":"android it's like java or whatever right","start":170.0,"duration":3.28},{"text":"so there'll be an equivalent runtime","start":171.76,"duration":2.32},{"text":"that you want","start":173.28,"duration":2.239},{"text":"and then on top of the runtime you'll","start":174.08,"duration":2.96},{"text":"have your app applications right that's","start":175.519,"duration":2.961},{"text":"how you would write a typical one","start":177.04,"duration":3.119},{"text":"so it's a similar idea here so you have","start":178.48,"duration":3.36},{"text":"your os","start":180.159,"duration":3.921},{"text":"that is running on the car hardware uh","start":181.84,"duration":3.679},{"text":"now the car hardware is way more","start":184.08,"duration":2.64},{"text":"complicated than anything that like","start":185.519,"duration":3.281},{"text":"you've seen on the phones or pcs","start":186.72,"duration":3.84},{"text":"itself we call we say it's like a data","start":188.8,"duration":3.12},{"text":"center on wheels","start":190.56,"duration":4.08},{"text":"uh so this typically a car has a lot of","start":191.92,"duration":5.28},{"text":"computers in it but the ones that","start":194.64,"duration":4.0},{"text":"some of them we write software for some","start":197.2,"duration":3.44},{"text":"of them are like come with the car","start":198.64,"duration":4.64},{"text":"and they're all in a gigantic network so","start":200.64,"duration":3.76},{"text":"you run","start":203.28,"duration":4.0},{"text":"so the most of the code that we write","start":204.4,"duration":3.68},{"text":"runs on","start":207.28,"duration":3.679},{"text":"what we call high performance compute","start":208.08,"duration":3.68},{"text":"but again","start":210.959,"duration":2.321},{"text":"different companies rooting different","start":211.76,"duration":3.839},{"text":"things like so they will all","start":213.28,"duration":4.08},{"text":"maybe they will factor the workload in","start":215.599,"duration":3.441},{"text":"different ways so you know like you can","start":217.36,"duration":2.4},{"text":"imagine","start":219.04,"duration":3.279},{"text":"the multiple smaller computers or one","start":219.76,"duration":4.0},{"text":"large computer and one small computer","start":222.319,"duration":2.56},{"text":"there's different configurations","start":223.76,"duration":2.72},{"text":"possible","start":224.879,"duration":3.201},{"text":"and you just have to figure out how","start":226.48,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you're going to break down your workload","start":228.08,"duration":3.76},{"text":"and then on each of those computers like","start":229.92,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you're going to run like","start":231.84,"duration":4.16},{"text":"a fairly depending on how big it is like","start":233.36,"duration":4.159},{"text":"you're going to run a fairly beefy","start":236.0,"duration":3.439},{"text":"operating system or","start":237.519,"duration":4.08},{"text":"possibly even like no operating system","start":239.439,"duration":4.321},{"text":"if it is like a microcontroller","start":241.599,"duration":5.041},{"text":"and uh and then uh sometimes like","start":243.76,"duration":4.559},{"text":"there'll be embedded uh","start":246.64,"duration":3.28},{"text":"processors and then you'll run a very","start":248.319,"duration":3.601},{"text":"very thin micro kernel","start":249.92,"duration":4.72},{"text":"and then on top of that uh you we have","start":251.92,"duration":4.719},{"text":"like a framework that we build","start":254.64,"duration":4.48},{"text":"uh that's basically enables uh","start":256.639,"duration":3.84},{"text":"components that are the software","start":259.12,"duration":2.72},{"text":"components that are running on","start":260.479,"duration":3.601},{"text":"that one computer to work with each","start":261.84,"duration":4.48},{"text":"other a good equivalent of that is in","start":264.08,"duration":3.679},{"text":"the open source world you would have run","start":266.32,"duration":2.8},{"text":"into something called ross","start":267.759,"duration":4.801},{"text":"so yeah very similar to that and then uh","start":269.12,"duration":4.799},{"text":"but you can imagine they can also","start":272.56,"duration":3.04},{"text":"communicate across the computers on the","start":273.919,"duration":2.881},{"text":"network","start":275.6,"duration":4.48},{"text":"and then on top of that you write your","start":276.8,"duration":5.52},{"text":"uh the functionality that actually makes","start":280.08,"duration":3.839},{"text":"it autonomous but then you can imagine","start":282.32,"duration":3.36},{"text":"like that's just one but you could also","start":283.919,"duration":3.201},{"text":"have a calibration functionality there's","start":285.68,"duration":2.16},{"text":"a bunch of other","start":287.12,"duration":2.16},{"text":"little pieces of functionality that you","start":287.84,"duration":3.84},{"text":"would write uh but the autonomous itself","start":289.28,"duration":4.0},{"text":"kind of breaks down into your classical","start":291.68,"duration":4.48},{"text":"robotics paradigm right sense plan","start":293.28,"duration":5.44},{"text":"act so sensing is basically what in our","start":296.16,"duration":4.319},{"text":"world we call it perception","start":298.72,"duration":4.88},{"text":"uh then you have a block","start":300.479,"duration":5.28},{"text":"of code that predicts how the world is","start":303.6,"duration":3.52},{"text":"going to change","start":305.759,"duration":3.201},{"text":"and uh there's a block of code that","start":307.12,"duration":3.12},{"text":"basically","start":308.96,"duration":3.6},{"text":"figures out where i i am within the","start":310.24,"duration":3.12},{"text":"world","start":312.56,"duration":2.4},{"text":"with within the world it's called","start":313.36,"duration":3.36},{"text":"localization then there's another block","start":314.96,"duration":2.64},{"text":"of code","start":316.72,"duration":2.319},{"text":"once it knows okay this is what the","start":317.6,"duration":3.28},{"text":"world looks like this is where i am at","start":319.039,"duration":4.72},{"text":"and this is how the world is going to","start":320.88,"duration":4.56},{"text":"change in the next few seconds","start":323.759,"duration":4.88},{"text":"how am i going to act and uh what's the","start":325.44,"duration":4.08},{"text":"plan","start":328.639,"duration":2.4},{"text":"and then it sends it down to the","start":329.52,"duration":3.84},{"text":"actuators um and that's the control part","start":331.039,"duration":3.041},{"text":"of it","start":333.36,"duration":3.36},{"text":"so so all of those all so those are all","start":334.08,"duration":4.32},{"text":"the kind of components that work","start":336.72,"duration":4.4},{"text":"on the car and now there's a lot of code","start":338.4,"duration":4.48},{"text":"that actually runs on the cloud","start":341.12,"duration":4.96},{"text":"um for development reasons as well as uh","start":342.88,"duration":5.44},{"text":"like even during deployment like you do","start":346.08,"duration":3.76},{"text":"um so","start":348.32,"duration":3.52},{"text":"there are teams that actually build the","start":349.84,"duration":3.84},{"text":"infrastructure because","start":351.84,"duration":3.44},{"text":"even though we are part of lyft and lyft","start":353.68,"duration":3.6},{"text":"is like a very much a cloud company","start":355.28,"duration":4.56},{"text":"uh the kind of workloads that the ride","start":357.28,"duration":4.16},{"text":"sharing part of lyft does is very","start":359.84,"duration":2.96},{"text":"different than the kind of workloads","start":361.44,"duration":2.319},{"text":"that we run","start":362.8,"duration":3.28},{"text":"right so the amount of data that we","start":363.759,"duration":4.0},{"text":"collect or the amount of compute that we","start":366.08,"duration":2.399},{"text":"need is","start":367.759,"duration":4.401},{"text":"very very uh at a different scale and uh","start":368.479,"duration":5.121},{"text":"requirements tend to be very different","start":372.16,"duration":3.44},{"text":"so we have a teams that","start":373.6,"duration":5.28},{"text":"actually think about what's the data uh","start":375.6,"duration":6.319},{"text":"the the data part of that infrastructure","start":378.88,"duration":4.64},{"text":"and there are teams that think about the","start":381.919,"duration":3.681},{"text":"compute part of the infrastructure","start":383.52,"duration":4.72},{"text":"um and then we also have to think about","start":385.6,"duration":4.08},{"text":"testing all of these","start":388.24,"duration":4.48},{"text":"so testing obviously you cannot a unit","start":389.68,"duration":3.44},{"text":"test","start":392.72,"duration":2.0},{"text":"you'll do whatever with your code but","start":393.12,"duration":3.76},{"text":"then there's also the other side of the","start":394.72,"duration":3.199},{"text":"testing which is like","start":396.88,"duration":4.08},{"text":"on the road you build everything and","start":397.919,"duration":4.481},{"text":"deploy it but then there's a whole lot","start":400.96,"duration":2.799},{"text":"of other testing that needs to happen in","start":402.4,"duration":2.239},{"text":"between so","start":403.759,"duration":4.401},{"text":"simulation is one example where you try","start":404.639,"duration":4.4},{"text":"to run","start":408.16,"duration":2.4},{"text":"the software that you built that you","start":409.039,"duration":3.44},{"text":"will eventually deploy on your car","start":410.56,"duration":5.359},{"text":"uh somewhere in the cloud and then you","start":412.479,"duration":6.0},{"text":"we also have uh rigs that we build these","start":415.919,"duration":3.041},{"text":"are called","start":418.479,"duration":2.961},{"text":"uh we call them test beds but you know","start":418.96,"duration":4.32},{"text":"another term that you will often hear is","start":421.44,"duration":3.44},{"text":"hardware in the loop testing","start":423.28,"duration":4.8},{"text":"so you build depending on which team it","start":424.88,"duration":4.08},{"text":"is like you know","start":428.08,"duration":2.64},{"text":"you like embedded team will build their","start":428.96,"duration":3.12},{"text":"own like smaller versions","start":430.72,"duration":3.52},{"text":"of hardware uh then there will be full","start":432.08,"duration":3.28},{"text":"system tests","start":434.24,"duration":2.56},{"text":"so there are different types of these","start":435.36,"duration":3.52},{"text":"test beds that we build","start":436.8,"duration":4.56},{"text":"and you can think think of them as like","start":438.88,"duration":4.4},{"text":"mini data centers that we have","start":441.36,"duration":5.36},{"text":"and you run the code on those as well so","start":443.28,"duration":5.56},{"text":"um we treat them as if it's like another","start":446.72,"duration":3.84},{"text":"cloud","start":448.84,"duration":4.44},{"text":"and so we have teams that do all of that","start":450.56,"duration":3.84},{"text":"and then there's a teams","start":453.28,"duration":3.759},{"text":"teams that work on simulation so all of","start":454.4,"duration":4.48},{"text":"these things eventually come together in","start":457.039,"duration":3.6},{"text":"the end of the day like it all gets","start":458.88,"duration":3.52},{"text":"packaged up into software that is","start":460.639,"duration":3.68},{"text":"deployed on the co in the car","start":462.4,"duration":3.6},{"text":"and then we test that car on the road","start":464.319,"duration":3.361},{"text":"and then those metrics","start":466.0,"duration":5.28},{"text":"are used to drive work","start":467.68,"duration":5.12},{"text":"on the software that runs on the car but","start":471.28,"duration":3.359},{"text":"quite often it can also impact","start":472.8,"duration":3.36},{"text":"stuff that happens in the cloud like for","start":474.639,"duration":3.041},{"text":"example if you change your sensor and","start":476.16,"duration":3.439},{"text":"you capture a lot more data","start":477.68,"duration":5.6},{"text":"uh per hour that means you may have to","start":479.599,"duration":6.32},{"text":"potentially replan like uh your uh","start":483.28,"duration":4.24},{"text":"storage capacity","start":485.919,"duration":4.081},{"text":"right now so things like that so so i","start":487.52,"duration":3.6},{"text":"mean i don't know did i answer your","start":490.0,"duration":2.16},{"text":"question there","start":491.12,"duration":2.72},{"text":"well i have so many more questions","start":492.16,"duration":3.28},{"text":"actually yeah i think","start":493.84,"duration":3.44},{"text":"i've been thinking like i guess you're","start":495.44,"duration":3.199},{"text":"at the point where","start":497.28,"duration":3.28},{"text":"you sort of have you probably have some","start":498.639,"duration":3.84},{"text":"metric like how long you can drive","start":500.56,"duration":3.52},{"text":"without intervention that you're trying","start":502.479,"duration":2.641},{"text":"to","start":504.08,"duration":3.839},{"text":"optimize for something like that um and","start":505.12,"duration":3.359},{"text":"then","start":507.919,"duration":2.081},{"text":"but then do you like break it down by","start":508.479,"duration":3.44},{"text":"teams of like we need to make our","start":510.0,"duration":4.08},{"text":"like perception ten percent better or","start":511.919,"duration":3.36},{"text":"something like that or how do you think","start":514.08,"duration":2.16},{"text":"about that","start":515.279,"duration":3.76},{"text":"yeah yeah yeah so we each team has so it","start":516.24,"duration":4.08},{"text":"kind of breaks down right like so","start":519.039,"duration":2.56},{"text":"there's a top-level metric","start":520.32,"duration":3.68},{"text":"for the overall system performance and","start":521.599,"duration":3.521},{"text":"then uh","start":524.0,"duration":2.56},{"text":"do i have that right is it like time","start":525.12,"duration":2.96},{"text":"between intervention or how is that the","start":526.56,"duration":2.719},{"text":"right metric too","start":528.08,"duration":4.4},{"text":"so california dmv reporting that's what","start":529.279,"duration":6.081},{"text":"they look at like so they look at it","start":532.48,"duration":3.84},{"text":"it's called mpi","start":535.36,"duration":2.96},{"text":"miles per intervention so how many miles","start":536.32,"duration":3.199},{"text":"do you drive before you","start":538.32,"duration":2.959},{"text":"you have an intervention so that's a","start":539.519,"duration":4.32},{"text":"very common metric that people track","start":541.279,"duration":4.56},{"text":"but the um but then there are so many","start":543.839,"duration":3.281},{"text":"other metrics that you have to think","start":545.839,"duration":2.881},{"text":"about like you know end-to-end latency","start":547.12,"duration":2.719},{"text":"is one example","start":548.72,"duration":3.2},{"text":"how long does it take from say the time","start":549.839,"duration":4.161},{"text":"you your camera captured a frame","start":551.92,"duration":4.64},{"text":"till the time that you reacted to it so","start":554.0,"duration":3.2},{"text":"one example","start":556.56,"duration":2.16},{"text":"right so you have to think there's a","start":557.2,"duration":3.6},{"text":"number of other metrics that matter","start":558.72,"duration":3.6},{"text":"but of course you can argue that all of","start":560.8,"duration":3.76},{"text":"them come down into an intervention like","start":562.32,"duration":4.56},{"text":"some human had to intervene","start":564.56,"duration":4.08},{"text":"so that's kind of how like you know","start":566.88,"duration":3.519},{"text":"generally the industry is standardized","start":568.64,"duration":2.879},{"text":"around today but","start":570.399,"duration":2.88},{"text":"you know it's very controversial because","start":571.519,"duration":3.121},{"text":"what is an intervention how do you","start":573.279,"duration":3.68},{"text":"report","start":574.64,"duration":2.319},{"text":"but then we internally we track a number","start":579.12,"duration":3.52},{"text":"of other","start":581.92,"duration":3.359},{"text":"like broader system level metrics and","start":582.64,"duration":4.319},{"text":"you can do two things one is like you","start":585.279,"duration":3.201},{"text":"can apportion","start":586.959,"duration":4.081},{"text":"let's say you do mpi right the miles per","start":588.48,"duration":4.4},{"text":"intervention you could apportion","start":591.04,"duration":3.6},{"text":"mpi to different components and say like","start":592.88,"duration":3.12},{"text":"hey uh was","start":594.64,"duration":3.04},{"text":"that the reason the intervention","start":596.0,"duration":3.12},{"text":"happened because we misperceived","start":597.68,"duration":2.96},{"text":"was the reason the intervention happened","start":599.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"because our map was wrong right we kind","start":600.64,"duration":4.319},{"text":"of apportioned those so and then","start":602.48,"duration":4.4},{"text":"they kind of go down as far as they can","start":604.959,"duration":3.041},{"text":"go around that's it","start":606.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"right but then really that's just only","start":608.0,"duration":3.839},{"text":"part of the problem so","start":610.72,"duration":3.119},{"text":"each m each component will also have its","start":611.839,"duration":4.321},{"text":"own separate metric like so","start":613.839,"duration":5.44},{"text":"perception for example uh they may want","start":616.16,"duration":5.2},{"text":"to track like uh the","start":619.279,"duration":4.56},{"text":"precision and recall of seeing different","start":621.36,"duration":3.52},{"text":"agents","start":623.839,"duration":3.041},{"text":"um uh what's the position to recall for","start":624.88,"duration":3.28},{"text":"seeing say","start":626.88,"duration":4.24},{"text":"a pedestrian or a car or a bus and then","start":628.16,"duration":3.919},{"text":"you can further like","start":631.12,"duration":3.04},{"text":"subdivide that like what do how good is","start":632.079,"duration":3.921},{"text":"my position slash recall","start":634.16,"duration":4.64},{"text":"at uh 50 meters at 100 meters you know","start":636.0,"duration":4.32},{"text":"like 500 meters you know so you","start":638.8,"duration":4.64},{"text":"kind of have to uh so there's lots and","start":640.32,"duration":4.72},{"text":"lots of metrics that eventually break","start":643.44,"duration":4.24},{"text":"down at the component","start":645.04,"duration":4.96},{"text":"it comes down to it every component and","start":647.68,"duration":4.08},{"text":"how how do you allocate your resources","start":650.0,"duration":3.6},{"text":"like is the perception team a lot bigger","start":651.76,"duration":3.519},{"text":"than the planning team or like what's","start":653.6,"duration":2.32},{"text":"the","start":655.279,"duration":2.961},{"text":"like roughly like where that's a very","start":655.92,"duration":3.359},{"text":"good question","start":658.24,"duration":4.96},{"text":"uh i'd say like um","start":659.279,"duration":3.921},{"text":"they are most roughly similar between","start":663.76,"duration":4.8},{"text":"the two teams but uh","start":666.56,"duration":3.36},{"text":"i don't think that there's a perfect","start":668.56,"duration":2.959},{"text":"science in terms of how you want to","start":669.92,"duration":2.64},{"text":"allocate it","start":671.519,"duration":3.281},{"text":"you kind of have to look at the stage of","start":672.56,"duration":3.279},{"text":"the","start":674.8,"duration":2.8},{"text":"project you are in and the maturity","start":675.839,"duration":3.601},{"text":"because sometimes each project","start":677.6,"duration":4.479},{"text":"uh each part of the stack will come to","start":679.44,"duration":3.12},{"text":"me","start":682.079,"duration":2.561},{"text":"will move at different paces you know","start":682.56,"duration":3.279},{"text":"depending upon","start":684.64,"duration":3.759},{"text":"what they're building so let's say","start":685.839,"duration":3.361},{"text":"you're doing","start":688.399,"duration":2.081},{"text":"something which is highly machine","start":689.2,"duration":3.759},{"text":"learning dependent so first you have to","start":690.48,"duration":3.68},{"text":"i'm talking about like when you're","start":692.959,"duration":2.721},{"text":"starting from scratch like in steady","start":694.16,"duration":2.16},{"text":"state like","start":695.68,"duration":2.08},{"text":"of course it's very different when","start":696.32,"duration":2.639},{"text":"you're starting from scratch like when","start":697.76,"duration":1.759},{"text":"you're","start":698.959,"duration":4.161},{"text":"beginning you first will may have to","start":699.519,"duration":5.041},{"text":"spend quite a bit of time like building","start":703.12,"duration":2.159},{"text":"your","start":704.56,"duration":2.399},{"text":"machine learning infrastructure data","start":705.279,"duration":3.361},{"text":"gathering all of that so those teams you","start":706.959,"duration":3.68},{"text":"probably want to like populate first","start":708.64,"duration":3.68},{"text":"uh before you start throwing models at","start":710.639,"duration":2.961},{"text":"it and maybe you can get away with like","start":712.32,"duration":2.639},{"text":"a relatively rudimentary","start":713.6,"duration":4.96},{"text":"team a smaller team like of just a few","start":714.959,"duration":7.041},{"text":"core experts in the perception part and","start":718.56,"duration":4.48},{"text":"then once that","start":722.0,"duration":3.44},{"text":"kind of is ready then you start putting","start":723.04,"duration":3.76},{"text":"more people on that area","start":725.44,"duration":3.519},{"text":"and uh maybe you don't have to like work","start":726.8,"duration":3.2},{"text":"so hard","start":728.959,"duration":2.961},{"text":"throw additional people on the","start":730.0,"duration":3.519},{"text":"infrastructure side of things","start":731.92,"duration":3.28},{"text":"and once it's only like once you start","start":733.519,"duration":3.841},{"text":"like unlocking the ability to see the","start":735.2,"duration":3.52},{"text":"world then you can start doing more and","start":737.36,"duration":3.599},{"text":"more complicated maneuvers and planning","start":738.72,"duration":3.84},{"text":"and then you start like pushing more","start":740.959,"duration":3.12},{"text":"into the planning world so","start":742.56,"duration":2.8},{"text":"and then you'll start hitting","start":744.079,"duration":2.721},{"text":"bottlenecks on that side and then you'll","start":745.36,"duration":2.56},{"text":"kind of say oh yeah","start":746.8,"duration":3.2},{"text":"i need to like add a few more people to","start":747.92,"duration":3.28},{"text":"unlock this thing","start":750.0,"duration":3.68},{"text":"in another area so you it kind of is","start":751.2,"duration":4.079},{"text":"very very dynamic so i wouldn't say like","start":753.68,"duration":2.32},{"text":"there's like a","start":755.279,"duration":3.841},{"text":"one standard formula through which uh we","start":756.0,"duration":4.8},{"text":"do resource allocation here","start":759.12,"duration":3.68},{"text":"i see but is it sort of like where","start":760.8,"duration":3.039},{"text":"you're seeing the most","start":762.8,"duration":2.8},{"text":"like actually interventions being caused","start":763.839,"duration":3.281},{"text":"by or is it like sort of","start":765.6,"duration":4.0},{"text":"where you see the most opportunity for","start":767.12,"duration":3.839},{"text":"improvement","start":769.6,"duration":3.44},{"text":"i think interventions uh in a steady","start":770.959,"duration":3.281},{"text":"state world uh","start":773.04,"duration":3.28},{"text":"uh like let's say there are a lot of","start":774.24,"duration":3.44},{"text":"bugs uh","start":776.32,"duration":2.88},{"text":"ignore interventions i mean if you just","start":777.68,"duration":3.76},{"text":"like replace interventions with bugs","start":779.2,"duration":3.92},{"text":"it's the same problem in any software","start":781.44,"duration":3.519},{"text":"like where do you have your biggest bugs","start":783.12,"duration":4.0},{"text":"right and sometimes uh throwing more","start":784.959,"duration":3.281},{"text":"people at the problem is the right","start":787.12,"duration":1.68},{"text":"answer","start":788.24,"duration":2.48},{"text":"and sometimes it is not the right answer","start":788.8,"duration":3.76},{"text":"in fact it's the wrong answer so you may","start":790.72,"duration":2.64},{"text":"want to like","start":792.56,"duration":2.64},{"text":"figure out putting the right people into","start":793.36,"duration":3.2},{"text":"the maybe you don't have the right","start":795.2,"duration":2.319},{"text":"expertise","start":796.56,"duration":2.719},{"text":"so it's not always clear that the","start":797.519,"duration":3.681},{"text":"resource allocation goes","start":799.279,"duration":3.921},{"text":"uh is directly proportional to the","start":801.2,"duration":3.92},{"text":"number of bugs that you have","start":803.2,"duration":4.96},{"text":"i see that makes sense like at this at","start":805.12,"duration":4.159},{"text":"this moment","start":808.16,"duration":2.64},{"text":"is there a particular part of the chain","start":809.279,"duration":2.881},{"text":"that feels like the most challenging for","start":810.8,"duration":2.4},{"text":"you that feels like","start":812.16,"duration":3.6},{"text":"there's the most room to improve i think","start":813.2,"duration":3.36},{"text":"that all","start":815.76,"duration":3.6},{"text":"like if you look at like the state of","start":816.56,"duration":4.56},{"text":"understanding and state of research in","start":819.36,"duration":2.4},{"text":"this","start":821.12,"duration":4.32},{"text":"space the place where","start":821.76,"duration":6.16},{"text":"there is a lot of scope for improvement","start":825.44,"duration":3.28},{"text":"is","start":827.92,"duration":3.2},{"text":"in the area of prediction and say","start":828.72,"duration":4.16},{"text":"behavior planning","start":831.12,"duration":3.6},{"text":"so there's an area where like there's","start":832.88,"duration":3.6},{"text":"still a lot of active development going","start":834.72,"duration":2.239},{"text":"on","start":836.48,"duration":2.32},{"text":"uh the industry is like changing past","start":836.959,"duration":3.281},{"text":"just recently i saw","start":838.8,"duration":3.44},{"text":"a really cool paper from uh waymo's","start":840.24,"duration":3.279},{"text":"research team","start":842.24,"duration":4.0},{"text":"um so there's like a lots of activity","start":843.519,"duration":4.32},{"text":"going on in that world","start":846.24,"duration":2.959},{"text":"so i would say that's the area which is","start":847.839,"duration":3.041},{"text":"developing quite a bit so this is like","start":849.199,"duration":2.961},{"text":"predicting where like another car is","start":850.88,"duration":2.959},{"text":"going to go where like a pedestal yeah","start":852.16,"duration":2.56},{"text":"another agent","start":853.839,"duration":2.641},{"text":"what will happen in the world uh in the","start":854.72,"duration":3.52},{"text":"next over the next few seconds","start":856.48,"duration":3.52},{"text":"who should i pay attention to what","start":858.24,"duration":3.44},{"text":"should i watch out for you know all the","start":860.0,"duration":3.04},{"text":"things that as a human we take it for","start":861.68,"duration":2.159},{"text":"granted","start":863.04,"duration":3.919},{"text":"right so those kind of problems so so","start":863.839,"duration":4.721},{"text":"like inside of the car","start":866.959,"duration":3.521},{"text":"that when it's when it's operating right","start":868.56,"duration":3.76},{"text":"now like how many different","start":870.48,"duration":5.68},{"text":"models are running approximately","start":872.32,"duration":5.6},{"text":"oh boy i don't i'm not sure i can tell","start":876.16,"duration":3.2},{"text":"you the actual number","start":877.92,"duration":4.96},{"text":"but uh in terms of ml like we have","start":879.36,"duration":6.32},{"text":"so many uh different ways of deploying","start":882.88,"duration":5.759},{"text":"these models right like so there's a","start":885.68,"duration":5.839},{"text":"the on the car you deploy them and then","start":888.639,"duration":4.161},{"text":"in the cloud like you have","start":891.519,"duration":2.88},{"text":"a couple of different ways of deploying","start":892.8,"duration":3.039},{"text":"them and if you look at lift at large","start":894.399,"duration":2.721},{"text":"like we have","start":895.839,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you can including right share this so","start":897.12,"duration":3.68},{"text":"many different ways like there are times","start":899.279,"duration":2.24},{"text":"when","start":900.8,"duration":2.719},{"text":"some teams at lyft like will just run","start":901.519,"duration":4.0},{"text":"that model on their desktop","start":903.519,"duration":5.12},{"text":"uh once in a while right pretty ad hoc","start":905.519,"duration":7.281},{"text":"there are online uh the the online loops","start":908.639,"duration":5.521},{"text":"that are running like you know active","start":912.8,"duration":2.479},{"text":"learning loops","start":914.16,"duration":3.84},{"text":"then there are like um online learning","start":915.279,"duration":4.0},{"text":"that is happening","start":918.0,"duration":4.56},{"text":"uh then there are they're all running in","start":919.279,"duration":4.24},{"text":"the cloud right","start":922.56,"duration":2.399},{"text":"then there are models that run on the","start":923.519,"duration":3.76},{"text":"phone","start":924.959,"duration":3.68},{"text":"then there are models that run in the","start":927.279,"duration":3.92},{"text":"car so we have models","start":928.639,"duration":3.841},{"text":"but i guess you're responsible for the","start":931.199,"duration":3.281},{"text":"ones that run in the car and the cloud","start":932.48,"duration":2.56},{"text":"for","start":934.48,"duration":2.799},{"text":"yeah we also helped the rideshare team","start":935.04,"duration":3.52},{"text":"as well so there's a","start":937.279,"duration":3.601},{"text":"few people on our team like who help","start":938.56,"duration":3.36},{"text":"because we have a lot of","start":940.88,"duration":2.8},{"text":"uh pretty amazing machine learning","start":941.92,"duration":3.279},{"text":"people so we also help","start":943.68,"duration":4.64},{"text":"the core part of it so i we do have","start":945.199,"duration":5.281},{"text":"visibility into like uh how they do it","start":948.32,"duration":3.92},{"text":"also so in fact sometimes","start":950.48,"duration":4.159},{"text":"our teams uh work on the cell phone","start":952.24,"duration":3.039},{"text":"models","start":954.639,"duration":2.32},{"text":"oh that's cool or

so","start":959.36,"duration":1.919},{"text":"many","start":960.8,"duration":2.24},{"text":"models at the same time i'm really","start":961.279,"duration":3.601},{"text":"curious about like your infrastructure","start":963.04,"duration":2.719},{"text":"for all this like","start":964.88,"duration":3.12},{"text":"how how often do these models update are","start":965.759,"duration":3.281},{"text":"they","start":968.0,"duration":3.44},{"text":"like it all depends it completely","start":969.04,"duration":5.44},{"text":"depends uh on","start":971.44,"duration":3.04},{"text":"which one you're talking about um so if","start":974.639,"duration":4.241},{"text":"you're doing the mapping ones","start":977.44,"duration":4.88},{"text":"um that's really dependent upon like uh","start":978.88,"duration":5.84},{"text":"the why you're using the model like so","start":982.32,"duration":4.16},{"text":"sometimes like these models are","start":984.72,"duration":5.28},{"text":"used to help the operators like uh","start":986.48,"duration":6.56},{"text":"if you know like as they work on the new","start":990.0,"duration":4.079},{"text":"techniques","start":993.04,"duration":2.799},{"text":"new ui techniques or whatever like where","start":994.079,"duration":2.961},{"text":"there's some additional assist they're","start":995.839,"duration":2.081},{"text":"providing","start":997.04,"duration":3.039},{"text":"they may update it when that time comes","start":997.92,"duration":4.32},{"text":"otherwise like generally they work","start":1000.079,"duration":4.32},{"text":"it's okay uh because they're assisting","start":1002.24,"duration":3.839},{"text":"humans as opposed to","start":1004.399,"duration":4.721},{"text":"uh doing it on their own so those models","start":1006.079,"duration":5.12},{"text":"don't update as uh frequently but the","start":1009.12,"duration":4.8},{"text":"models that are operating on the car uh","start":1011.199,"duration":3.681},{"text":"you","start":1013.92,"duration":4.719},{"text":"do that depending upon like the","start":1014.88,"duration":3.759},{"text":"depending upon like what you're","start":1018.959,"duration":3.281},{"text":"addressing and like which area that","start":1020.56,"duration":3.04},{"text":"you're trying to improve","start":1022.24,"duration":3.52},{"text":"so let's say like you know you're","start":1023.6,"duration":3.12},{"text":"working","start":1025.76,"duration":5.039},{"text":"in say winter and you see a lot of","start":1026.72,"duration":6.64},{"text":"vapor or smoke much more visible so","start":1030.799,"duration":4.481},{"text":"there'll be like some parts of the code","start":1033.36,"duration":3.839},{"text":"that are more impacted by all of that so","start":1035.28,"duration":4.24},{"text":"you'll see those iterating quite fast","start":1037.199,"duration":4.24},{"text":"uh in general though like uh these","start":1039.52,"duration":3.519},{"text":"models tend to get like","start":1041.439,"duration":4.48},{"text":"uh trained and iterated upon on almost a","start":1043.039,"duration":4.4},{"text":"continuous basis like the ones which go","start":1045.919,"duration":2.64},{"text":"on the car","start":1047.439,"duration":2.641},{"text":"and i guess like one thing that i","start":1048.559,"duration":4.0},{"text":"remember being kind of an issue","start":1050.08,"duration":3.92},{"text":"like did these models feed into each","start":1052.559,"duration":3.441},{"text":"other like i remember yeah when i was","start":1054.0,"duration":2.799},{"text":"building models","start":1056.0,"duration":2.16},{"text":"like there's a big versioning problem of","start":1056.799,"duration":4.0},{"text":"like one changes and the downstream ones","start":1058.16,"duration":4.96},{"text":"um need to update like do you actually","start":1060.799,"duration":4.481},{"text":"like then retrain everything downstream","start":1063.12,"duration":3.679},{"text":"from a model if you change like an","start":1065.28,"duration":3.6},{"text":"upstream model how do you","start":1066.799,"duration":5.041},{"text":"keep track of that so okay so the the","start":1068.88,"duration":4.48},{"text":"the models do feed into each other so","start":1071.84,"duration":1.92},{"text":"that","start":1073.36,"duration":2.64},{"text":"does happen so this is where i i would","start":1073.76,"duration":3.44},{"text":"say that since i'm not day-to-day","start":1076.0,"duration":2.96},{"text":"involved in this work like i don't know","start":1077.2,"duration":3.359},{"text":"the specific details about how the team","start":1078.96,"duration":3.52},{"text":"manages it but the way they","start":1080.559,"duration":4.0},{"text":"uh the way they do that is i don't think","start":1082.48,"duration":3.199},{"text":"that you have to go and retrain the","start":1084.559,"duration":2.721},{"text":"downstream models","start":1085.679,"duration":3.761},{"text":"the way we think about it is that you","start":1087.28,"duration":3.759},{"text":"will have your model metrics right so","start":1089.44,"duration":3.04},{"text":"you'll train your model you'll get like","start":1091.039,"duration":3.361},{"text":"a bunch of metrics around that model","start":1092.48,"duration":3.439},{"text":"but that's not enough like so you have","start":1094.4,"duration":3.44},{"text":"to kind of look at downstream metrics","start":1095.919,"duration":4.241},{"text":"also so because quite often those are","start":1097.84,"duration":3.92},{"text":"those tend to be the trickiest bugs also","start":1100.16,"duration":2.24},{"text":"like so","start":1101.76,"duration":2.4},{"text":"you'll kind of train your model and it","start":1102.4,"duration":3.6},{"text":"also looks good in terms of the metrics","start":1104.16,"duration":3.2},{"text":"and it's all working fine","start":1106.0,"duration":2.96},{"text":"you deploy it in the car and then you'll","start":1107.36,"duration":3.439},{"text":"see like the behavior change quite a bit","start":1108.96,"duration":3.28},{"text":"right you know i don't know like the car","start":1110.799,"duration":3.681},{"text":"may decide to break more often or it may","start":1112.24,"duration":4.799},{"text":"i don't know do something different and","start":1114.48,"duration":3.439},{"text":"then","start":1117.039,"duration":2.721},{"text":"you have to kind of debug that because","start":1117.919,"duration":3.521},{"text":"the model's behavior has impacted","start":1119.76,"duration":3.12},{"text":"something downstream so","start":1121.44,"duration":3.68},{"text":"then you have to kind of debug that uh","start":1122.88,"duration":3.919},{"text":"so uh you don't","start":1125.12,"duration":2.96},{"text":"it's not necessary that you have to","start":1126.799,"duration":3.201},{"text":"retrain those downstream models like you","start":1128.08,"duration":3.52},{"text":"may just like want to go and","start":1130.0,"duration":3.36},{"text":"figure out where the interaction is","start":1131.6,"duration":3.04},{"text":"happening","start":1133.36,"duration":2.72},{"text":"there are a few things you do have to be","start":1134.64,"duration":3.44},{"text":"very careful about uh the","start":1136.08,"duration":4.32},{"text":"you know like the validation set that","start":1138.08,"duration":4.4},{"text":"you use to validate this model","start":1140.4,"duration":4.159},{"text":"and that and the training set that you","start":1142.48,"duration":3.12},{"text":"use for the","start":1144.559,"duration":2.48},{"text":"the model downstream you have to be very","start":1145.6,"duration":3.12},{"text":"careful of keeping them all","start":1147.039,"duration":3.361},{"text":"separated and hopefully there's no","start":1148.72,"duration":3.199},{"text":"overlap otherwise like","start":1150.4,"duration":4.399},{"text":"you may introduce some weird artifacts","start":1151.919,"duration":3.201},{"text":"so","start":1154.799,"duration":1.441},{"text":"those things like the team has to be","start":1155.12,"duration":3.6},{"text":"very careful about is it do you think","start":1156.24,"duration":4.319},{"text":"it's harder with these kinds of","start":1158.72,"duration":3.36},{"text":"like this this modeling stuff a lot of","start":1160.559,"duration":3.12},{"text":"people have talked about that like","start":1162.08,"duration":3.52},{"text":"predicting timelines is is much more","start":1163.679,"duration":3.521},{"text":"difficult have you found that to be the","start":1165.6,"duration":2.88},{"text":"case or","start":1167.2,"duration":3.2},{"text":"the predicting timelines timelines of","start":1168.48,"duration":3.84},{"text":"like improvements like i feel like","start":1170.4,"duration":4.56},{"text":"software is already hard right yeah but","start":1172.32,"duration":4.16},{"text":"with it with the models it almost seems","start":1174.96,"duration":3.36},{"text":"like it might be unknowable to","start":1176.48,"duration":3.92},{"text":"to know like how like you know how we","start":1178.32,"duration":4.08},{"text":"get like x percent improvement like","start":1180.4,"duration":3.76},{"text":"do you give your team goals where where","start":1182.4,"duration":3.84},{"text":"you'll say like look i want to see like","start":1184.16,"duration":4.48},{"text":"you know a 10 improvement on this you","start":1186.24,"duration":3.2},{"text":"know","start":1188.64,"duration":4.159},{"text":"this accuracy metric or that's how they","start":1189.44,"duration":5.76},{"text":"they set themselves goals for improving","start":1192.799,"duration":3.12},{"text":"it","start":1195.2,"duration":2.479},{"text":"i think ultimately like it's the same","start":1195.919,"duration":3.281},{"text":"with any software like so","start":1197.679,"duration":3.921},{"text":"you set yourself a goal but it's just","start":1199.2,"duration":3.76},{"text":"because it's machine learning","start":1201.6,"duration":4.079},{"text":"doesn't mean that it's a new problem the","start":1202.96,"duration":3.04},{"text":"problem","start":1205.679,"duration":1.841},{"text":"has got to do with the fact that you","start":1206.0,"duration":3.12},{"text":"really don't know uh","start":1207.52,"duration":4.159},{"text":"the perfect solution and you can't like","start":1209.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"really estimate","start":1211.679,"duration":2.321},{"text":"uh what it will take for you to get to","start":1212.48,"duration":3.6},{"text":"that perfect solution so the way you do","start":1214.0,"duration":2.64},{"text":"that is","start":1216.08,"duration":2.959},{"text":"uh by series of experiments like by","start":1216.64,"duration":3.519},{"text":"iteration","start":1219.039,"duration":3.52},{"text":"um because if you know exactly what to","start":1220.159,"duration":3.681},{"text":"write then why will","start":1222.559,"duration":3.441},{"text":"you can it pretty accurately estimate","start":1223.84,"duration":3.199},{"text":"the time","start":1226.0,"duration":3.6},{"text":"and sometimes that's the case like in uh","start":1227.039,"duration":3.041},{"text":"say","start":1229.6,"duration":2.13},{"text":"like you know like oh yeah i need to","start":1230.08,"duration":3.12},{"text":"[Music]","start":1231.73,"duration":2.91},{"text":"i don't know refactor this code so you","start":1233.2,"duration":3.2},{"text":"know not roughly how long it will take","start":1234.64,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and you have test cases around you can","start":1236.4,"duration":3.2},{"text":"test it so you know like all your","start":1238.08,"duration":2.8},{"text":"unknown unknowns all of those things are","start":1239.6,"duration":2.16},{"text":"taken care of","start":1240.88,"duration":3.44},{"text":"yeah so if so you become more and more","start":1241.76,"duration":4.159},{"text":"predictable over time that's basically","start":1244.32,"duration":2.719},{"text":"what i'm trying to say","start":1245.919,"duration":3.76},{"text":"basically what happens is that as you","start":1247.039,"duration":3.441},{"text":"keep working","start":1249.679,"duration":4.0},{"text":"on the problem you start having a better","start":1250.48,"duration":4.559},{"text":"idea about","start":1253.679,"duration":4.48},{"text":"uh how long it will take because you","start":1255.039,"duration":3.441},{"text":"start","start":1258.159,"duration":2.561},{"text":"you started developing intuition about","start":1258.48,"duration":3.84},{"text":"that particular area","start":1260.72,"duration":5.439},{"text":"so like um then you'll you probably have","start":1262.32,"duration":5.92},{"text":"unit tests or like integration tests or","start":1266.159,"duration":3.041},{"text":"some other tests","start":1268.24,"duration":2.64},{"text":"that help you guide and focus on the","start":1269.2,"duration":4.16},{"text":"right areas and","start":1270.88,"duration":4.88},{"text":"carve out the noise so then you tend to","start":1273.36,"duration":3.76},{"text":"kind of get a lot more","start":1275.76,"duration":4.399},{"text":"uh predictable in","start":1277.12,"duration":5.28},{"text":"in the work that you do then after that","start":1280.159,"duration":4.161},{"text":"like if you change your model","start":1282.4,"duration":4.72},{"text":"you come in with the new model um you","start":1284.32,"duration":4.08},{"text":"know how many experiments you need to","start":1287.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"run like you know like how to scan i","start":1288.4,"duration":3.36},{"text":"mean then at the point it's like","start":1290.48,"duration":1.84},{"text":"throwing","start":1291.76,"duration":2.08},{"text":"money at the problem you know you","start":1292.32,"duration":3.2},{"text":"parallelize it and","start":1293.84,"duration":6.0},{"text":"you uh you do a lot more work","start":1295.52,"duration":6.32},{"text":"uh but you you are getting more and more","start":1299.84,"duration":3.76},{"text":"predictable over time just because like","start":1301.84,"duration":3.28},{"text":"you've built all this intuition and all","start":1303.6,"duration":3.12},{"text":"this collateral to test","start":1305.12,"duration":4.32},{"text":"so i would say that going back to your","start":1306.72,"duration":3.6},{"text":"question","start":1309.44,"duration":3.52},{"text":"uh are they predictable definitely not","start":1310.32,"duration":3.599},{"text":"at the outset","start":1312.96,"duration":2.56},{"text":"but as they start working on it they get","start":1313.919,"duration":3.681},{"text":"better and better more accurate about it","start":1315.52,"duration":4.24},{"text":"in terms of how much they can and this","start":1317.6,"duration":3.84},{"text":"is even like predicting improvements","start":1319.76,"duration":4.72},{"text":"like incremental improvements because","start":1321.44,"duration":4.96},{"text":"i would say more like let's say they're","start":1324.48,"duration":3.92},{"text":"trying to uh","start":1326.4,"duration":5.12},{"text":"fix issues um because","start":1328.4,"duration":5.04},{"text":"yeah so then they tend to get like more","start":1331.52,"duration":3.039},{"text":"and more predictable uh","start":1333.44,"duration":3.28},{"text":"predict predictable about that now if","start":1334.559,"duration":3.841},{"text":"they're bringing in if they say like oh","start":1336.72,"duration":2.959},{"text":"they set themselves the goal is saying","start":1338.4,"duration":2.48},{"text":"i'm going to improve it by","start":1339.679,"duration":4.721},{"text":"x percentage improvement","start":1340.88,"duration":5.36},{"text":"so the best way they can do that is by","start":1344.4,"duration":3.68},{"text":"running a whole bunch of experiments","start":1346.24,"duration":4.559},{"text":"and see like how fast they can come so","start":1348.08,"duration":3.839},{"text":"even that like","start":1350.799,"duration":2.721},{"text":"if your infrastructure is better and you","start":1351.919,"duration":3.281},{"text":"have good uh","start":1353.52,"duration":3.76},{"text":"set of tests and all that you can get","start":1355.2,"duration":3.52},{"text":"incrementally better but i don't think","start":1357.28,"duration":2.24},{"text":"that it's any","start":1358.72,"duration":2.079},{"text":"different than any other software","start":1359.52,"duration":2.639},{"text":"development that you can get super","start":1360.799,"duration":2.641},{"text":"predictable","start":1362.159,"duration":3.041},{"text":"well it's like one question or one thing","start":1363.44,"duration":3.44},{"text":"that some people say is different","start":1365.2,"duration":3.359},{"text":"or that i imagine it's different is that","start":1366.88,"duration":3.52},{"text":"like like when you think about like","start":1368.559,"duration":3.12},{"text":"testing these models","start":1370.4,"duration":4.08},{"text":"before you you put them into production","start":1371.679,"duration":4.401},{"text":"do you test them against like a set of","start":1374.48,"duration":4.0},{"text":"unit tests where it's like i i insist","start":1376.08,"duration":4.719},{"text":"that the model does this or that the car","start":1378.48,"duration":4.0},{"text":"does this in this situation or is it","start":1380.799,"duration":3.601},{"text":"more like an overall","start":1382.48,"duration":4.48},{"text":"um accuracy of like i wanted to kind of","start":1384.4,"duration":4.08},{"text":"you know make the right decision","start":1386.96,"duration":4.16},{"text":"you know 99 of the time like how do you","start":1388.48,"duration":4.8},{"text":"think about that","start":1391.12,"duration":3.52},{"text":"because aren't these models somewhat","start":1393.28,"duration":3.36},{"text":"inherently um","start":1394.64,"duration":4.64},{"text":"unpredictable or they're not always","start":1396.64,"duration":5.519},{"text":"going to do exactly the same thing right","start":1399.28,"duration":6.72},{"text":"right so what ha so you will you have to","start":1402.159,"duration":5.76},{"text":"okay so the way it works is that like","start":1406.0,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you have a model and you will have a","start":1407.919,"duration":2.64},{"text":"certain","start":1409.44,"duration":2.8},{"text":"uh i'm talking about perception models","start":1410.559,"duration":3.6},{"text":"because like different if you if you're","start":1412.24,"duration":2.88},{"text":"doing something else","start":1414.159,"duration":2.321},{"text":"downstream in some other area and","start":1415.12,"duration":3.28},{"text":"planning it's very different","start":1416.48,"duration":4.88},{"text":"um the you will have a certain metrics","start":1418.4,"duration":3.279},{"text":"uh","start":1421.36,"duration":3.36},{"text":"that you reached today okay","start":1421.679,"duration":6.161},{"text":"and then what you do is","start":1424.72,"duration":5.92},{"text":"um obviously you're working to go beyond","start":1427.84,"duration":4.0},{"text":"that metric","start":1430.64,"duration":4.8},{"text":"right so you try to you can identify","start":1431.84,"duration":5.28},{"text":"that as like as part of your model","start":1435.44,"duration":3.599},{"text":"development like you develop it you have","start":1437.12,"duration":3.439},{"text":"the model results","start":1439.039,"duration":3.841},{"text":"uh but that's not enough so you then","start":1440.559,"duration":3.12},{"text":"have to do","start":1442.88,"duration":3.679},{"text":"like some level of integration testing","start":1443.679,"duration":3.281},{"text":"uh","start":1446.559,"duration":2.48},{"text":"you put it all together and then you see","start":1446.96,"duration":3.92},{"text":"like hey how's the","start":1449.039,"duration":3.201},{"text":"downstream metric let's say if it's","start":1450.88,"duration":3.36},{"text":"perception so the","start":1452.24,"duration":3.6},{"text":"output of perception that like really","start":1454.24,"duration":3.28},{"text":"planning would consume is like","start":1455.84,"duration":4.719},{"text":"what we call tracks so these are","start":1457.52,"duration":5.6},{"text":"basically objects over time that you","start":1460.559,"duration":3.841},{"text":"track over time","start":1463.12,"duration":3.28},{"text":"so you have to get those tracking","start":1464.4,"duration":3.279},{"text":"metrics uh","start":1466.4,"duration":3.519},{"text":"improved or better or impacted in one","start":1467.679,"duration":3.6},{"text":"way or another","start":1469.919,"duration":4.481},{"text":"in those areas uh and then when you put","start":1471.279,"duration":4.321},{"text":"that in the car","start":1474.4,"duration":3.12},{"text":"then you know like the top level metrics","start":1475.6,"duration":3.6},{"text":"that you have you know like","start":1477.52,"duration":4.08},{"text":"has the uh how's the car behaving like","start":1479.2,"duration":4.0},{"text":"in whether it is","start":1481.6,"duration":5.52},{"text":"driving is it comfortable is it uh","start":1483.2,"duration":6.32},{"text":"is it safe so whatever metrics that you","start":1487.12,"duration":4.0},{"text":"track for any of those things","start":1489.52,"duration":3.68},{"text":"so you have to kind of get that right so","start":1491.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"you kind of have to like go through this","start":1493.2,"duration":3.2},{"text":"entire journey like so it's not like","start":1494.48,"duration":5.04},{"text":"one you just","start":1496.4,"duration":4.879},{"text":"tune the model once and then it works","start":1499.52,"duration":3.36},{"text":"and are you able to like run these tests","start":1501.279,"duration":2.721},{"text":"like every time","start":1502.88,"duration":2.48},{"text":"there's a new model or do you kind of","start":1504.0,"duration":3.76},{"text":"like try to pass the first test and then","start":1505.36,"duration":4.08},{"text":"sort of expand out","start":1507.76,"duration":3.12},{"text":"yeah yeah you have to run through the","start":1509.44,"duration":3.52},{"text":"entire gamut uh if you do something","start":1510.88,"duration":4.0},{"text":"brand new have you seen do you have any","start":1512.96,"duration":2.64},{"text":"interesting","start":1514.88,"duration":3.039},{"text":"like examples of something that sort of","start":1515.6,"duration":3.199},{"text":"improved the","start":1517.919,"duration":3.601},{"text":"the local test but made the the more","start":1518.799,"duration":3.841},{"text":"yeah yeah","start":1521.52,"duration":3.6},{"text":"there's a bunch of examples the thing is","start":1522.64,"duration":6.399},{"text":"i don't know what i can tell you though","start":1525.12,"duration":6.559},{"text":"yeah yeah i mean there are there are all","start":1529.039,"duration":3.921},{"text":"these cases like where","start":1531.679,"duration":4.0},{"text":"you'll see the interaction between uh","start":1532.96,"duration":3.28},{"text":"the","start":1535.679,"duration":3.281},{"text":"model say the upstream model would say","start":1536.24,"duration":4.08},{"text":"in the perception","start":1538.96,"duration":4.64},{"text":"and what happens on the planning side um","start":1540.32,"duration":5.04},{"text":"i mean i can tell you as a friend but","start":1543.6,"duration":3.36},{"text":"maybe i should put it up there on","start":1545.36,"duration":4.96},{"text":"on the okay you know like","start":1546.96,"duration":5.199},{"text":"i was just giving you the example of uh","start":1550.32,"duration":5.2},{"text":"that uh one where we had uh","start":1552.159,"duration":4.721},{"text":"i was telling about you know like in","start":1555.52,"duration":3.84},{"text":"winter like you have a lot more smoke","start":1556.88,"duration":5.679},{"text":"that you have to deal with so you we","start":1559.36,"duration":4.16},{"text":"could see that like the model","start":1562.559,"duration":2.24},{"text":"performance was pretty good but like","start":1563.52,"duration":2.72},{"text":"when we integrated it it didn't work","start":1564.799,"duration":2.24},{"text":"right","start":1566.24,"duration":2.559},{"text":"and so then we had we had to go back and","start":1567.039,"duration":3.201},{"text":"see there was some","start":1568.799,"duration":4.401},{"text":"interaction going on between like the uh","start":1570.24,"duration":4.319},{"text":"the upstream model in the downstream","start":1573.2,"duration":2.88},{"text":"model that caused this problem","start":1574.559,"duration":2.881},{"text":"so we have about these these kind of","start":1576.08,"duration":3.52},{"text":"things happen all the time","start":1577.44,"duration":4.719},{"text":"so the team over time has become much","start":1579.6,"duration":4.0},{"text":"more rigorous about all these things so","start":1582.159,"duration":3.12},{"text":"the anytime that they do this there's a","start":1583.6,"duration":3.199},{"text":"lot of automation built in","start":1585.279,"duration":3.331},{"text":"they test all of these things and","start":1586.799,"duration":3.521},{"text":"[Music]","start":1588.61,"duration":4.83},{"text":"uh they uh yeah so they have to go","start":1590.32,"duration":4.08},{"text":"through the whole thing","start":1593.44,"duration":4.719},{"text":"i see it's like when you see","start":1594.4,"duration":7.279},{"text":"teams improve models is it is it","start":1598.159,"duration":5.601},{"text":"typically that they've like","start":1601.679,"duration":4.321},{"text":"collected more different data or kind of","start":1603.76,"duration":3.68},{"text":"changed the data pipeline","start":1606.0,"duration":4.24},{"text":"or like improved the the model itself","start":1607.44,"duration":4.479},{"text":"like do you have a sense of like what's","start":1610.24,"duration":2.559},{"text":"or","start":1611.919,"duration":3.041},{"text":"i guess a lot of times most often you'll","start":1612.799,"duration":3.601},{"text":"see like the improvements happen with","start":1614.96,"duration":3.36},{"text":"the right data","start":1616.4,"duration":3.84},{"text":"and you see the right model architecture","start":1618.32,"duration":4.0},{"text":"yeah it's less often that the","start":1620.24,"duration":3.439},{"text":"model architecture itself has to be","start":1622.32,"duration":4.08},{"text":"changed got it yeah","start":1623.679,"duration":4.48},{"text":"but is it is it like an mlt itself","start":1626.4,"duration":3.44},{"text":"that's like asking for different","start":1628.159,"duration":3.201},{"text":"types of data sets like do they kind of","start":1629.84,"duration":3.92},{"text":"control that process or is there","start":1631.36,"duration":5.12},{"text":"like a data team no no we don't okay so","start":1633.76,"duration":3.84},{"text":"this is another big","start":1636.48,"duration":4.4},{"text":"uh thing that we've been um i would say","start":1637.6,"duration":4.559},{"text":"somewhat religious about it","start":1640.88,"duration":3.44},{"text":"level five we don't have a notion of","start":1642.159,"duration":3.921},{"text":"like engineering team and a science team","start":1644.32,"duration":3.04},{"text":"or a data team","start":1646.08,"duration":5.52},{"text":"um we just have a perception team so","start":1647.36,"duration":7.36},{"text":"i think like i i'll tell you my mental","start":1651.6,"duration":4.24},{"text":"model around like an","start":1654.72,"duration":4.24},{"text":"ml i think ml is a skill um","start":1655.84,"duration":5.28},{"text":"so it's like anything you know you know","start":1658.96,"duration":3.52},{"text":"how to write python create","start":1661.12,"duration":2.96},{"text":"or you know how to write c plus plus","start":1662.48,"duration":3.919},{"text":"that's a skill so ml is a skill","start":1664.08,"duration":4.88},{"text":"but a skill alone is not enough like so","start":1666.399,"duration":4.321},{"text":"you need domain expertise","start":1668.96,"duration":3.839},{"text":"so just because you know how to write","start":1670.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"python","start":1672.799,"duration":3.521},{"text":"may be good enough for some things but","start":1674.0,"duration":3.84},{"text":"if you are trying to build i don't know","start":1676.32,"duration":2.479},{"text":"some complex","start":1677.84,"duration":2.559},{"text":"insurance thing like you probably need","start":1678.799,"duration":3.36},{"text":"to understand insurance","start":1680.399,"duration":5.121},{"text":"so um how do you divide the","start":1682.159,"duration":6.4},{"text":"domain knowledge from the skill in some","start":1685.52,"duration":4.399},{"text":"cases you can like and","start":1688.559,"duration":2.561},{"text":"you see that happening like so you'll","start":1689.919,"duration":2.961},{"text":"have pms write a spec and then they'll","start":1691.12,"duration":3.12},{"text":"give you something and say like","start":1692.88,"duration":4.399},{"text":"go implement it right but more","start":1694.24,"duration":4.4},{"text":"more often you'll see that like the","start":1697.279,"duration":3.041},{"text":"engineer has to like really ramp up and","start":1698.64,"duration":3.68},{"text":"truly understand like what the","start":1700.32,"duration":3.359},{"text":"actual problem is because if they have","start":1702.32,"duration":2.959},{"text":"to debug something and they have to kind","start":1703.679,"duration":2.801},{"text":"of really understand","start":1705.279,"duration":2.88},{"text":"what is going on it's the same thing in","start":1706.48,"duration":3.12},{"text":"ml so if","start":1708.159,"duration":3.281},{"text":"so we've tried to kind of have we have a","start":1709.6,"duration":3.679},{"text":"team that is called a prediction team so","start":1711.44,"duration":3.359},{"text":"their job is to predict","start":1713.279,"duration":4.081},{"text":"so they uh so we don't have a difference","start":1714.799,"duration":3.521},{"text":"between like","start":1717.36,"duration":3.039},{"text":"some data scientist or a data team and","start":1718.32,"duration":3.28},{"text":"like an engineer","start":1720.399,"duration":3.681},{"text":"so it's the same people who have the","start":1721.6,"duration":3.679},{"text":"domain expertise","start":1724.08,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and have ml skills and that's kind of","start":1725.279,"duration":4.721},{"text":"how we've been operating so far","start":1727.52,"duration":3.92},{"text":"oh that's cool so so all of your teams","start":1730.0,"duration":3.279},{"text":"sort of have a mix of","start":1731.44,"duration":5.119},{"text":"skills yeah so we","start":1733.279,"duration":6.4},{"text":"i've seen this like uh this seems to be","start":1736.559,"duration":4.881},{"text":"a pretty big debate in the industry like","start":1739.679,"duration":2.321},{"text":"you know","start":1741.44,"duration":2.32},{"text":"there will be this oh should we have a","start":1742.0,"duration":3.919},{"text":"science and an engineering team","start":1743.76,"duration":4.96},{"text":"idea so the mental model i come up with","start":1745.919,"duration":3.76},{"text":"is like","start":1748.72,"duration":3.6},{"text":"job of a science is to develop knowledge","start":1749.679,"duration":4.641},{"text":"what they produce","start":1752.32,"duration":4.56},{"text":"their production is knowledge and uh the","start":1754.32,"duration":4.16},{"text":"job of an engineering team is an","start":1756.88,"duration":2.56},{"text":"artifact","start":1758.48,"duration":4.48},{"text":"in most cases uh we are actually","start":1759.44,"duration":4.8},{"text":"building an artifact we are building a","start":1762.96,"duration":3.36},{"text":"product so in which case i kind of","start":1764.24,"duration":3.679},{"text":"see that science versus engineering","start":1766.32,"duration":3.12},{"text":"divide to be less germane","start":1767.919,"duration":3.441},{"text":"in these areas you can have a research","start":1769.44,"duration":4.16},{"text":"team their job is to produce knowledge","start":1771.36,"duration":4.24},{"text":"and that's okay but when it comes to","start":1773.6,"duration":3.92},{"text":"like developing a product","start":1775.6,"duration":3.84},{"text":"i've always found that it is better to","start":1777.52,"duration":3.039},{"text":"have","start":1779.44,"duration":2.64},{"text":"the domain knowledge and the skilled","start":1780.559,"duration":3.12},{"text":"people together and ideally if","start":1782.08,"duration":2.959},{"text":"you can find the unicorns which are both","start":1783.679,"duration":3.201},{"text":"that's awesome so but you'll have very","start":1785.039,"duration":3.201},{"text":"few of those but then you kind of have","start":1786.88,"duration":2.64},{"text":"to like uh","start":1788.24,"duration":2.96},{"text":"bracket them with people with the right","start":1789.52,"duration":3.2},{"text":"skills","start":1791.2,"duration":3.359},{"text":"does that make sense no totally yeah i","start":1792.72,"duration":3.92},{"text":"mean i i we see the same","start":1794.559,"duration":3.521},{"text":"thing with a lot of the companies we","start":1796.64,"duration":3.279},{"text":"work with and i do","start":1798.08,"duration":4.4},{"text":"i think if i was if i was in charge i","start":1799.919,"duration":3.681},{"text":"think i would uh","start":1802.48,"duration":3.04},{"text":"lean the same way as you of you know","start":1803.6,"duration":3.12},{"text":"make sure that","start":1805.52,"duration":3.44},{"text":"um yeah make sure that people doing ml","start":1806.72,"duration":3.92},{"text":"are right inside the teams that","start":1808.96,"duration":2.64},{"text":"are actually trying to accomplish","start":1810.64,"duration":2.32},{"text":"something right and now coming back to","start":1811.6,"duration":2.799},{"text":"the data question that you asked","start":1812.96,"duration":4.319},{"text":"yeah so um if you are if you are a","start":1814.399,"duration":4.241},{"text":"domain specialist","start":1817.279,"duration":3.12},{"text":"right you already have a very good","start":1818.64,"duration":3.36},{"text":"intuition about what is the right data","start":1820.399,"duration":3.681},{"text":"that you want","start":1822.0,"duration":4.799},{"text":"so uh and like we just said like most of","start":1824.08,"duration":4.319},{"text":"the problems seem to be about","start":1826.799,"duration":4.081},{"text":"finding the right data than the right","start":1828.399,"duration":3.041},{"text":"model","start":1830.88,"duration":3.919},{"text":"so so you have this like nice property","start":1831.44,"duration":5.119},{"text":"where the team just knows like what what","start":1834.799,"duration":3.681},{"text":"is the right data to seek","start":1836.559,"duration":4.081},{"text":"got it that makes sense is it","start":1838.48,"duration":3.76},{"text":"challenging for you","start":1840.64,"duration":3.279},{"text":"to deploy models into production like","start":1842.24,"duration":4.24},{"text":"i've never had to deploy into","start":1843.919,"duration":3.921},{"text":"hardware like is that is that a","start":1846.48,"duration":2.72},{"text":"challenging step for you like do you","start":1847.84,"duration":2.319},{"text":"find sometimes","start":1849.2,"duration":2.56},{"text":"the model doesn't perform the same way","start":1850.159,"duration":3.52},{"text":"you expected when it's actually","start":1851.76,"duration":4.56},{"text":"inside the hardware or i think the","start":1853.679,"duration":3.681},{"text":"biggest difference","start":1856.32,"duration":4.56},{"text":"between uh what is say like when you're","start":1857.36,"duration":5.12},{"text":"building it for like a cloud service","start":1860.88,"duration":2.48},{"text":"versus what","start":1862.48,"duration":4.24},{"text":"we are doing here is is that the","start":1863.36,"duration":7.12},{"text":"model may they may be like a a transform","start":1866.72,"duration":6.559},{"text":"after training right generally and the","start":1870.48,"duration":4.16},{"text":"transform after training","start":1873.279,"duration":3.601},{"text":"you could say quantization or something","start":1874.64,"duration":4.08},{"text":"like that right so you have to have","start":1876.88,"duration":3.919},{"text":"develop a good understanding about that","start":1878.72,"duration":5.199},{"text":"uh about the impact of that on the model","start":1880.799,"duration":4.72},{"text":"the other thing that becomes really","start":1883.919,"duration":3.281},{"text":"important like when you're deploying it","start":1885.519,"duration":3.681},{"text":"and this is no different for mobile apps","start":1887.2,"duration":3.12},{"text":"also","start":1889.2,"duration":3.12},{"text":"where you deploy uh models on your","start":1890.32,"duration":3.12},{"text":"mobile phone","start":1892.32,"duration":2.4},{"text":"is that like you have to be really","start":1893.44,"duration":4.64},{"text":"careful about uh power and latency","start":1894.72,"duration":4.88},{"text":"so you have to like really be rigorous","start":1898.08,"duration":3.76},{"text":"about your op count how much time does","start":1899.6,"duration":2.72},{"text":"it take","start":1901.84,"duration":3.76},{"text":"so all of that you have to think about","start":1902.32,"duration":4.8},{"text":"have you built infrastructure to","start":1905.6,"duration":3.439},{"text":"actually monitor these models as they","start":1907.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"run in production","start":1909.039,"duration":4.161},{"text":"yeah yeah so actually we try we have an","start":1910.48,"duration":4.16},{"text":"internal framework","start":1913.2,"duration":4.0},{"text":"uh that in fact i was just watching","start":1914.64,"duration":4.32},{"text":"their video just before this","start":1917.2,"duration":3.52},{"text":"um they were doing a demo because that","start":1918.96,"duration":3.04},{"text":"just built a new one","start":1920.72,"duration":2.64},{"text":"and that takes care of all of these for","start":1922.0,"duration":3.039},{"text":"you like so it will kind of like do the","start":1923.36,"duration":4.64},{"text":"stats and everything like uh","start":1925.039,"duration":5.681},{"text":"when you are building and training your","start":1928.0,"duration":3.2},{"text":"model","start":1930.72,"duration":2.559},{"text":"and running your experiments and in fact","start":1931.2,"duration":4.16},{"text":"we dump all of that probably in","start":1933.279,"duration":4.321},{"text":"uh","start":1935.36,"duration":2.24},{"text":"do you um do you look for uh some people","start":1938.399,"duration":4.4},{"text":"talk to us about like worrying about","start":1941.519,"duration":2.481},{"text":"feature drift like","start":1942.799,"duration":2.961},{"text":"would you notice of like a sensor broke","start":1944.0,"duration":3.279},{"text":"or something like if the model's getting","start":1945.76,"duration":2.48},{"text":"a different","start":1947.279,"duration":2.321},{"text":"kind of data is that something you look","start":1948.24,"duration":4.08},{"text":"for is it mainly just like latency","start":1949.6,"duration":4.64},{"text":"of the model oh i see so you're talking","start":1952.32,"duration":3.839},{"text":"about like uh the model","start":1954.24,"duration":4.159},{"text":"some strange behavior yeah if it's like","start":1956.159,"duration":3.52},{"text":"a weird situation","start":1958.399,"duration":3.841},{"text":"where it's it seems to be struggling","start":1959.679,"duration":3.441},{"text":"yeah so","start":1962.24,"duration":2.319},{"text":"there could be so many problems right","start":1963.12,"duration":3.679},{"text":"like so it could be","start":1964.559,"duration":5.761},{"text":"yeah so it could be some sensor has","start":1966.799,"duration":6.121},{"text":"gone bad um","start":1970.32,"duration":4.0},{"text":"[Music]","start":1972.92,"duration":2.759},{"text":"i'll just think about something specific","start":1974.32,"duration":4.16},{"text":"here um","start":1975.679,"duration":4.24},{"text":"yeah those things happen but like the","start":1978.48,"duration":3.199},{"text":"way we find out a bunch of these things","start":1979.919,"duration":3.12},{"text":"is that increasingly like we","start":1981.679,"duration":3.12},{"text":"depend on something we call unsupervised","start":1983.039,"duration":3.281},{"text":"metrics so","start":1984.799,"duration":4.081},{"text":"you know like imagine like what's the","start":1986.32,"duration":5.52},{"text":"rough size of a bicycle","start":1988.88,"duration":2.96},{"text":"yeah i don't know what like a meter or","start":1991.919,"duration":3.281},{"text":"two two meters","start":1994.08,"duration":2.88},{"text":"oh no no it's gonna be i mean width","start":1995.2,"duration":3.12},{"text":"probably but like like","start":1996.96,"duration":2.8},{"text":"probably a lot more than that than a","start":1998.32,"duration":3.839},{"text":"meter oh yeah right maybe at three or","start":1999.76,"duration":3.039},{"text":"four","start":2002.159,"duration":4.0},{"text":"right so uh but if you see like a","start":2002.799,"duration":5.921},{"text":"50 meter bicycle then you probably","start":2006.159,"duration":3.76},{"text":"there's probably something wrong with it","start":2008.72,"duration":2.64},{"text":"right right i'm just giving that as

imagine","start":2011.84,"duration":3.199},{"text":"that","start":2014.48,"duration":2.4},{"text":"there's a lot of such heuristics that","start":2015.039,"duration":4.321},{"text":"you could put together","start":2016.88,"duration":6.08},{"text":"and track and uh if you start seeing","start":2019.36,"duration":5.36},{"text":"like weird things happening out of that","start":2022.96,"duration":3.439},{"text":"that enables you to catch like lots of","start":2024.72,"duration":3.839},{"text":"crazy bugs and sometimes that's a really","start":2026.399,"duration":3.76},{"text":"good way of catching long tail issues as","start":2028.559,"duration":2.561},{"text":"well because","start":2030.159,"duration":2.801},{"text":"you may not it may not result in a","start":2031.12,"duration":3.36},{"text":"disengagement right","start":2032.96,"duration":4.8},{"text":"but you may see some weird behavior","start":2034.48,"duration":4.96},{"text":"or it may trigger a disengagement but it","start":2037.76,"duration":3.36},{"text":"is probably not often enough that like","start":2039.44,"duration":2.0},{"text":"you","start":2041.12,"duration":2.88},{"text":"know that that's a problem uh important","start":2041.44,"duration":4.16},{"text":"problem to focus on","start":2044.0,"duration":4.159},{"text":"so so we increasingly we depend on all","start":2045.6,"duration":4.799},{"text":"these like unsupervised metrics where","start":2048.159,"duration":4.881},{"text":"the data comes in then you compute all","start":2050.399,"duration":3.041},{"text":"these","start":2053.04,"duration":3.44},{"text":"various interesting statistics","start":2053.44,"duration":5.679},{"text":"and then you figure out what is actually","start":2056.48,"duration":4.0},{"text":"going on and then you go back and debug","start":2059.119,"duration":2.0},{"text":"it","start":2060.48,"duration":2.48},{"text":"so that's so interesting that's funny i","start":2061.119,"duration":3.601},{"text":"was just looking at jared tickets you","start":2062.96,"duration":3.199},{"text":"know for my company","start":2064.72,"duration":4.72},{"text":"and uh i was like when you if you see","start":2066.159,"duration":4.801},{"text":"like one thing wrong","start":2069.44,"duration":3.12},{"text":"does that like warrant your ticket like","start":2070.96,"duration":3.679},{"text":"if you see one bicycle","start":2072.56,"duration":3.839},{"text":"that's like that's too big will you","start":2074.639,"duration":3.44},{"text":"actually like file a ticket against that","start":2076.399,"duration":2.641},{"text":"or how do you","start":2078.079,"duration":2.881},{"text":"yeah you should you should i mean all of","start":2079.04,"duration":3.28},{"text":"these things should be like","start":2080.96,"duration":3.76},{"text":"filed in a ticket and if it is that","start":2082.32,"duration":4.799},{"text":"glaringly obvious","start":2084.72,"duration":4.32},{"text":"then yeah and you have the time to do it","start":2087.119,"duration":3.52},{"text":"uh to take a look at it","start":2089.04,"duration":4.0},{"text":"you will so that's only one example","start":2090.639,"duration":3.361},{"text":"where this thing is wrong","start":2093.04,"duration":2.559},{"text":"we're gonna take it so yeah and again","start":2094.0,"duration":2.56},{"text":"this has got nothing to do with","start":2095.599,"duration":2.321},{"text":"self-driving cars i mean we used to have","start":2096.56,"duration":2.64},{"text":"similar problems in windows","start":2097.92,"duration":2.88},{"text":"you know like there'll be some weird","start":2099.2,"duration":3.6},{"text":"one-off thing that you saw","start":2100.8,"duration":5.12},{"text":"and uh we would record it and then next","start":2102.8,"duration":4.319},{"text":"thing you know like if it's","start":2105.92,"duration":4.159},{"text":"uh uh some code changes that suddenly","start":2107.119,"duration":3.441},{"text":"things","start":2110.079,"duration":1.921},{"text":"tends to pop up and then you're like oh","start":2110.56,"duration":2.88},{"text":"yeah i've seen it in these environments","start":2112.0,"duration":2.64},{"text":"and these situations and then you kind","start":2113.44,"duration":3.52},{"text":"of went","start":2114.64,"duration":2.32},{"text":"anytime you see something anonymous you","start":2117.839,"duration":3.121},{"text":"just file it","start":2119.839,"duration":4.481},{"text":"and uh hopefully like you know um","start":2120.96,"duration":4.96},{"text":"you have more context that you capture","start":2124.32,"duration":3.68},{"text":"and then it will help you debug","start":2125.92,"duration":3.36},{"text":"do you have a team that's tasked with","start":2128.0,"duration":2.72},{"text":"looking for that or is that like kind of","start":2129.28,"duration":3.6},{"text":"everybody's looking for those things","start":2130.72,"duration":5.28},{"text":"uh so we have we have a team that","start":2132.88,"duration":5.92},{"text":"uh like obviously a lot of our reports","start":2136.0,"duration":4.0},{"text":"come from","start":2138.8,"duration":4.64},{"text":"the drivers driving the road but then um","start":2140.0,"duration":6.96},{"text":"we also have to uh have additional","start":2143.44,"duration":4.0},{"text":"people","start":2146.96,"duration":3.28},{"text":"to go back and like look at the data and","start":2147.44,"duration":4.0},{"text":"uh","start":2150.24,"duration":3.76},{"text":"see if there's something weird going on","start":2151.44,"duration":3.76},{"text":"they're not necessarily engineers we","start":2154.0,"duration":1.92},{"text":"call them opera","start":2155.2,"duration":3.28},{"text":"operations so they kind of scan and like","start":2155.92,"duration":4.4},{"text":"take a look at these things","start":2158.48,"duration":3.92},{"text":"and of course like engineers also like","start":2160.32,"duration":3.519},{"text":"you know run into","start":2162.4,"duration":4.64},{"text":"these you know interesting cases","start":2163.839,"duration":4.961},{"text":"and they may actually look at it as well","start":2167.04,"duration":4.079},{"text":"but there's so much data coming in","start":2168.8,"duration":5.92},{"text":"um that uh which one do you look at like","start":2171.119,"duration":5.121},{"text":"and how do you prioritize that really","start":2174.72,"duration":3.2},{"text":"becomes a more interesting problem","start":2176.24,"duration":3.52},{"text":"yeah it sounds incredibly challenging","start":2177.92,"duration":3.439},{"text":"yeah yeah yeah i mean","start":2179.76,"duration":4.079},{"text":"by the way this is a problem of like any","start":2181.359,"duration":5.201},{"text":"software that has scale right","start":2183.839,"duration":5.52},{"text":"so in our case uh like i mean i've had","start":2186.56,"duration":4.64},{"text":"again like the","start":2189.359,"duration":5.521},{"text":"luck to work on uh major products that","start":2191.2,"duration":4.8},{"text":"operated at scale","start":2194.88,"duration":2.959},{"text":"and it's the same problem like whether","start":2196.0,"duration":3.119},{"text":"you're running like new speed at","start":2197.839,"duration":2.961},{"text":"facebook or you know like you're running","start":2199.119,"duration":2.401},{"text":"like","start":2200.8,"duration":2.72},{"text":"uh some issues in windows or like you're","start":2201.52,"duration":3.04},{"text":"running","start":2203.52,"duration":4.319},{"text":"a car on the road for thousands of miles","start":2204.56,"duration":5.76},{"text":"yeah uh so then you'll get like lots and","start":2207.839,"duration":3.601},{"text":"lots of reports","start":2210.32,"duration":3.6},{"text":"and that's the issue of diversity yeah i","start":2211.44,"duration":3.36},{"text":"guess these are just","start":2213.92,"duration":3.76},{"text":"a sort of complexity at scale yeah it's","start":2214.8,"duration":4.319},{"text":"a complexity and scale problem right","start":2217.68,"duration":2.0},{"text":"like so","start":2219.119,"duration":2.321},{"text":"it's an extremely simple problem you","start":2219.68,"duration":3.6},{"text":"know you have a sanitized test track and","start":2221.44,"duration":3.36},{"text":"you're running your car in that","start":2223.28,"duration":4.88},{"text":"and yeah it's like probably you can","start":2224.8,"duration":5.68},{"text":"be very selective about what you do and","start":2228.16,"duration":3.679},{"text":"be very rigorous","start":2230.48,"duration":2.72},{"text":"but when you're running it on the road","start":2231.839,"duration":3.441},{"text":"anything can happen right and it's kind","start":2233.2,"duration":3.28},{"text":"of like you know","start":2235.28,"duration":4.72},{"text":"you run like","start":2236.48,"duration":5.52},{"text":"your operating system on any kind of pc","start":2240.0,"duration":3.359},{"text":"anybody built and","start":2242.0,"duration":2.4},{"text":"you still have to figure out what's","start":2243.359,"duration":5.121},{"text":"happening and so you've um","start":2244.4,"duration":5.6},{"text":"you've i guess you've been you've been","start":2248.48,"duration":3.28},{"text":"at lyft for three years almost now","start":2250.0,"duration":4.4},{"text":"yeah and and the organization must have","start":2251.76,"duration":4.72},{"text":"grown quite a bit in that time i'm kind","start":2254.4,"duration":3.12},{"text":"of curious about","start":2256.48,"duration":3.359},{"text":"how processes have just changed as the","start":2257.52,"duration":3.52},{"text":"organization's grown and things have","start":2259.839,"duration":3.441},{"text":"solidified","start":2261.04,"duration":4.31},{"text":"a lot right like so um","start":2263.28,"duration":4.24},{"text":"[Music]","start":2265.35,"duration":5.29},{"text":"it's it's kind of interesting um","start":2267.52,"duration":5.839},{"text":"there are teams which are uh were","start":2270.64,"duration":5.199},{"text":"non-existent and then they've kind of","start":2273.359,"duration":4.161},{"text":"been built and then now they were there","start":2275.839,"duration":3.041},{"text":"at scale like i mean","start":2277.52,"duration":2.72},{"text":"i would say the current perception team","start":2278.88,"duration":2.56},{"text":"is one of those like which is now","start":2280.24,"duration":2.32},{"text":"operating at scale","start":2281.44,"duration":2.639},{"text":"but then there are still some new teams","start":2282.56,"duration":3.92},{"text":"that are forming uh and","start":2284.079,"duration":4.161},{"text":"and it almost feels like they're doing","start":2286.48,"duration":3.76},{"text":"things which were","start":2288.24,"duration":3.68},{"text":"say a perception team or some other team","start":2290.24,"duration":4.16},{"text":"was doing it at their beginning","start":2291.92,"duration":4.32},{"text":"so but of course they have a lot more","start":2294.4,"duration":3.199},{"text":"guidance now because there are other","start":2296.24,"duration":2.16},{"text":"teams that have","start":2297.599,"duration":2.881},{"text":"path broken for them and they get","start":2298.4,"duration":3.12},{"text":"through it","start":2300.48,"duration":3.52},{"text":"um a few things happen one is like as","start":2301.52,"duration":3.68},{"text":"you kind of get like","start":2304.0,"duration":4.72},{"text":"a more um bigger scale","start":2305.2,"duration":4.96},{"text":"as the organization is grown in the","start":2308.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"beginning we would not","start":2310.16,"duration":4.56},{"text":"care about like uh where the training","start":2312.0,"duration":3.68},{"text":"was happening","start":2314.72,"duration":2.72},{"text":"you know like the engineer would train","start":2315.68,"duration":3.52},{"text":"it on their desktop uh","start":2317.44,"duration":4.0},{"text":"the workstation that they had uh it","start":2319.2,"duration":3.44},{"text":"would be like that you know like as the","start":2321.44,"duration":3.6},{"text":"team started growing and","start":2322.64,"duration":4.479},{"text":"more engineers started coming in and","start":2325.04,"duration":3.84},{"text":"reproducibility and all of that starts","start":2327.119,"duration":3.361},{"text":"becoming a real problem because multiple","start":2328.88,"duration":3.76},{"text":"people are working on the same thing","start":2330.48,"duration":3.92},{"text":"so then you start becoming much more","start":2332.64,"duration":3.68},{"text":"rigorous in your process","start":2334.4,"duration":3.92},{"text":"and uh that's fine that'll work only","start":2336.32,"duration":3.039},{"text":"like if you have","start":2338.32,"duration":3.519},{"text":"maybe like a four of them working","start":2339.359,"duration":3.281},{"text":"together","start":2341.839,"duration":2.641},{"text":"but then once you grow beyond that grow","start":2342.64,"duration":3.68},{"text":"beyond that like uh","start":2344.48,"duration":4.24},{"text":"process won't fix it or like mutual","start":2346.32,"duration":4.08},{"text":"agreements won't fix it so you probably","start":2348.72,"duration":2.96},{"text":"should be building a","start":2350.4,"duration":3.679},{"text":"framework to help you standardize that","start":2351.68,"duration":3.2},{"text":"process and like","start":2354.079,"duration":3.121},{"text":"just make you not worry about all the","start":2354.88,"duration":3.6},{"text":"moving parts","start":2357.2,"duration":4.56},{"text":"so that's why and then after that you'll","start":2358.48,"duration":4.48},{"text":"find that like the framework doesn't","start":2361.76,"duration":2.079},{"text":"last you","start":2362.96,"duration":2.24},{"text":"and then you'll write a new framework","start":2363.839,"duration":2.961},{"text":"for the new scale of problems that you","start":2365.2,"duration":2.56},{"text":"run into","start":2366.8,"duration":3.12},{"text":"and we've gone through all of that then","start":2367.76,"duration":3.52},{"text":"another thing that will happen is like","start":2369.92,"duration":3.6},{"text":"as you kind of ramp up and you grow that","start":2371.28,"duration":3.36},{"text":"much","start":2373.52,"duration":2.8},{"text":"you'll start becoming cognizant of your","start":2374.64,"duration":3.36},{"text":"cost right because","start":2376.32,"duration":3.2},{"text":"uh especially if you're doing it on the","start":2378.0,"duration":4.079},{"text":"cloud they provide a lot of sharp","start":2379.52,"duration":5.92},{"text":"uh sharp knives and as you kind of","start":2382.079,"duration":5.201},{"text":"play with them you can cut yourself and","start":2385.44,"duration":3.36},{"text":"lead yourself to that","start":2387.28,"duration":4.64},{"text":"uh in terms of money and uh so again","start":2388.8,"duration":4.4},{"text":"like uh you have to","start":2391.92,"duration":2.88},{"text":"you start becoming very very careful","start":2393.2,"duration":3.919},{"text":"about and you kind of try to","start":2394.8,"duration":5.6},{"text":"build your uh ml frameworks or whatever","start":2397.119,"duration":4.72},{"text":"maybe it's not just ml but even","start":2400.4,"duration":2.719},{"text":"simulation","start":2401.839,"duration":2.961},{"text":"you start building your frameworks to","start":2403.119,"duration":3.601},{"text":"help keep that in check","start":2404.8,"duration":3.279},{"text":"then you start becoming very very","start":2406.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"rigorous about your data partitioning","start":2408.079,"duration":4.081},{"text":"and you have to have versioning and you","start":2410.0,"duration":4.24},{"text":"track all of them in like a","start":2412.16,"duration":4.32},{"text":"in a tool and you probably want a custom","start":2414.24,"duration":3.839},{"text":"tool which is kind of why how we ended","start":2416.48,"duration":2.16},{"text":"up like","start":2418.079,"duration":2.401},{"text":"you know building our own analytics tool","start":2418.64,"duration":3.52},{"text":"internally to track a number of these","start":2420.48,"duration":2.32},{"text":"things","start":2422.16,"duration":2.0},{"text":"and then you start getting even more","start":2422.8,"duration":2.88},{"text":"like to track all your experiment data","start":2424.16,"duration":2.88},{"text":"and then you you've built in weights and","start":2425.68,"duration":2.48},{"text":"biases","start":2427.04,"duration":3.2},{"text":"uh then you start like running into time","start":2428.16,"duration":3.52},{"text":"problems you know you do more and more","start":2430.24,"duration":2.24},{"text":"complicated","start":2431.68,"duration":2.96},{"text":"models and then you want to get done","start":2432.48,"duration":3.44},{"text":"with your experiments faster","start":2434.64,"duration":2.24},{"text":"and then you start getting into","start":2435.92,"duration":2.8},{"text":"distributed training and you know we've","start":2436.88,"duration":3.68},{"text":"gone through this entire journey","start":2438.72,"duration":4.639},{"text":"i'm sure there's more","start":2440.56,"duration":2.799},{"text":"yeah what's next i'm sure there's more","start":2444.079,"duration":5.28},{"text":"i'm sure if i talk to somebody at google","start":2447.68,"duration":2.159},{"text":"they will","start":2449.359,"duration":1.841},{"text":"they're probably gone like even further","start":2449.839,"duration":3.681},{"text":"than a lot of the things we've done","start":2451.2,"duration":4.24},{"text":"well thanks that was well said um we","start":2453.52,"duration":3.28},{"text":"always close with two questions i'm kind","start":2455.44,"duration":2.96},{"text":"of curious how you're gonna answer these","start":2456.8,"duration":3.92},{"text":"um so one is like um it's machine","start":2458.4,"duration":3.679},{"text":"learning specific but maybe you could","start":2460.72,"duration":3.44},{"text":"expand it to autonomous vehicles","start":2462.079,"duration":4.721},{"text":"i guess what's one underrated aspect of","start":2464.16,"duration":4.56},{"text":"machine learning or avs that","start":2466.8,"duration":2.96},{"text":"you think people should pay more","start":2468.72,"duration":3.2},{"text":"attention to than they do","start":2469.76,"duration":3.839},{"text":"i've noticed that there's a tendency to","start":2471.92,"duration":3.76},{"text":"think of it as just as a skill and it's","start":2473.599,"duration":3.361},{"text":"like uh","start":2475.68,"duration":4.24},{"text":"you throw data at it and then the you","start":2476.96,"duration":4.879},{"text":"train and it gets better","start":2479.92,"duration":4.96},{"text":"and you can do that over and over again","start":2481.839,"duration":4.401},{"text":"and then you may be able to get a good","start":2484.88,"duration":2.0},{"text":"result","start":2486.24,"duration":2.32},{"text":"but i always go back to the idea that","start":2486.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"like one very underrated aspect of","start":2488.56,"duration":3.68},{"text":"machine learning is that like it has to","start":2490.72,"duration":3.28},{"text":"be coupled with domain knowledge","start":2492.24,"duration":3.76},{"text":"you really have to like unders have a","start":2494.0,"duration":3.599},{"text":"good understanding about like what","start":2496.0,"duration":3.359},{"text":"problem you're solving and have a good","start":2497.599,"duration":3.361},{"text":"understanding of the domain in fact i","start":2499.359,"duration":2.401},{"text":"would say","start":2500.96,"duration":2.56},{"text":"spend quite a bit of time like really","start":2501.76,"duration":3.2},{"text":"understanding the data that you're going","start":2503.52,"duration":2.319},{"text":"to get","start":2504.96,"duration":3.2},{"text":"and then because i said right the right","start":2505.839,"duration":4.24},{"text":"data is more important than like a lot","start":2508.16,"duration":2.88},{"text":"of data","start":2510.079,"duration":2.881},{"text":"uh you actually there was this","start":2511.04,"duration":4.24},{"text":"interesting case for us like where we","start":2512.96,"duration":5.359},{"text":"made some change and i we cut down our","start":2515.28,"duration":5.12},{"text":"data usage by half","start":2518.319,"duration":3.841},{"text":"it became way cheaper for us to even","start":2520.4,"duration":5.6},{"text":"like end the model become more accurate","start":2522.16,"duration":7.28},{"text":"so um so that's what you get by like","start":2526.0,"duration":5.2},{"text":"actually genuinely understanding and

know i a few years ago","start":157.84,"duration":5.2},{"text":"basically uh during my phd i","start":160.48,"duration":5.119},{"text":"you know uh did a internship at google","start":163.04,"duration":3.52},{"text":"where you know i use","start":165.599,"duration":3.92},{"text":"their mini computers to train uh some","start":166.56,"duration":3.44},{"text":"deep

back","start":177.12,"duration":3.52},{"text":"uh to stanford and then i found all","start":179.04,"duration":3.279},{"text":"sudden i no longer had access to all","start":180.64,"duration":2.8},{"text":"that code","start":182.319,"duration":2.721},{"text":"i couldn't really reproduce my results","start":183.44,"duration":3.28},{"text":"so i think the starting point was i just","start":185.04,"duration":2.479},{"text":"wanted to","start":186.72,"duration":4.08},{"text":"reproduce the results of my own paper","start":187.519,"duration":5.281},{"text":"and i think to start basically it was","start":190.8,"duration":5.04},{"text":"just a few scripts in","start":192.8,"duration":6.159},{"text":"diano and karis at that point and i put","start":195.84,"duration":4.88},{"text":"it up on github is why not","start":198.959,"duration":4.721},{"text":"then a few more people started to use it","start":200.72,"duration":4.48},{"text":"and it's just kind of grown slowly and","start":203.68,"duration":3.52},{"text":"subtly from there","start":205.2,"duration":5.2},{"text":"i think the original kind of aim of","start":207.2,"duration":5.84},{"text":"deep cam was really to enable uh kind of","start":210.4,"duration":4.16},{"text":"answering questions about you know","start":213.04,"duration":3.199},{"text":"so-called small molecules","start":214.56,"duration":4.959},{"text":"so most of the drugs that we take","start":216.239,"duration":6.321},{"text":"um your tylenols your ibuprofens things","start":219.519,"duration":4.0},{"text":"like that are all","start":222.56,"duration":4.239},{"text":"small molecules but over time i think","start":223.519,"duration":4.961},{"text":"pharma has actually begun to shift a bit","start":226.799,"duration":2.881},{"text":"so now there's like","start":228.48,"duration":3.039},{"text":"neural classes of medicines there's of","start":229.68,"duration":3.68},{"text":"course things like vaccines","start":231.519,"duration":3.601},{"text":"so nowadays i think deep chem is slowly","start":233.36,"duration":4.0},{"text":"trying to grow out to","start":235.12,"duration":4.399},{"text":"you know enable open source medicine","start":237.36,"duration":4.079},{"text":"discovery across a broader swath","start":239.519,"duration":6.881},{"text":"of uh broader swath of modern biotech","start":241.439,"duration":6.0},{"text":"so that's just kind of a little bit","start":246.4,"duration":2.399},{"text":"about the project i think there is a","start":247.439,"duration":3.041},{"text":"fairly active community of","start":248.799,"duration":4.241},{"text":"uh users there's a number of educational","start":250.48,"duration":4.16},{"text":"materials and tutorials","start":253.04,"duration":5.199},{"text":"built up around it um i i think it's","start":254.64,"duration":4.719},{"text":"also that","start":258.239,"duration":2.56},{"text":"you know a lot of medicine is quite","start":259.359,"duration":4.001},{"text":"proprietary like uh medicine discovery","start":260.799,"duration":4.641},{"text":"you know there's biotech's if you often","start":263.36,"duration":3.52},{"text":"like see their","start":265.44,"duration":2.72},{"text":"advertising maternity like in our","start":266.88,"duration":3.039},{"text":"proprietary algorithm our proprietary","start":268.16,"duration":2.56},{"text":"technique","start":269.919,"duration":3.521},{"text":"um which you know has worked fine for","start":270.72,"duration":4.16},{"text":"the industry for a long time you know","start":273.44,"duration":2.4},{"text":"that's the way most","start":274.88,"duration":3.28},{"text":"medicine we know was discovered but of","start":275.84,"duration":3.68},{"text":"course as we know in tech you know","start":278.16,"duration":1.759},{"text":"there's","start":279.52,"duration":2.56},{"text":"been a shift in that open

companies we discover things","start":284.8,"duration":4.32},{"text":"so i think part of the goal of dpm is to","start":286.8,"duration":4.64},{"text":"bring some of this open source energy","start":289.12,"duration":5.12},{"text":"to the biotech drug discovery community","start":291.44,"duration":4.16},{"text":"enable more people","start":294.24,"duration":3.679},{"text":"to be able to share uh sharing these","start":295.6,"duration":3.84},{"text":"tools","start":297.919,"duration":2.881},{"text":"and it seems like you've definitely been","start":299.44,"duration":3.039},{"text":"successful at that i mean i","start":300.8,"duration":4.8},{"text":"you know even before i knew of you i um","start":302.479,"duration":5.681},{"text":"you know talking to folks at genentech","start":305.6,"duration":3.68},{"text":"and","start":308.16,"duration":3.92},{"text":"gsk and like i would say like over half","start":309.28,"duration":4.24},{"text":"of the conversations i've had with","start":312.08,"duration":3.119},{"text":"pharma companies have mentioned","start":313.52,"duration":3.28},{"text":"um deep chem and i thought it was pretty","start":315.199,"duration":3.921},{"text":"cool that they're all using the same","start":316.8,"duration":4.959},{"text":"um platform and you know contributing ip","start":319.12,"duration":4.32},{"text":"just","start":321.759,"duration":3.361},{"text":"i didn't know that pharma did that at","start":323.44,"duration":3.599},{"text":"all so that seems really um","start":325.12,"duration":4.799},{"text":"wonderful i think it definitely is kind","start":327.039,"duration":3.841},{"text":"of a new","start":329.919,"duration":2.56},{"text":"shift in thinking but of course you know","start":330.88,"duration":3.28},{"text":"pharma's seen the fact you know","start":332.479,"duration":3.521},{"text":"tensorflow's open source high torches","start":334.16,"duration":2.879},{"text":"open source","start":336.0,"duration":2.639},{"text":"so i think it is the beginnings of a","start":337.039,"duration":3.361},{"text":"shift um","start":338.639,"duration":3.441},{"text":"at the same time i think like ip","start":340.4,"duration":3.519},{"text":"considerations definitely do","start":342.08,"duration":4.959},{"text":"matter a lot so i think a lot of uh you","start":343.919,"duration":4.481},{"text":"know folks","start":347.039,"duration":2.961},{"text":"find they can't contribute at some","start":348.4,"duration":3.12},{"text":"workplaces which is fine i think it's","start":350.0,"duration":3.039},{"text":"kind of just a policy","start":351.52,"duration":3.679},{"text":"but there is still a culture of caution","start":353.039,"duration":4.641},{"text":"around potentially releasing valuable ip","start":355.199,"duration":2.961},{"text":"but","start":357.68,"duration":2.239},{"text":"i think what what helps things a bit is","start":358.16,"duration":3.44},{"text":"there's this recognition that","start":359.919,"duration":3.521},{"text":"you know oftentimes it's you know the","start":361.6,"duration":3.92},{"text":"actual data that's the core","start":363.44,"duration":3.84},{"text":"ip it's not necessarily the algorithm","start":365.52,"duration":4.0},{"text":"that's just kind of calculus","start":367.28,"duration":4.96},{"text":"and so i think there is uh some","start":369.52,"duration":4.16},{"text":"favorable shifts in the industry but","start":372.24,"duration":2.799},{"text":"it's definitely something that's","start":373.68,"duration":3.76},{"text":"only beginning to happen so just taking","start":375.039,"duration":4.481},{"text":"a step back because i think not everyone","start":377.44,"duration":4.16},{"text":"necessarily knows the field at all and","start":379.52,"duration":3.44},{"text":"actually didn't you know until","start":381.6,"duration":2.879},{"text":"maybe six months ago when we started to","start":382.96,"duration":3.12},{"text":"see our users doing this","start":384.479,"duration":3.681},{"text":"um what's sort of the canonical problem","start":386.08,"duration":5.76},{"text":"here that that pharma is trying to solve","start":388.16,"duration":6.8},{"text":"yeah i think it's a great question um","start":391.84,"duration":5.919},{"text":"so i think you know at heart the

the","start":485.199,"duration":3.44},{"text":"hardest problems here is that","start":487.199,"duration":3.84},{"text":"there's this question of toxicity so","start":488.639,"duration":3.441},{"text":"there's all sorts of","start":491.039,"duration":3.121},{"text":"you know i think the silly example for","start":492.08,"duration":3.2},{"text":"this is

a","start":559.2,"duration":4.24},{"text":"fact let's make sure on a big","start":561.12,"duration":4.64},{"text":"trial with lots of people um and","start":563.44,"duration":3.68},{"text":"occasionally there's things like phase","start":565.76,"duration":3.12},{"text":"four which is after the drug is

even","start":598.8,"duration":3.52},{"text":"obvious to me necessarily","start":600.24,"duration":4.0},{"text":"what the machine learning problem is","start":602.32,"duration":3.04},{"text":"within that","start":604.24,"duration":2.88},{"text":"i mean what's like what's the input data","start":605.36,"duration":3.36},{"text":"and what's the like what are we

great","start":610.56,"duration":3.12},{"text":"question","start":613.2,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and usually the challenge here is that","start":613.68,"duration":3.92},{"text":"you start with","start":616.64,"duration":3.04},{"text":"a very narrow sliver of these problems","start":617.6,"duration":4.0},{"text":"so there are say limited models

hard","start":647.279,"duration":2.0},{"text":"to","start":648.8,"duration":3.76},{"text":"gauge that and then how is it possible","start":649.279,"duration":5.521},{"text":"sorry dumb questions i'll just ask the","start":652.56,"duration":3.279},{"text":"questions i actually have","start":654.8,"duration":4.32},{"text":"so uh like how would you possibly have","start":655.839,"duration":5.12},{"text":"enough training data like you're not","start":659.12,"duration":2.399},{"text":"going to","start":660.959,"duration":3.281},{"text":"keep poisoning cats

that","start":702.24,"duration":2.96},{"text":"well okay i know something about the","start":703.839,"duration":3.12},{"text":"molecule i know something about

it","start":744.0,"duration":3.839},{"text":"sounds like you have","start":746.48,"duration":2.96},{"text":"like a molecule and you want to predict","start":747.839,"duration":3.841},{"text":"some

dumb","start":785.6,"duration":3.359},{"text":"questions before you so","start":786.959,"duration":4.161},{"text":"how do you even represent a molecule","start":788.959,"duration":3.761},{"text":"like text that seems kind of obvious to","start":791.12,"duration":3.279},{"text":"me but like how do you","start":792.72,"duration":3.119},{"text":"um i mean it seems like molecules are","start":794.399,"duration":2.641},{"text":"variable length and they have some","start":795.839,"duration":2.321},{"text":"structure","start":797.04,"duration":4.239},{"text":"is it like is it a

that there's kind of the","start":804.399,"duration":3.281},{"text":"field of chemo informatics where a","start":806.079,"duration":2.88},{"text":"number of years ago they defined a","start":807.68,"duration":2.959},{"text":"language called smiles","start":808.959,"duration":5.601},{"text":"um you know smi les so smile strings are","start":810.639,"duration":5.841},{"text":"basically language that allow you to","start":814.56,"duration":4.32},{"text":"write down molecules it's most often","start":816.48,"duration":3.68},{"text":"used for small molecules","start":818.88,"duration":2.8},{"text":"but you can write pretty big

many","start":825.68,"duration":2.8},{"text":"architectures take the smiles and do","start":826.88,"duration":3.759},{"text":"convert it into a graph","start":828.48,"duration":3.84},{"text":"and the idea is that the atoms in the","start":830.639,"duration":4.32},{"text":"molecule turn into nodes into graph and","start":832.32,"duration":5.44},{"text":"bonds usually turn to edges also","start":834.959,"duration":3.921},{"text":"sometimes you do something like a","start":837.76,"duration":2.48},{"text":"distance cut off because there's these","start":838.88,"duration":2.88},{"text":"non-covalent interactions so you might","start":840.24,"duration":2.24},{"text":"say","start":841.76,"duration":3.04},{"text":"all atoms that are yay

helium","start":871.76,"duration":3.759},{"text":"or like there's there's probably a few","start":873.6,"duration":3.12},{"text":"like slightly

there was a paper","start":1066.08,"duration":3.52},{"text":"from google recently where they showed","start":1067.679,"duration":2.561},{"text":"that","start":1069.6,"duration":4.079},{"text":"on one

like","start":1076.64,"duration":3.919},{"text":"a few percent you know hit rate you know","start":1078.24,"duration":3.76},{"text":"that that is like things that actually","start":1080.559,"duration":2.961},{"text":"like looked like they might","start":1082.0,"duration":3.28},{"text":"work in that stage and when they you","start":1083.52,"duration":3.12},{"text":"know bootstrapped it by training and","start":1085.28,"duration":2.399},{"text":"machine learning model","start":1086.64,"duration":2.399},{"text":"then

i","start":1090.96,"duration":3.04},{"text":"think that's like","start":1092.72,"duration":3.52},{"text":"one step out of like 20 in the process","start":1094.0,"duration":3.12},{"text":"so","start":1096.24,"duration":2.319},{"text":"so you take the thing that comes from","start":1097.12,"duration":3.12},{"text":"that then you go to the next stage where","start":1098.559,"duration":3.281},{"text":"you're like well okay this molecule is","start":1100.24,"duration":3.12},{"text":"good but it turns out that","start":1101.84,"duration":3.68},{"text":"you know it gets caught up by the liver","start":1103.36,"duration":3.84},{"text":"we need to like change it somehow so","start":1105.52,"duration":2.88},{"text":"that it avoids that","start":1107.2,"duration":3.04},{"text":"and right now the best way to do that is","start":1108.4,"duration":3.36},{"text":"still to hire a seasoned team of","start":1110.24,"duration":2.799},{"text":"medicinal chemists","start":1111.76,"duration":5.039},{"text":"who can guide you through that

small","start":1118.559,"duration":2.24},{"text":"amounts of data","start":1119.76,"duration":3.44},{"text":"so like the google paper they it was at","start":1120.799,"duration":4.24},{"text":"an

something","start":1127.84,"duration":3.199},{"text":"but in the later stages you might have","start":1129.44,"duration":3.599},{"text":"like 100 and then all of a sudden

kind of witchcraft","start":1135.36,"duration":5.36},{"text":"so that's where that's i think part of","start":1138.64,"duration":3.12},{"text":"the reason because like maybe you","start":1140.72,"duration":3.04},{"text":"started out with something that was","start":1141.76,"duration":4.799},{"text":"you know uh ai generated but then ten","start":1143.76,"duration":4.4},{"text":"medicinal chemists came along tweaked it","start":1146.559,"duration":2.881},{"text":"here tweaked it there then what do you","start":1148.16,"duration":2.0},{"text":"have at the end","start":1149.44,"duration":3.2},{"text":"uh and honestly we don't know like i","start":1150.16,"duration":3.84},{"text":"think 10 years from now","start":1152.64,"duration":2.8},{"text":"maybe there will be a molecule we can","start":1154.0,"duration":3.039},{"text":"point to but for now i think it's so","start":1155.44,"duration":2.64},{"text":"fussy","start":1157.039,"duration":2.88},{"text":"it's kind of interesting that you said","start":1158.08,"duration":3.839},{"text":"um i mean i totally resonate with the","start":1159.919,"duration":2.721},{"text":"imagenet","start":1161.919,"duration":2.481},{"text":"moment because i i definitely remember","start":1162.64,"duration":3.44},{"text":"the imagenet moment for vision because i","start":1164.4,"duration":2.159},{"text":"was","start":1166.08,"duration":1.68},{"text":"you know running

image","start":1173.12,"duration":3.28},{"text":"applications were working","start":1174.88,"duration":2.799},{"text":"but i guess what was kind of interesting","start":1176.4,"duration":3.84},{"text":"was that i actually feel like the","start":1177.679,"duration":4.321},{"text":"imagenet moment","start":1180.24,"duration":5.2},{"text":"came a few years after imagenet like it","start":1182.0,"duration":5.76},{"text":"like not only did it have to you know we","start":1185.44,"duration":4.16},{"text":"saw vision starting to work but it took","start":1187.76,"duration":3.36},{"text":"people a while to realize it and then","start":1189.6,"duration":3.6},{"text":"companies started to staff up and now","start":1191.12,"duration":4.559},{"text":"you know i can i can go on pinterest and","start":1193.2,"duration":3.839},{"text":"you know click on stuff and buy them","start":1195.679,"duration":2.321},{"text":"right away or i can","start":1197.039,"duration":2.88},{"text":"you know like find all my baby photos","start":1198.0,"duration":3.52},{"text":"and my

it","start":1213.12,"duration":3.52},{"text":"seems like this could be set up for a","start":1215.2,"duration":2.32},{"text":"real","start":1216.64,"duration":4.0},{"text":"serious disappointment also you know i","start":1217.52,"duration":3.44},{"text":"think","start":1220.64,"duration":3.519},{"text":"um i think it's very kind of insightful","start":1220.96,"duration":4.48},{"text":"as an

that","start":1349.6,"duration":7.36},{"text":"um i i think there is a hope","start":1353.76,"duration":6.32},{"text":"that it might lead to a breakthrough

think i'm so hopeful i","start":1391.84,"duration":4.719},{"text":"think there is real potential in value","start":1394.08,"duration":5.68},{"text":"but i think also like um once you've","start":1396.559,"duration":3.841},{"text":"gone oh","start":1399.76,"duration":1.84},{"text":"spent some time in it i think that you","start":1400.4,"duration":3.44},{"text":"get some

was","start":1406.32,"duration":3.28},{"text":"coming into the space","start":1408.32,"duration":3.52},{"text":"um but yeah i think it's just the hype","start":1409.6,"duration":4.24},{"text":"train

uh","start":1418.48,"duration":4.48},{"text":"coming up a few years from now","start":1421.12,"duration":3.28},{"text":"interesting people seem

an","start":1426.08,"duration":4.32},{"text":"interesting perspective","start":1429.039,"duration":3.12},{"text":"yeah maybe maybe we're still coming down","start":1430.4,"duration":3.12},{"text":"and

a","start":1465.76,"duration":3.68},{"text":"useful collection of data and benchmarks","start":1467.6,"duration":3.36},{"text":"we put together but","start":1469.44,"duration":4.88},{"text":"the

but","start":1750.08,"duration":3.04},{"text":"it","start":1752.399,"duration":2.801},{"text":"um it just it seems so daunting the idea","start":1753.12,"duration":3.2},{"text":"that you have to","start":1755.2,"duration":4.719},{"text":"like order um molecules somehow and","start":1756.32,"duration":6.079},{"text":"then like run a wet lab or something i","start":1759.919,"duration":3.841},{"text":"mean just","start":1762.399,"duration":4.801},{"text":"um i guess okay i have a whole bunch of","start":1763.76,"duration":4.48},{"text":"different questions i hope you don't","start":1767.2,"duration":1.839},{"text":"mind","start":1768.24,"duration":2.88},{"text":"one thought i have i guess it's probably","start":1769.039,"duration":3.52},{"text":"like the dumb things that people","start":1771.12,"duration":2.72},{"text":"think of when they first hear about this","start":1772.559,"duration":3.36},{"text":"stuff but it's sort of it seems like if","start":1773.84,"duration":3.36},{"text":"you could model things

that","start":1782.72,"duration":2.72},{"text":"might be","start":1784.88,"duration":3.76},{"text":"simpler is that is that true i i think","start":1785.44,"duration":3.92},{"text":"absolutely","start":1788.64,"duration":2.399},{"text":"um now unfortunately i think the","start":1789.36,"duration":2.88},{"text":"challenging part is some of the most","start":1791.039,"duration":2.64},{"text":"interesting applications are in places","start":1792.24,"duration":2.4},{"text":"like batteries","start":1793.679,"duration":5.441},{"text":"and of course batteries uh so i i think","start":1794.64,"duration":6.32},{"text":"there's there are kind of other fields","start":1799.12,"duration":3.279},{"text":"like for example it turns out you know","start":1800.96,"duration":2.56},{"text":"the uh","start":1802.399,"duration":2.88},{"text":"motor crop

techniques","start":1807.279,"duration":3.041},{"text":"so it it actually yeah it's just","start":1810.64,"duration":3.279},{"text":"properties of","start":1812.64,"duration":3.919},{"text":"of molecules and in fact i this is kind","start":1813.919,"duration":4.081},{"text":"of coming back to that you know","start":1816.559,"duration":3.521},{"text":"thin line between poison and medicine","start":1818.0,"duration":3.279},{"text":"you know a pesticide","start":1820.08,"duration":2.4},{"text":"if you actually take a look at some","start":1821.279,"duration":3.041},{"text":"pesticides and you look at them","start":1822.48,"duration":3.199},{"text":"they kind of look like the same small","start":1824.32,"duration":3.04},{"text":"molecules you have in medicine","start":1825.679,"duration":3.12},{"text":"um which might explain a few things","start":1827.36,"duration":3.439},{"text":"about the world just just saying there","start":1828.799,"duration":4.88},{"text":"uh i think there's also other","start":1830.799,"duration":4.88},{"text":"applications like i","start":1833.679,"duration":4.24},{"text":"i think in industrial applications","start":1835.679,"duration":4.081},{"text":"broadly in petrochemicals","start":1837.919,"duration":5.201},{"text":"even i think there's a bit um it's","start":1839.76,"duration":5.12},{"text":"so there's absolutely kind of other","start":1843.12,"duration":3.279},{"text":"cases but you know i think","start":1844.88,"duration":2.88},{"text":"you know we in the software industry are","start":1846.399,"duration":3.28},{"text":"sometimes used to work in our world of","start":1847.76,"duration":4.72},{"text":"bits and you know","start":1849.679,"duration":2.801},{"text":"whereas i think like when you get into","start":1852.559,"duration":3.201},{"text":"these industries you're like","start":1854.0,"duration":3.279},{"text":"at the end you have to make something","start":1855.76,"duration":3.44},{"text":"and i think there is that slowdown i","start":1857.279,"duration":2.561},{"text":"think","start":1859.2,"duration":3.04},{"text":"um maybe battery's actually the hardest","start":1859.84,"duration":4.319},{"text":"pharma is a little behind that i think","start":1862.24,"duration":2.72},{"text":"some of these","start":1864.159,"duration":3.201},{"text":"agricultural applications are a little","start":1864.96,"duration":3.76},{"text":"easier to get to market but still quite","start":1867.36,"duration":2.24},{"text":"daunting","start":1868.72,"duration":3.36},{"text":"um and i i think in general it just kind","start":1869.6,"duration":4.0},{"text":"of comes down to like","start":1872.08,"duration":2.88},{"text":"for a lot of these things like it's","start":1873.6,"duration":2.559},{"text":"actually really easy to make something","start":1874.96,"duration":1.92},{"text":"poisonous","start":1876.159,"duration":4.0},{"text":"and as

that","start":1882.24,"duration":3.36},{"text":"all of a sudden like uh you invent a","start":1883.44,"duration":3.76},{"text":"miracle something or other","start":1885.6,"duration":3.6},{"text":"of

there's","start":1896.72,"duration":3.76},{"text":"microplastics everywhere","start":1898.96,"duration":2.959},{"text":"and you know i think this is a type

kind of comes down to the","start":1919.12,"duration":3.12},{"text":"fact that i think","start":1921.039,"duration":2.48},{"text":"you know living systems are","start":1922.24,"duration":2.96},{"text":"extraordinarily complicated and making","start":1923.519,"duration":2.561},{"text":"something","start":1925.2,"duration":3.68},{"text":"that is tested

think","start":1936.32,"duration":1.92},{"text":"you wrote a book on this right so like","start":1936.88,"duration":3.36},{"text":"what are the other categories of things","start":1938.24,"duration":2.559},{"text":"and i guess","start":1940.24,"duration":3.6},{"text":"i'd be curious your take on like how how","start":1940.799,"duration":5.201},{"text":"promising they are since i","start":1943.84,"duration":3.52},{"text":"it sounds like it's hard to separate the","start":1946.0,"duration":2.64},{"text":"hype but you probably thought deeply","start":1947.36,"duration":2.559},{"text":"about this","start":1948.64,"duration":3.039},{"text":"i i definitely think there's a whole","start":1949.919,"duration":3.841},{"text":"host of

might do with microscopy","start":1972.48,"duration":5.199},{"text":"so it's actually so one of the kind of","start":1974.559,"duration":4.881},{"text":"interesting things about this field

that","start":1985.36,"duration":4.72},{"text":"um oftentimes like so there's some say","start":1986.48,"duration":5.199},{"text":"readouts of a cell that

a","start":2103.599,"duration":5.281},{"text":"petri dish uh and essentially they test","start":2105.76,"duration":4.64},{"text":"you put a little bit of medicine

a","start":2121.92,"duration":1.76},{"text":"different","start":2123.2,"duration":3.6},{"text":"shape is that um that's a really good","start":2123.68,"duration":3.919},{"text":"question i think","start":2126.8,"duration":4.799},{"text":"it it often depends on","start":2127.599,"duration":5.841},{"text":"so i think it depends on the disease in","start":2131.599,"duration":3.76},{"text":"question so like a common thing","start":2133.44,"duration":5.04},{"text":"say for like cancer is that you know","start":2135.359,"duration":5.361},{"text":"the silly one is can you kill the tumor","start":2138.48,"duration":3.28},{"text":"uh cells","start":2140.72,"duration":4.08},{"text":"which um the

so","start":2145.839,"duration":3.601},{"text":"that's something that's a medicine","start":2147.92,"duration":3.52},{"text":"um i think for other readouts really","start":2149.44,"duration":3.76},{"text":"depend on the disease like","start":2151.44,"duration":4.88},{"text":"um kind of i think the general point","start":2153.2,"duration":3.84},{"text":"there is like","start":2156.32,"duration":2.48},{"text":"disease is complicated so there's many","start":2157.04,"duration":3.44},{"text":"proxies people use","start":2158.8,"duration":4.0},{"text":"so kind of the hierarchy of proxies is","start":2160.48,"duration":4.08},{"text":"if you have a pure test tube which is","start":2162.8,"duration":2.799},{"text":"you know molecules","start":2164.56,"duration":3.279},{"text":"that's like the weakest if you have","start":2165.599,"duration":4.0},{"text":"cells that's a little better","start":2167.839,"duration":3.76},{"text":"if you have a rat that's a little better","start":2169.599,"duration":3.361},{"text":"but i think the gold standard of course","start":2171.599,"duration":2.081},{"text":"is like","start":2172.96,"duration":4.0},{"text":"the human um so this is you can think of","start":2173.68,"duration":4.0},{"text":"this as like","start":2176.96,"duration":2.48},{"text":"it's better than the pure test tube but","start":2177.68,"duration":4.0},{"text":"it's absolutely not the same as like","start":2179.44,"duration":5.52},{"text":"uh but yeah as a human but it is a","start":2181.68,"duration":6.159},{"text":"useful kind of proxy","start":2184.96,"duration":2.879},{"text":"so okay so then what the machine","start":2188.0,"duration":4.72},{"text":"learning does is kind of find properties","start":2189.68,"duration":5.28},{"text":"based on the mic the images from the","start":2192.72,"duration":4.08},{"text":"microscope","start":2194.96,"duration":4.96},{"text":"so i think that the way i like to think","start":2196.8,"duration":3.68},{"text":"about it","start":2199.92,"duration":3.04},{"text":"is that the machine learning is kind of","start":2200.48,"duration":4.16},{"text":"like making a better microscope","start":2202.96,"duration":4.879},{"text":"um so in many ways like you know if you","start":2204.64,"duration":4.719},{"text":"go back to kind of classical signal","start":2207.839,"duration":2.641},{"text":"processing like","start":2209.359,"duration":3.121},{"text":"we have all these you know 48 transforms","start":2210.48,"duration":3.52},{"text":"you

first","start":2221.359,"duration":3.441},{"text":"place","start":2223.359,"duration":4.321},{"text":"well you had purely non purely kind of","start":2224.8,"duration":5.6},{"text":"optical microscopes back in the day","start":2227.68,"duration":4.64},{"text":"but in the last century i think there's","start":2230.4,"duration":3.199},{"text":"been a lot of signal processing attached","start":2232.32,"duration":2.799},{"text":"to it so i think of deep learning in","start":2233.599,"duration":2.401},{"text":"these applications","start":2235.119,"duration":3.761},{"text":"as signal processing you know turned up","start":2236.0,"duration":3.359},{"text":"to","start":2238.88,"duration":3.199},{"text":"11. so you can pull things out of the","start":2239.359,"duration":4.161},{"text":"image that you didn't","start":2242.079,"duration":2.961},{"text":"there's no obvious way to write down","start":2243.52,"duration":4.24},{"text":"that function like um","start":2245.04,"duration":5.36},{"text":"so i think right now it's more like this","start":2247.76,"duration":4.319},{"text":"really fascinating scientific thing","start":2250.4,"duration":2.08},{"text":"isn't","start":2252.079,"duration":1.361},{"text":"you know there's got to be something","start":2252.48,"duration":2.639},{"text":"there like but i want to make sure i'm","start":2253.44,"duration":3.6},{"text":"like picture like i want to have a","start":2255.119,"duration":3.921},{"text":"mental model so like maybe that was","start":2257.04,"duration":3.039},{"text":"evocative of like","start":2259.04,"duration":3.44},{"text":"did i kill the tumor cells so is the","start":2260.079,"duration":4.241},{"text":"point that like the machine learning","start":2262.48,"duration":3.76},{"text":"could tell me if the tumor cells were","start":2264.32,"duration":3.519},{"text":"killed without me having to actually","start":2266.24,"duration":3.76},{"text":"look at it or is it that the machine","start":2267.839,"duration":3.52},{"text":"learning like see something deeper that","start":2270.0,"duration":2.32},{"text":"like i couldn't","start":2271.359,"duration":4.961},{"text":"figure out if i if i looked at it so","start":2272.32,"duration":5.6},{"text":"i'll have to apologize up front because","start":2276.32,"duration":4.16},{"text":"i'm not an expert at cellular biology","start":2277.92,"duration":6.159},{"text":"but i'll try to so for example","start":2280.48,"duration":6.4},{"text":"i think for some i might be making this","start":2284.079,"duration":4.081},{"text":"up so if there's real biologists that","start":2286.88,"duration":2.4},{"text":"are eventually listening to this please","start":2288.16,"duration":2.56},{"text":"bear with me no it's a machine learning","start":2289.28,"duration":4.24},{"text":"audience you can you can pontificate","start":2290.72,"duration":4.639},{"text":"um but i think okay so i think you take","start":2293.52,"duration":3.2},{"text":"something by the way i think machine","start":2295.359,"duration":3.201},{"text":"learning people will be really familiar","start":2296.72,"duration":3.92},{"text":"with the idea of like just looking at","start":2298.56,"duration":3.44},{"text":"results and not worrying about the","start":2300.64,"duration":2.88},{"text":"process behind it so this i feel like","start":2302.0,"duration":2.16},{"text":"this is really","start":2303.52,"duration":2.16},{"text":"appealing to our machine learning","start":2304.16,"duration":4.0},{"text":"audience you know","start":2305.68,"duration":4.32},{"text":"i do have to say i still have no idea","start":2308.16,"duration":3.76},{"text":"about what happens deep in layer 37 of","start":2310.0,"duration":2.96},{"text":"my column that","start":2311.92,"duration":4.08},{"text":"um but you know i i think kind of coming","start":2312.96,"duration":3.68},{"text":"back there so","start":2316.0,"duration":2.24},{"text":"imagine you have a muscle cell and you","start":2316.64,"duration":3.36},{"text":"can often measure like","start":2318.24,"duration":4.16},{"text":"some measure of like the stretchiness of","start":2320.0,"duration":3.359},{"text":"the muscle cell","start":2322.4,"duration":4.4},{"text":"like is there's often ways to kind of","start":2323.359,"duration":6.641},{"text":"guess at a proxy for healthiness um","start":2326.8,"duration":5.52},{"text":"i i think the the the actual thing you","start":2330.0,"duration":5.2},{"text":"measure depends a lot on the biology of","start":2332.32,"duration":6.08},{"text":"the system so i think","start":2335.2,"duration":3.2},{"text":"like for example like one common thing","start":2338.88,"duration":3.68},{"text":"is that you might","start":2341.359,"duration":3.601},{"text":"you know there's these things called","start":2342.56,"duration":4.0},{"text":"fluorescent reporters","start":2344.96,"duration":4.0},{"text":"uh and you can set you can engineer the","start":2346.56,"duration":3.519},{"text":"cell so that","start":2348.96,"duration":2.639},{"text":"you know if you have the drug and it","start":2350.079,"duration":2.961},{"text":"actually hits something in the cell that","start":2351.599,"duration":2.161},{"text":"you know about","start":2353.04,"duration":2.559},{"text":"it like sets off a light here it's you","start":2353.76,"duration":3.12},{"text":"have to know a little bit about what's","start":2355.599,"duration":2.721},{"text":"happening inside the cell you have to","start":2356.88,"duration":2.0},{"text":"have a guess","start":2358.32,"duration":3.36},{"text":"already um i think the cruder version","start":2358.88,"duration":3.92},{"text":"might be like you know you have this","start":2361.68,"duration":2.64},{"text":"muscle cell you're looking at","start":2362.8,"duration":3.12},{"text":"you know maybe there's some measure of","start":2364.32,"duration":3.759},{"text":"how stretchy it is oftentimes","start":2365.92,"duration":5.36},{"text":"like oftentimes it's just like kind of","start":2368.079,"duration":4.161},{"text":"obvious to the eye","start":2371.28,"duration":3.12},{"text":"it's like that traditional like you know","start":2372.24,"duration":3.52},{"text":"you know a dog when you see it as in","start":2374.4,"duration":2.719},{"text":"you see the healthy cells they have some","start":2375.76,"duration":2.88},{"text":"like nice geometric shape it looks good","start":2377.119,"duration":2.48},{"text":"then you see like","start":2378.64,"duration":2.4},{"text":"disease and they're all like shriveled","start":2379.599,"duration":3.121},{"text":"up and just looks bad","start":2381.04,"duration":3.039},{"text":"and you can't quite write down that","start":2382.72,"duration":2.72},{"text":"function but you kind of know when you","start":2384.079,"duration":2.0},{"text":"look at it","start":2385.44,"duration":3.2},{"text":"yeah totally so it makes sense to call","start":2386.079,"duration":4.481},{"text":"nuts can begin to pick this up","start":2388.64,"duration":4.64},{"text":"right and i guess i've seen versions of","start":2390.56,"duration":4.24},{"text":"like cancer cells and like kind of","start":2393.28,"duration":2.96},{"text":"different levels and","start":2394.8,"duration":5.12},{"text":"um what do they call them like biopsies","start":2396.24,"duration":6.72},{"text":"where you look at the the cells this is","start":2399.92,"duration":4.96},{"text":"ninth grade biology sorry i should","start":2402.96,"duration":3.84},{"text":"cut this out but i just i yeah i guess i","start":2404.88,"duration":3.36},{"text":"could picture what you're saying of like","start":2406.8,"duration":2.08},{"text":"the","start":2408.24,"duration":2.879},{"text":"there's like healthy cells and but so","start":2408.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"but is the point then","start":2411.119,"duration":4.0},{"text":"i guess what what my question is like","start":2412.72,"duration":4.0},{"text":"what is the machine learning","start":2415.119,"duration":3.281},{"text":"helping with like is it is it sort of","start":2416.72,"duration":3.04},{"text":"like reducing","start":2418.4,"duration":4.16},{"text":"the cost of looking at this stuff or is","start":2419.76,"duration":4.4},{"text":"it like pulling out other signals that","start":2422.56,"duration":2.88},{"text":"are somehow","start":2424.16,"duration":4.159},{"text":"like useful i think it's a bit of both","start":2425.44,"duration":3.44},{"text":"um","start":2428.319,"duration":2.721},{"text":"so i think traditionally like uh the","start":2428.88,"duration":3.76},{"text":"traditional labor was you'd have a grad","start":2431.04,"duration":2.72},{"text":"student who","start":2432.64,"duration":2.56},{"text":"whose painful job it is if you're","start":2433.76,"duration":2.559},{"text":"unfortunate enough to be stuck in this","start":2435.2,"duration":2.159},{"text":"lab to look at","start":2436.319,"duration":4.081},{"text":"upsell one two three ten thousand um","start":2437.359,"duration":5.441},{"text":"and now i think that it's often there","start":2440.4,"duration":4.08},{"text":"are i think a number of","start":2442.8,"duration":3.039},{"text":"readouts whereas that thing where you","start":2444.48,"duration":2.639},{"text":"just look at you kind of know there's a","start":2445.839,"duration":2.161},{"text":"difference so","start":2447.119,"duration":2.641},{"text":"i think you can train yourself to like","start":2448.0,"duration":4.079},{"text":"read these things whereas i think this","start":2449.76,"duration":3.68},{"text":"is again i think a lot like you know the","start":2452.079,"duration":3.52},{"text":"pinterest example you brought up where","start":2453.44,"duration":6.399},{"text":"you're training the model to um","start":2455.599,"duration":5.76},{"text":"basically pick out something and you do","start":2459.839,"duration":3.361},{"text":"it a bigger scale so maybe","start":2461.359,"duration":3.521},{"text":"before i could only test ten thousand","start":2463.2,"duration":3.52},{"text":"because you know the grad student union","start":2464.88,"duration":2.479},{"text":"would revolt","start":2466.72,"duration":3.359},{"text":"at that point um but now you know maybe","start":2467.359,"duration":3.841},{"text":"i can test a billion","start":2470.079,"duration":3.201},{"text":"uh or i'm limited more by you know my","start":2471.2,"duration":4.159},{"text":"supplies i i think the second question","start":2473.28,"duration":3.92},{"text":"you ask is actually the more","start":2475.359,"duration":3.681},{"text":"exciting one isn't is it possible we can","start":2477.2,"duration":3.68},{"text":"pick out something we didn't know","start":2479.04,"duration":5.44},{"text":"so i i think there's glimmers that this","start":2480.88,"duration":5.6},{"text":"is yes i know there's a few page","start":2484.48,"duration":3.92},{"text":"papers that are doing things like you","start":2486.48,"duration":3.68},{"text":"can identify where the organelles are","start":2488.4,"duration":3.36},{"text":"you can begin to do","start":2490.16,"duration":4.0},{"text":"some more complex readout but i i think","start":2491.76,"duration":3.359},{"text":"there is sort of","start":2494.16,"duration":2.4},{"text":"almost a chicken and neck problem here","start":2495.119,"duration":3.681},{"text":"as in like you're","start":2496.56,"duration":3.36},{"text":"when you're discovering something you","start":2498.8,"duration":3.36},{"text":"kind of have to like","start":2499.92,"duration":3.84},{"text":"it's like unsupervised learning right if","start":2502.16,"duration":2.8},{"text":"you know the thing you're looking for","start":2503.76,"duration":2.0},{"text":"then you can like","start":2504.96,"duration":2.56},{"text":"slot it into buckets pretty easily but","start":2505.76,"duration":3.839},{"text":"then if it's like you want to go deeper","start":2507.52,"duration":5.12},{"text":"and find something you don't know","start":2509.599,"duration":5.681},{"text":"so i think yes i think there are likely","start":2512.64,"duration":3.92},{"text":"places that con nuts","start":2515.28,"duration":3.44},{"text":"you

i","start":2876.96,"duration":2.56},{"text":"always say this but","start":2878.64,"duration":2.08},{"text":"really i'm curious how you're gonna","start":2879.52,"duration":3.2},{"text":"answer these

people","start":2884.8,"duration":4.0},{"text":"should pay more attention to","start":2886.559,"duration":4.721},{"text":"what comes to mind that's a really

think there's these really","start":2903.28,"duration":3.6},{"text":"exciting things going on where","start":2905.119,"duration":3.281},{"text":"you know machine learning is like","start":2906.88,"duration":3.28},{"text":"finding its way into instruments like","start":2908.4,"duration":4.0},{"text":"into sequencers into

to","start":2933.28,"duration":3.279},{"text":"discover a new fundamental science","start":2934.64,"duration":4.0},{"text":"so that's something i'm very excited by","start":2936.559,"duration":3.76},{"text":"but it's kind of a longer","start":2938.64,"duration":4.0},{"text":"you know um we might have the instrument","start":2940.319,"duration":3.681},{"text":"when we still need you know the einstein","start":2942.64,"duration":2.64},{"text":"or something to come in and","start":2944.0,"duration":3.68},{"text":"you know work that and really get us uh","start":2945.28,"duration":3.52},{"text":"that magical","start":2947.68,"duration":2.48},{"text":"new

answer","start":2952.319,"duration":2.401},{"text":"but i guess they might give so many","start":2953.28,"duration":2.88},{"text":"readings that it's like hard to

i","start":3168.0,"duration":5.44},{"text":"sometimes you just try seven things like","start":3171.28,"duration":3.839},{"text":"uh you're trying the transfer

at","start":3232.0,"duration":3.52},{"text":"this but um yeah this may be the sort of","start":3233.44,"duration":3.28},{"text":"thing that like","start":3235.52,"duration":2.559},{"text":"you know if

my model is like it's amazing","start":1337.34,"duration":6.9},{"text":"and like it has exist accuracy what does","start":1340.28,"duration":6.09},{"text":"it even mean and for example like","start":1344.24,"duration":4.41},{"text":"somebody showed me this model is it like","start":1346.37,"duration":4.29},{"text":"my tips accuracy and I said I Wow if","start":1348.65,"duration":3.57},{"text":"it's just my pretty good grandma it was","start":1350.66,"duration":4.68},{"text":"like in select night like 89 percent","start":1352.22,"duration":5.16},{"text":"accuracy already so what's the hope what","start":1355.34,"duration":5.1},{"text":"is a point by getting this so so base","start":1357.38,"duration":6.81},{"text":"lies or I think they may slice and then","start":1360.44,"duration":7.56},{"text":"mark to help you localize and where the","start":1364.19,"duration":7.59},{"text":"model for - and why I want to get you so","start":1368.0,"duration":5.07},{"text":"looking very interesting a human base","start":1371.78,"duration":4.139},{"text":"life for example like what what if","start":1373.07,"duration":5.099},{"text":"humans do I missed it I said I how well","start":1375.919,"duration":5.491},{"text":"it could do so it's like maybe saying","start":1378.169,"duration":5.88},{"text":"90% is also a really amazing it's a","start":1381.41,"duration":5.31},{"text":"human base life is like 85% so we say oh","start":1384.049,"duration":6.451},{"text":"it is like superhuman performance but","start":1386.72,"duration":6.0},{"text":"even sight is a human base like 99% and","start":1390.5,"duration":3.84},{"text":"we know that we still have a lot of","start":1392.72,"duration":5.699},{"text":"about to go right yeah right so it's","start":1394.34,"duration":5.49},{"text":"like the human baseline it's kind of","start":1398.419,"duration":5.421},{"text":"like maybe in some sense like best-case","start":1399.83,"duration":8.07},{"text":"yeah yeah it's in some places in a lot","start":1403.84,"duration":6.49},{"text":"of places to the humans base lies Oracle","start":1407.9,"duration":5.909},{"text":"but it's not always yeah right","start":1410.33,"duration":5.219},{"text":"do you want to talk another thing I'm","start":1413.809,"duration":4.441},{"text":"kind of curious about is is your your","start":1415.549,"duration":4.911},{"text":"work on every just because I think like","start":1418.25,"duration":4.86},{"text":"you know fake news is probably gonna be","start":1420.46,"duration":4.57},{"text":"a big topic again with the election","start":1423.11,"duration":5.67},{"text":"coming up I think this is a fun

like","start":1431.69,"duration":5.4},{"text":"I think echo chamber can also help like","start":1433.85,"duration":5.84},{"text":"echoing like fake news right I feel like","start":1437.09,"duration":5.4},{"text":"the same thing news release according to","start":1439.69,"duration":8.05},{"text":"see the same echo chamber and and you","start":1442.49,"duration":8.16},{"text":"know like if if on echo chambers shares","start":1447.74,"duration":6.09},{"text":"a certain piece of news and now the echo","start":1450.65,"duration":5.31},{"text":"chamber shares similar news work with","start":1453.83,"duration":4.05},{"text":"different posts but this might be some","start":1455.96,"duration":4.11},{"text":"I'm not sure how helpful is gonna be but","start":1457.88,"duration":4.049},{"text":"is it might be interesting to

another","start":1464.749,"duration":4.53},{"text":"echo chamber not fake news of course is","start":1466.7,"duration":4.349},{"text":"no point in a spreading fitness from one","start":1469.279,"duration":5.4},{"text":"the Koshien bought you another so so","start":1471.049,"duration":6.87},{"text":"what we did was that we we got a lot of","start":1474.679,"duration":7.35},{"text":"tweets and from hashtag so so as that","start":1477.919,"duration":6.24},{"text":"time whistle after the election so we we","start":1482.029,"duration":4.171},{"text":"collected a lot of tweets from from","start":1484.159,"duration":3.781},{"text":"during the elections in one certain","start":1486.2,"duration":4.679},{"text":"state and what we did was we have some","start":1487.94,"duration":5.699},{"text":"seat hashtags that we know was like","start":1490.879,"duration":5.64},{"text":"where there is a pro Republicans or","start":1493.639,"duration":6.691},{"text":"pro-democratic so from those seat hashed","start":1496.519,"duration":5.91},{"text":"hash tags we have we miss exemptions","start":1500.33,"duration":6.329},{"text":"that if one if two hashtags belong in","start":1502.429,"duration":7.141},{"text":"the same tweet then they are likely has","start":1506.659,"duration":8.1},{"text":"a same sentiment right like for ya so","start":1509.57,"duration":8.25},{"text":"it's like if one hash tag appears next","start":1514.759,"duration":5.191},{"text":"to and hashtags that program quickens","start":1517.82,"duration":3.449},{"text":"and it's likely to be so bleep","start":1519.95,"duration":5.01},{"text":"Republican so so from that we we had","start":1521.269,"duration":6.571},{"text":"Anchorage which is like just to resolve","start":1524.96,"duration":6.03},{"text":"conflicts it's very simple in

thousand","start":1535.129,"duration":6.811},{"text":"hashtags and so firms is hashtag so we","start":1538.07,"duration":5.88},{"text":"win some expansion sure I understand so","start":1541.94,"duration":3.66},{"text":"you label the hashtags is like liberal","start":1543.95,"duration":4.079},{"text":"or conservative essentially yes what","start":1545.6,"duration":5.22},{"text":"they co-occurs with yes yes so after","start":1548.029,"duration":4.65},{"text":"that some so we look on the trip so we","start":1550.82,"duration":5.76},{"text":"do a graph of friendship token users for","start":1552.679,"duration":7.141},{"text":"somebody if if user a reply to you or","start":1556.58,"duration":6.419},{"text":"like retweet and now that users is a","start":1559.82,"duration":5.849},{"text":"link between them so will be a graph of","start":1562.999,"duration":5.971},{"text":"users and we also look was a kind of the","start":1565.669,"duration":6.39},{"text":"hashtags they use and so we're trying to","start":1568.97,"duration":5.339},{"text":"predict whether a person is liberal or","start":1572.059,"duration":4.891},{"text":"conservative and and then we look us and","start":1574.309,"duration":4.98},{"text":"then we use some graph algorithms to","start":1576.95,"duration":5.549},{"text":"detect communities and then we look at","start":1579.289,"duration":5.821},{"text":"the comedies and see like whether this","start":1582.499,"duration":7.081},{"text":"company is have much more conservatives","start":1585.11,"duration":6.96},{"text":"and liberal and it was very fascinating","start":1589.58,"duration":5.88},{"text":"because when we found as I'd like","start":1592.07,"duration":5.69},{"text":"about 50% of the Communists without are","start":1595.46,"duration":5.25},{"text":"like neutral like like there's a","start":1597.76,"duration":7.06},{"text":"difference between between the number of","start":1600.71,"duration":6.66},{"text":"conservative liberals it's not it's not","start":1604.82,"duration":5.28},{"text":"that high but then about 25% of them are","start":1607.37,"duration":4.2},{"text":"like conservative first of all like the","start":1610.1,"duration":5.13},{"text":"number of conservative members like more","start":1611.57,"duration":6.359},{"text":"than 3 times higher than like Democrat","start":1615.23,"duration":7.819},{"text":"and Macias 25% Democrat yeah community","start":1617.929,"duration":9.661},{"text":"so you found the echo chambers so which","start":1623.049,"duration":6.521},{"text":"houses like I'm not sure was it a coach","start":1627.59,"duration":4.89},{"text":"amber but but it's neffie like people","start":1629.57,"duration":5.19},{"text":"who share similar beliefs I definitely","start":1632.48,"duration":4.699},{"text":"have stronger ties and people with

have","start":2248.94,"duration":4.74},{"text":"like they have like several like so a","start":2252.119,"duration":3.841},{"text":"lot of graph like","start":2253.68,"duration":4.52},{"text":"or GCN

like","start":2370.38,"duration":5.16},{"text":"monitoring so like it's just not","start":2372.21,"duration":5.61},{"text":"experiment tracking or training but like","start":2375.54,"duration":4.44},{"text":"monitoring it's a real war it deploys","start":2377.82,"duration":4.44},{"text":"system how do you monitor it like how

second","start":2394.56,"duration":12.5},{"text":"question is in your experience taking","start":2404.82,"duration":5.79},{"text":"projects from like training into","start":2407.06,"duration":5.44},{"text":"approached and deployed systems where's","start":2410.61,"duration":3.03},{"text":"the biggest bottleneck like what's the","start":2412.5,"duration":7.83},{"text":"hardest step in that um one is like","start":2413.64,"duration":9.51},{"text":"creating right now is when you have very","start":2420.33,"duration":5.72},{"text":"big models it's really slow to","start":2423.15,"duration":8.34},{"text":"inferencing yeah yeah it's very slow and","start":2426.05,"duration":7.48},{"text":"it can be very costly","start":2431.49,"duration":5.88},{"text":"so so for example like if you try to","start":2433.53,"duration":7.53},{"text":"take my GPU to go into productions and","start":2437.37,"duration":6.9},{"text":"you just even you spot instances isn't","start":2441.06,"duration":5.37},{"text":"so it cost quite a bit for every","start":2444.27,"duration":4.29},{"text":"inference things like for for every time","start":2446.43,"duration":3.42},{"text":"you make a prediction like you know","start":2448.56,"duration":4.8},{"text":"generate something so so yeah so so","start":2449.85,"duration":6.63},{"text":"that's hard like if you just like so yes","start":2453.36,"duration":5.55},{"text":"ask why we haven't seen a lot of gt2 in","start":2456.48,"duration":6.33},{"text":"production yet right and it's very","start":2458.91,"duration":6.12},{"text":"interesting problem so like I'm not sure","start":2462.81,"duration":5.25},{"text":"if I can mention the exact company but","start":2465.03,"duration":5.72},{"text":"but some sort of told me was it using","start":2468.06,"duration":9.42},{"text":"gt2 in productions and ones and they say","start":2470.75,"duration":9.58},{"text":"like if they could reduce inference time","start":2477.48,"duration":3.66},{"text":"by half","start":2480.33,"duration":3.36},{"text":"they could be able to break even so like","start":2481.14,"duration":6.03},{"text":"so I first know if they can instead of","start":2483.69,"duration":6.84},{"text":"using the novel precision point if they","start":2487.17,"duration":6.06},{"text":"can somehow make it works on for some","start":2490.53,"duration":6.27},{"text":"epi16 I have precision point then it can","start":2493.23,"duration":5.94},{"text":"reduce inference time by half and","start":2496.8,"duration":5.52},{"text":"therefore when when I help the

I","start":217.81,"duration":6.209},{"text":"was an undergrad I worked in physics and","start":220.51,"duration":7.979},{"text":"neuroscience and so machine learning was","start":224.019,"duration":6.871},{"text":"I think kind of seen as vudu","start":228.489,"duration":5.28},{"text":"to to those folks back then so there was","start":230.89,"duration":4.77},{"text":"this thing called you know you would do","start":233.769,"duration":4.891},{"text":"D convolution of signal so I worked on a","start":235.66,"duration":6.9},{"text":"project it was a summer project we were","start":238.66,"duration":6.389},{"text":"working on antimatter which is just","start":242.56,"duration":3.209},{"text":"sounds cool right","start":245.049,"duration":6.421},{"text":"but positronium is it's it's basically a","start":245.769,"duration":10.231},{"text":"positron an electron that forms an atom","start":251.47,"duration":6.54},{"text":"kind of like hydrogen except with

taking","start":260.65,"duration":4.019},{"text":"these measurements real world sensor","start":262.9,"duration":2.58},{"text":"data","start":264.669,"duration":2.761},{"text":"you're trying to detect

each","start":269.95,"duration":4.56},{"text":"other eventually they annihilate right","start":272.47,"duration":4.53},{"text":"and it gives off radiation and so you","start":274.51,"duration":4.56},{"text":"have all these sensors and equipment set","start":277.0,"duration":4.35},{"text":"up to measure that annihilation but the","start":279.07,"duration":4.14},{"text":"problem is all everything that you're","start":281.35,"duration":5.91},{"text":"using to measure it it pollutes the","start":283.21,"duration":5.58},{"text":"signal right so what you actually","start":287.26,"duration":4.56},{"text":"measure is this convolution of the raw","start":288.79,"duration":5.58},{"text":"data with those signals and so at the","start":291.82,"duration":5.52},{"text":"time you know my task one of my

one","start":299.5,"duration":5.76},{"text":"of the kind of core machine learning","start":303.07,"duration":4.77},{"text":"problems from back in the day it's kind","start":305.26,"duration":4.8},{"text":"of like the cocktail party problem you","start":307.84,"duration":4.29},{"text":"have a bunch of people speaking and you","start":310.06,"duration":4.08},{"text":"need to disentangle who's you know the","start":312.13,"duration":5.61},{"text":"different voices in a recording anyway","start":314.14,"duration":5.37},{"text":"so that's actually what I think I first","start":317.74,"duration":4.19},{"text":"got that and the work that I did in","start":319.51,"duration":4.71},{"text":"neuroscience I was really interested in","start":321.93,"duration":4.86},{"text":"neural networks basically right and","start":324.22,"duration":6.66},{"text":"interested in you know process I found","start":326.79,"duration":5.38},{"text":"the processing of the data more","start":330.88,"duration":2.91},{"text":"interesting than the actual experiments","start":332.17,"duration":3.45},{"text":"which are you know a lot of hard work","start":333.79,"duration":5.55},{"text":"and a lot of time in the lab so I really","start":335.62,"duration":6.68},{"text":"just dug deeply into signal processing","start":339.34,"duration":6.9},{"text":"and machine learning and so before I got","start":342.3,"duration":6.34},{"text":"to AOL and I actually had two other","start":346.24,"duration":5.64},{"text":"roles where I cut my teeth on big data","start":348.64,"duration":5.55},{"text":"sets the the first one was actually back","start":351.88,"duration":6.36},{"text":"in the first dot-com crash it was a","start":354.19,"duration":5.79},{"text":"company called profit logic and they","start":358.24,"duration":3.36},{"text":"were ended up getting acquired by Oracle","start":359.98,"duration":4.26},{"text":"and became Oracle retail but we","start":361.6,"duration":4.17},{"text":"basically this is back in the day when","start":364.24,"duration":3.78},{"text":"they'd ship the data to you on tapes so","start":365.77,"duration":5.52},{"text":"if you had a customer to get access to","start":368.02,"duration":3.81},{"text":"their data","start":371.29,"duration":1.92},{"text":"people say it's hard

but","start":375.1,"duration":2.97},{"text":"back then we actually had to get tapes","start":376.51,"duration":5.04},{"text":"of data sent to us and so a lot of","start":378.07,"duration":4.47},{"text":"point-of-sale data","start":381.55,"duration":3.45},{"text":"retail sale data and we are building","start":382.54,"duration":6.03},{"text":"predictive

these","start":398.92,"duration":5.13},{"text":"kinds of things how do you detect and","start":401.44,"duration":5.69},{"text":"measure and prevent these kinds

predictive","start":416.32,"duration":7.56},{"text":"modeling in the first dot-com boom yeah","start":419.65,"duration":5.1},{"text":"what I mean","start":423.88,"duration":2.61},{"text":"so you get tapes like how big is the","start":424.75,"duration":3.81},{"text":"data and like what is your what kind of","start":426.49,"duration":3.51},{"text":"models are you building what's your like","start":428.56,"duration":3.33},{"text":"- yeah it's that like I mean I've got","start":430.0,"duration":3.6},{"text":"that's a long time ago so I get her","start":431.89,"duration":4.41},{"text":"thinking back you know what's funny we","start":433.6,"duration":4.29},{"text":"were actually using Python right so","start":436.3,"duration":4.14},{"text":"we're using Python and C++ and so at","start":437.89,"duration":4.74},{"text":"that time I think almost nobody was","start":440.44,"duration":5.15},{"text":"using Python right yeah yeah all right","start":442.63,"duration":6.12},{"text":"Google that's right so Google it was it","start":445.59,"duration":4.63},{"text":"was kind of Google and then like a","start":448.75,"duration":3.69},{"text":"handful of other startups around that","start":450.22,"duration":6.21},{"text":"you know late 90s early 2000s but in the","start":452.44,"duration":6.48},{"text":"enterprise Python was not really widely","start":456.43,"duration":4.2},{"text":"adopted yet","start":458.92,"duration":5.25},{"text":"but you know this was really you know","start":460.63,"duration":6.0},{"text":"close to the metal kind of work because","start":464.17,"duration":4.26},{"text":"you know you get the data I don't","start":466.63,"duration":3.66},{"text":"remember the exact volume but you can","start":468.43,"duration":3.96},{"text":"imagine like a customer like Walmart","start":470.29,"duration":4.59},{"text":"right you know they have thousands of","start":472.39,"duration":6.75},{"text":"stores thousands of products and each of","start":474.88,"duration":6.6},{"text":"those products has different sizes and","start":479.14,"duration":6.3},{"text":"colors and styles so those it's really","start":481.48,"duration":5.76},{"text":"at the SKU store level was the the","start":485.44,"duration":4.08},{"text":"granularity of data and then every","start":487.24,"duration":4.23},{"text":"transaction so similar to you know what","start":489.52,"duration":3.36},{"text":"something like Square might have now","start":491.47,"duration":3.42},{"text":"right where you have you know somebody","start":492.88,"duration":3.93},{"text":"buys a coffee you get that transaction a","start":494.89,"duration":4.77},{"text":"little event but at the time you know","start":496.81,"duration":5.1},{"text":"the lag was really long right so these","start":499.66,"duration":4.83},{"text":"are brick-and-mortar retailers and so","start":501.91,"duration":4.29},{"text":"they were mostly running on oracle or","start":504.49,"duration":4.68},{"text":"db2 or something like that and they","start":506.2,"duration":4.77},{"text":"would have you know their point-of-sale","start":509.17,"duration":3.75},{"text":"system and then that would be aggregated","start":510.97,"duration":4.68},{"text":"up all that raw data usually to","start":512.92,"duration":5.1},{"text":"something like you know this shirt there","start":515.65,"duration":5.4},{"text":"it would be a SKU and if you look at the","start":518.02,"duration":5.37},{"text":"sales of that SKU you could see the","start":521.05,"duration":5.79},{"text":"sales nationally and then typically what","start":523.39,"duration":4.68},{"text":"would happen is you know there's","start":526.84,"duration":3.72},{"text":"markdowns so two weeks in you lower the","start":528.07,"duration":3.81},{"text":"price and then there's","start":530.56,"duration":3.27},{"text":"sales bump depending on the elasticity","start":531.88,"duration":5.55},{"text":"of the item the price elasticity and so","start":533.83,"duration":4.89},{"text":"really the machine learning problem","start":537.43,"duration":3.96},{"text":"there was okay the first few days","start":538.72,"duration":4.05},{"text":"actually I think we cut it pretty close","start":541.39,"duration":3.96},{"text":"so we had a week turnaround time we","start":542.77,"duration":4.71},{"text":"would get the raw data and then we would","start":545.35,"duration":5.16},{"text":"run our models so some Python C++ models","start":547.48,"duration":5.85},{"text":"to do forecasting and optimization and","start":550.51,"duration":6.09},{"text":"model fitting and then we would","start":553.33,"duration":5.16},{"text":"basically want to spit back price","start":556.6,"duration":4.95},{"text":"recommendations so for every SKU were","start":558.49,"duration":5.52},{"text":"saying we're telling the retailer hey","start":561.55,"duration":6.03},{"text":"Mark it down 10% market down 15% so that","start":564.01,"duration":5.13},{"text":"you'll optimize sales over the entire","start":567.58,"duration":6.42},{"text":"season and many times what that what","start":569.14,"duration":6.54},{"text":"ended up happening is it would take you","start":574.0,"duration":3.33},{"text":"know a few days to load load the data","start":575.68,"duration":4.32},{"text":"we'd have to get the data from tapes","start":577.33,"duration":4.29},{"text":"we'd have to load it there could be an","start":580.0,"duration":4.59},{"text":"issue there then you have to get it into","start":581.62,"duration":5.97},{"text":"our models run the models which would I","start":584.59,"duration":4.77},{"text":"think that could take like a day or two","start":587.59,"duration":6.15},{"text":"at that time and then at the end of the","start":589.36,"duration":7.14},{"text":"day this is gonna sound really bad but","start":593.74,"duration":6.12},{"text":"QA at that point in time looked like so","start":596.5,"duration":4.68},{"text":"the final product we would send was","start":599.86,"duration":4.2},{"text":"basically a CSV report that would go to","start":601.18,"duration":4.41},{"text":"the retailer that they would then put","start":604.06,"duration":3.09},{"text":"into their point-of-sale system or","start":605.59,"duration":4.92},{"text":"they're buying system but there were","start":607.15,"duration":5.28},{"text":"some nights where we actually would just","start":610.51,"duration":3.21},{"text":"print out the CSVs","start":612.43,"duration":4.35},{"text":"and like look at them and and then mark","start":613.72,"duration":5.61},{"text":"hey this looks wrong you know with the","start":616.78,"duration":5.52},{"text":"marker and then go back and actually go","start":619.33,"duration":5.82},{"text":"in with python and fix and change the","start":622.3,"duration":6.18},{"text":"models and those are late nights and","start":625.15,"duration":4.83},{"text":"what was your title at that point like","start":628.48,"duration":4.43},{"text":"what did they call you I think back then","start":629.98,"duration":5.07},{"text":"it was kind of like being a glorified","start":632.91,"duration":5.07},{"text":"grad student but I think my title was","start":635.05,"duration":6.78},{"text":"analyst or data analyst but data","start":637.98,"duration":6.7},{"text":"scientists didn't come around until what","start":641.83,"duration":7.37},{"text":"like 2009 or 2010 right so but there was","start":644.68,"duration":6.96},{"text":"and then but then you you actually were","start":649.2,"duration":4.81},{"text":"on the you were in the original data","start":651.64,"duration":4.62},{"text":"scientists at LinkedIn in the early days","start":654.01,"duration":5.37},{"text":"yeah yeah but the like a team that I","start":656.26,"duration":5.22},{"text":"think everyone's gone on to do really","start":659.38,"duration":3.99},{"text":"awesome stuff","start":661.48,"duration":4.14},{"text":"how did you how did you come","start":663.37,"duration":6.5},{"text":"crosslinked in that early like what yeah","start":665.62,"duration":8.55},{"text":"so after I did the stuff at MIT I went","start":669.87,"duration":7.93},{"text":"back and I did some neural network grad","start":674.17,"duration":9.419},{"text":"work at MIT and then I was at a well

year","start":685.24,"duration":3.87},{"text":"after I left profit logic that they got","start":687.339,"duration":3.75},{"text":"acquired and said I think I kind of got","start":689.11,"duration":5.34},{"text":"bit by the startup bug when I saw you","start":691.089,"duration":5.881},{"text":"know hey there is a light at the end of","start":694.45,"duration":5.73},{"text":"the tunnel these things can work and so","start":696.97,"duration":5.22},{"text":"I was eager to get into

a","start":724.12,"duration":3.15},{"text":"company you would get all these linked","start":725.77,"duration":4.05},{"text":"invites from your co-workers and I","start":727.27,"duration":4.08},{"text":"hadn't created an account yet so this is","start":729.82,"duration":4.709},{"text":"back this must have been like 2008 I got","start":731.35,"duration":5.64},{"text":"LinkedIn by 8:00 signed up and I","start":734.529,"duration":3.991},{"text":"actually I liked the product there was a","start":736.99,"duration":3.12},{"text":"group you know groups was a bigger","start":738.52,"duration":4.11},{"text":"feature back then so I you I I was on a","start":740.11,"duration":4.53},{"text":"lot of the early like Hadoop groups and","start":742.63,"duration":4.31},{"text":"machine learning groups on LinkedIn","start":744.64,"duration":4.319},{"text":"connected with a lot of people and so I","start":746.94,"duration":3.88},{"text":"think that's how we actually met was","start":748.959,"duration":4.471},{"text":"maybe the Mike Driscoll had like a big","start":750.82,"duration":5.389},{"text":"data community back then it was blogging","start":753.43,"duration":6.36},{"text":"and he went on to found Metamarkets","start":756.209,"duration":5.831},{"text":"but yeah so LinkedIn basically I came","start":759.79,"duration":4.26},{"text":"out to the Bay Area and you know like a","start":762.04,"duration":4.08},{"text":"lot of people you know was interviewing","start":764.05,"duration":4.43},{"text":"talking to a bunch of different startups","start":766.12,"duration":6.65},{"text":"LinkedIn was interesting to me because I","start":768.48,"duration":7.359},{"text":"think a big reason was Reed Hoffman the","start":772.77,"duration":8.17},{"text":"founder is really big on networks right","start":775.839,"duration":9.151},{"text":"and I was a big believer in the power of","start":780.94,"duration":7.56},{"text":"networks and connecting you know

was a big believer in the mission of","start":799.64,"duration":6.36},{"text":"LinkedIn specifically because it's","start":803.18,"duration":5.55},{"text":"unfortunately relevant again now there I","start":806.0,"duration":3.84},{"text":"think there's nothing more meaningful","start":808.73,"duration":3.15},{"text":"you can do thing then gets one a job","start":809.84,"duration":7.71},{"text":"right and people working on things that","start":811.88,"duration":8.85},{"text":"is important to them and fulfilling and","start":817.55,"duration":4.89},{"text":"that map it feels like it matters I","start":820.73,"duration":5.43},{"text":"think is really important and so it","start":822.44,"duration":5.22},{"text":"seemed like a great opportunity to","start":826.16,"duration":3.75},{"text":"leverage data like they had massed","start":827.66,"duration":5.01},{"text":"amassed this large data set of all these","start":829.91,"duration":5.37},{"text":"people their profiles their connections","start":832.67,"duration":4.47},{"text":"but they hadn't really flipped that","start":835.28,"duration":3.93},{"text":"switch yet that like machine learning or","start":837.14,"duration":4.95},{"text":"data science switch to leverage it to","start":839.21,"duration":5.79},{"text":"have impact and that was just beginning","start":842.09,"duration":5.16},{"text":"when I got there so what were the early","start":845.0,"duration":4.7},{"text":"projects like what were you doing there","start":847.25,"duration":6.0},{"text":"yeah so it was interesting a lot of the","start":849.7,"duration":7.6},{"text":"core elements that you see today were","start":853.25,"duration":7.14},{"text":"there at that point so there was a","start":857.3,"duration":5.48},{"text":"profile you could connect to people","start":860.39,"duration":4.86},{"text":"there was an early version of people you","start":862.78,"duration":4.54},{"text":"may know so Jonathan Goldman was the","start":865.25,"duration":4.29},{"text":"first data scientist who built that but","start":867.32,"duration":4.83},{"text":"back then it was running on sequel so it","start":869.54,"duration":4.02},{"text":"was like a big secret query that would","start":872.15,"duration":3.42},{"text":"take I don't know like a few days to run","start":873.56,"duration":5.46},{"text":"or series of sequel queries and the","start":875.57,"duration":4.83},{"text":"network was much smaller so I think","start":879.02,"duration":2.52},{"text":"there were only maybe like 10 million","start":880.4,"duration":3.48},{"text":"members or something at that point now","start":881.54,"duration":4.35},{"text":"there's probably like over 500 million I","start":883.88,"duration":4.11},{"text":"don't know the latest number I'm","start":885.89,"duration":4.86},{"text":"LinkedIn but at that point the data was","start":887.99,"duration":5.25},{"text":"small enough that you could sort of make","start":890.75,"duration":4.32},{"text":"that work but I think it would take I","start":893.24,"duration":4.35},{"text":"think would actually take over a week to","start":895.07,"duration":4.91},{"text":"run people you may know at that point","start":897.59,"duration":6.33},{"text":"and so some of the first products I","start":899.98,"duration":7.63},{"text":"worked on the first one actually DJ","start":903.92,"duration":5.37},{"text":"Patel who was running the team at the","start":907.61,"duration":4.2},{"text":"time I was lucky enough based on some of","start":909.29,"duration":3.81},{"text":"the stuff I had done before he gave me a","start":911.81,"duration":4.17},{"text":"bit of latitude and he said you know","start":913.1,"duration":4.8},{"text":"just come up with a new product come up","start":915.98,"duration":3.39},{"text":"with something that you think we should","start":917.9,"duration":6.66},{"text":"do and we'll pitch it to the board and","start":919.37,"duration":7.38},{"text":"so what I came up with was LinkedIn","start":924.56,"duration":5.07},{"text":"skills so at this time I was still","start":926.75,"duration":6.86},{"text":"basically an Icee data data scientist","start":929.63,"duration":8.82},{"text":"product manager type person so I pitched","start":933.61,"duration":8.56},{"text":"this idea of hey you know like skills","start":938.45,"duration":5.16},{"text":"seems like an obvious thing you should","start":942.17,"duration":3.93},{"text":"have as an element of somebody's profile","start":943.61,"duration":4.02},{"text":"and there's all these other cool things","start":946.1,"duration":2.79},{"text":"we could do with it we could use it in","start":947.63,"duration":3.99},{"text":"search and ad targeting but we could","start":948.89,"duration":4.98},{"text":"also you like you could endorse each","start":951.62,"duration":4.47},{"text":"other for skills things like that so we","start":953.87,"duration":3.54},{"text":"have these early notions that we could","start":956.09,"duration":5.22},{"text":"do stuff like that but the first task is","start":957.41,"duration":5.25},{"text":"how do you beat strap something like","start":961.31,"duration":3.75},{"text":"that so I'd say the first year was","start":962.66,"duration":4.14},{"text":"basically bootstrapping and building","start":965.06,"duration":4.74},{"text":"that from scratch and so we put put a","start":966.8,"duration":3.6},{"text":"team together","start":969.8,"duration":3.26},{"text":"Jake wraps who's the co-founder of","start":970.4,"duration":5.13},{"text":"confluent he was my first engineering","start":973.06,"duration":5.77},{"text":"partner on that project and then Sam","start":975.53,"duration":6.45},{"text":"Shaw who rewrote from sequel to","start":978.83,"duration":5.13},{"text":"MapReduce the that people you may know","start":981.98,"duration":4.29},{"text":"was then my second engineering partner","start":983.96,"duration":3.9},{"text":"and he became my co-founder later at a","start":986.27,"duration":5.37},{"text":"startup skip flag that we did but that","start":987.86,"duration":5.58},{"text":"was the first big project it was","start":991.64,"duration":4.71},{"text":"actually a how did you bootstrap it yeah","start":993.44,"duration":5.64},{"text":"so actually crowdsourcing came in I","start":996.35,"duration":4.44},{"text":"think we may have used CrowdFlower we","start":999.08,"duration":6.56},{"text":"definitely use Mechanical Turk basically","start":1000.79,"duration":7.83},{"text":"it was it was it was a mix of different","start":1005.64,"duration":4.84},{"text":"things so we have in maybe in the show","start":1008.62,"duration":4.14},{"text":"notes I can give you some references for","start":1010.48,"duration":5.99},{"text":"papers on how we did it yeah the the","start":1012.76,"duration":7.02},{"text":"core prototype I actually built in I","start":1016.47,"duration":6.58},{"text":"think a few weeks and I really just","start":1019.78,"duration":5.58},{"text":"slapped it together with duct tape again","start":1023.05,"duration":6.09},{"text":"some Python you know Sai PI I think yeah","start":1025.36,"duration":5.55},{"text":"scikit-learn existed but it was still","start":1029.14,"duration":6.45},{"text":"pretty nascent at the time and Map","start":1030.91,"duration":7.23},{"text":"Reduce right so LinkedIn the stack back","start":1035.59,"duration":6.99},{"text":"then looked like Hadoop Pig some hive","start":1038.14,"duration":8.52},{"text":"but we've mostly settled on Pig you know","start":1042.58,"duration":7.02},{"text":"which came out of Yahoo and it was","start":1046.66,"duration":4.56},{"text":"basically a bunch of batch jobs in the","start":1049.6,"duration":3.93},{"text":"the idea the trick which I had kind of","start":1051.22,"duration":5.25},{"text":"picked up when I was at AOL AOL I was","start":1053.53,"duration":4.86},{"text":"working on mining patterns from search","start":1056.47,"duration":5.31},{"text":"query data and then crawling external","start":1058.39,"duration":5.37},{"text":"websites and trying to actually","start":1061.78,"duration":3.69},{"text":"understand the topics in those sites you","start":1063.76,"duration":3.0},{"text":"can imagine like","start":1065.47,"duration":3.24},{"text":"if you're on TripAdvisor what are the","start":1066.76,"duration":3.81},{"text":"topics on

in","start":1073.14,"duration":5.14},{"text":"search queries so I'd spend a lot of","start":1076.21,"duration":3.87},{"text":"time working on NLP and information","start":1078.28,"duration":3.78},{"text":"extraction and so that was basically the","start":1080.08,"duration":5.01},{"text":"idea with to bootstrap skills we've we","start":1082.06,"duration":4.23},{"text":"had about 10 or 12 million","start":1085.09,"duration":5.63},{"text":"english-language profiles and basically","start":1086.29,"duration":8.61},{"text":"it was a bit like word to vac but","start":1090.72,"duration":9.1},{"text":"pre-work to vac extracting commonly","start":1094.9,"duration":8.4},{"text":"co-occurring phrases from those profiles","start":1099.82,"duration":5.7},{"text":"and then getting a bunch of candidates","start":1103.3,"duration":4.14},{"text":"for named entities essentially from the","start":1105.52,"duration":4.71},{"text":"raw text and from those candidates for","start":1107.44,"duration":6.75},{"text":"named entities again similar to how a","start":1110.23,"duration":5.43},{"text":"lot of people do name down in these now","start":1114.19,"duration":7.11},{"text":"they use Wikipedia or deep you know wiki","start":1115.66,"duration":8.19},{"text":"data or things like that as a source

in","start":1127.45,"duration":5.1},{"text":"Wikipedia then I could I could normalize","start":1130.21,"duration":5.67},{"text":"those so if you say ror or Ruby on Rails","start":1132.55,"duration":7.11},{"text":"or rails we can disambiguate or we could","start":1135.88,"duration":5.94},{"text":"disambiguate those at linkedin down to","start":1139.66,"duration":5.22},{"text":"be you know the same entity and so it","start":1141.82,"duration":4.92},{"text":"was a really primitive in in some sense","start":1144.88,"duration":5.16},{"text":"form of things that we went on to do at","start":1146.74,"duration":6.15},{"text":"our startup skip flag but wait wait so","start":1150.04,"duration":5.73},{"text":"you just you used Wikipedia to pull in","start":1152.89,"duration":7.17},{"text":"the skills No so we would use that as a","start":1155.77,"duration":8.1},{"text":"I guess I would say it's kind of a means","start":1160.06,"duration":5.94},{"text":"of normalizing the things that people","start":1163.87,"duration":4.2},{"text":"would say on their profile so you could","start":1166.0,"duration":3.57},{"text":"you could you named and it's basically","start":1168.07,"duration":3.48},{"text":"named any disambiguation so if somebody","start":1169.57,"duration":5.37},{"text":"says a phrase like let's say angel right","start":1171.55,"duration":5.19},{"text":"yeah so if you say angel do you mean","start":1174.94,"duration":4.08},{"text":"you're an angel investor or you there","start":1176.74,"duration":4.44},{"text":"are people on LinkedIn who do psychic","start":1179.02,"duration":3.96},{"text":"healing and can say they can talk

use","start":1185.83,"duration":6.75},{"text":"Wikipedia figure like ontology the","start":1189.87,"duration":3.46},{"text":"ontology","start":1192.58,"duration":2.64},{"text":"yeah so basically the knowledge graph","start":1193.33,"duration":5.49},{"text":"like it was complicated so that not","start":1195.22,"duration":5.49},{"text":"everything is in Wikipedia it's","start":1198.82,"duration":3.69},{"text":"- the notability criterion for creating","start":1200.71,"duration":4.829},{"text":"a Wikipedia entity is pretty high so a","start":1202.51,"duration":5.22},{"text":"lot of jargon a lot of domain-specific","start":1205.539,"duration":4.62},{"text":"stuff is not in Wikipedia so we would","start":1207.73,"duration":5.4},{"text":"only use that as a as a like you could","start":1210.159,"duration":5.971},{"text":"let's say you weights and biases people","start":1213.13,"duration":3.99},{"text":"start putting that on their LinkedIn","start":1216.13,"duration":1.74},{"text":"profile","start":1217.12,"duration":3.15},{"text":"that's an emerging

lot","start":1223.09,"duration":6.0},{"text":"more evidence and data for tagging right","start":1224.77,"duration":5.909},{"text":"because really what you want to do yeah","start":1229.09,"duration":3.18},{"text":"would you like manually review new","start":1230.679,"duration":2.97},{"text":"skills sound like how would you know say","start":1232.27,"duration":2.879},{"text":"like weights and biases becomes like a","start":1233.649,"duration":3.75},{"text":"skill people want to put how would that","start":1235.149,"duration":4.65},{"text":"I would never even created a new one","start":1237.399,"duration":5.4},{"text":"yeah so initially it was a combination","start":1239.799,"duration":5.88},{"text":"so we would have an automated skill","start":1242.799,"duration":6.51},{"text":"discovery you know job that would detect","start":1245.679,"duration":5.791},{"text":"emerging topics that probably were","start":1249.309,"duration":7.59},{"text":"skills and then we also had like this

and","start":1764.37,"duration":4.29},{"text":"workplace software we still really dumb","start":1766.32,"duration":3.66},{"text":"right so you're building all these

stupid","start":1778.35,"duration":4.74},{"text":"right and so what I really wanted to do","start":1779.85,"duration":4.68},{"text":"was you know apply some of that","start":1783.09,"duration":4.98},{"text":"technology you know to those workplace","start":1784.53,"duration":4.8},{"text":"problems and more specifically

I","start":1792.18,"duration":4.25},{"text":"think that it's not as obvious when","start":1796.49,"duration":6.31},{"text":"you're in these larger companies where","start":1800.37,"duration":5.85},{"text":"you've hit scale everybody specializes","start":1802.8,"duration":6.0},{"text":"and you have you know there was a

the","start":1841.08,"duration":5.52},{"text":"reality hits them that you know wow","start":1844.59,"duration":4.44},{"text":"there's actually a lot to build and

to","start":1918.75,"duration":4.89},{"text":"give you their like slack logs and like","start":1921.0,"duration":4.26},{"text":"do it for them or like how didn't even","start":1923.64,"duration":4.039},{"text":"like build an ml gun without the data","start":1925.26,"duration":4.68},{"text":"yeah so that's the chicken and egg","start":1927.679,"duration":5.38},{"text":"problem so I'm a little OCD when it","start":1929.94,"duration":6.71},{"text":"comes to data and data sets so back","start":1933.059,"duration":7.831},{"text":"maybe like 2007 or 2008 I wrote a blog","start":1936.65,"duration":6.67},{"text":"post some datasets available on the

like","start":2202.579,"duration":3.061},{"text":"that so we did that we did that","start":2203.779,"duration":5.881},{"text":"prototype and to do that you know we had","start":2205.64,"duration":6.659},{"text":"other auxilary datasets and we could do","start":2209.66,"duration":3.899},{"text":"a bit of transfer learning and things","start":2212.299,"duration":3.111},{"text":"like that so we had the Wikipedia corpus","start":2213.559,"duration":4.351},{"text":"common crawl which is you know a

it","start":2240.17,"duration":5.929},{"text":"oh yeah yeah I left the N record sake","start":2246.579,"duration":4.87},{"text":"actually came much later so we started","start":2249.499,"duration":3.631},{"text":"with slack we did the email digests and","start":2251.449,"duration":3.27},{"text":"then in parallel we were building

it","start":2304.28,"duration":3.69},{"text":"became an open data set she curated it","start":2306.11,"duration":5.07},{"text":"put it out there anyway long

for","start":2346.37,"duration":5.52},{"text":"sure no and I was totally the same way","start":2348.98,"duration":6.42},{"text":"so I think we were very you know so that","start":2351.89,"duration":4.71},{"text":"was one of the things sometimes you","start":2355.4,"duration":3.3},{"text":"could work with the customer and it's","start":2356.6,"duration":3.48},{"text":"their own data right so you're","start":2358.7,"duration":5.19},{"text":"processing the data and a lot like","start":2360.08,"duration":5.4},{"text":"sometimes it would happen where we would","start":2363.89,"duration":3.39},{"text":"turn on you know say that email digest","start":2365.48,"duration":3.87},{"text":"or that product and people would say","start":2367.28,"duration":4.02},{"text":"okay I changed my mind let's turn this","start":2369.35,"duration":6.06},{"text":"off and because they didn't realize you","start":2371.3,"duration":6.18},{"text":"know maybe it's like customer

a","start":2531.65,"duration":4.17},{"text":"data set out there there were two or","start":2534.23,"duration":3.21},{"text":"three data sets in the academic world","start":2535.82,"duration":4.08},{"text":"that were search query logs and so AOL","start":2537.44,"duration":3.87},{"text":"basically released one in the

happen","start":2543.47,"duration":8.4},{"text":"but what ended up happening was reddit","start":2547.06,"duration":6.46},{"text":"you this is in the early days of reddit","start":2551.87,"duration":5.13},{"text":"too right so I remember I was actually","start":2553.52,"duration":5.25},{"text":"looking at reddit on the weekend when I","start":2557.0,"duration":3.84},{"text":"just started this job and I saw on the","start":2558.77,"duration":3.6},{"text":"you know in the new page where emerging","start":2560.84,"duration":3.75},{"text":"stories are popping up I saw this story","start":2562.37,"duration":4.95},{"text":"AOL released his search logs and in some","start":2564.59,"duration":4.53},{"text":"user I don't know if they were the first","start":2567.32,"duration":3.63},{"text":"person to see it on reddit or if it was","start":2569.12,"duration":5.46},{"text":"a reporter but someone on reddit like","start":2570.95,"duration":5.76},{"text":"said hey check this out their search","start":2574.58,"duration":3.84},{"text":"queries here and then what happened was","start":2576.71,"duration":3.09},{"text":"a whole bunch of people started putting","start":2578.42,"duration":3.87},{"text":"up sites where they put a web app in","start":2579.8,"duration":4.5},{"text":"front of the search query logs and you","start":2582.29,"duration":4.62},{"text":"could go in and like explore like crazy","start":2584.3,"duration":6.09},{"text":"queries and it was you know query query","start":2586.91,"duration":6.09},{"text":"session logs are deeply private and","start":2590.39,"duration":4.08},{"text":"sensitive things so even if you remove","start":2593.0,"duration":3.57},{"text":"the user ID this is what the world","start":2594.47,"duration":3.96},{"text":"discovered basically when that happened","start":2596.57,"duration":5.1},{"text":"hey it was a wake up call I think a lot","start":2598.43,"duration":4.41},{"text":"of people in technology already knew","start":2601.67,"duration":2.79},{"text":"that obviously this stuff could be","start":2602.84,"duration":4.29},{"text":"sensitive but I think for a lot of the","start":2604.46,"duration":5.22},{"text":"world it was a wake-up call that you","start":2607.13,"duration":7.38},{"text":"know what I type in to my browser goes","start":2609.68,"duration":9.24},{"text":"somewhere and it can have an impact and","start":2614.51,"duration":6.84},{"text":"so if you think about the advice back in","start":2618.92,"duration":5.52},{"text":"the early 2000s dealing with Google the","start":2621.35,"duration":4.71},{"text":"general advice out there was always","start":2624.44,"duration":4.02},{"text":"Google your name like every few weeks","start":2626.06,"duration":4.47},{"text":"you should Google your name to make sure","start":2628.46,"duration":3.51},{"text":"that there isn't something bad in the","start":2630.53,"duration":3.39},{"text":"internet about you or you know whatever","start":2631.97,"duration":4.5},{"text":"you like reputation management but","start":2633.92,"duration":4.41},{"text":"actually what that means then is in","start":2636.47,"duration":3.86},{"text":"those anonymized search query logs","start":2638.33,"duration":4.05},{"text":"usually the one of the more common","start":2640.33,"duration":3.31},{"text":"things that people were googling was","start":2642.38,"duration":3.24},{"text":"actually their name right so then that","start":2643.64,"duration":4.62},{"text":"made it fairly easy to triangulate in","start":2645.62,"duration":5.91},{"text":"many cases individuals and so that's","start":2648.26,"duration":6.27},{"text":"what ended up happening was so that li","start":2651.53,"duration":5.85},{"text":"the search data set was taken down and","start":2654.53,"duration":4.68},{"text":"and I think it we entered into this","start":2657.38,"duration":3.06},{"text":"period where it was much more difficult","start":2659.21,"duration":3.54},{"text":"for academia like you mentioned the","start":2660.44,"duration":3.24},{"text":"Enron data set","start":2662.75,"duration":2.55},{"text":"I don't think something like that would","start":2663.68,"duration":3.9},{"text":"happen today you wouldn't have an Enron","start":2665.3,"duration":3.75},{"text":"data set you wouldn't have the a wall","start":2667.58,"duration":2.48},{"text":"search logs","start":2669.05,"duration":4.2},{"text":"and and so it became much more lockdown","start":2670.06,"duration":4.75},{"text":"I think the Netflix prize data set was","start":2673.25,"duration":5.73},{"text":"one of the last big ones yeah and their","start":2674.81,"duration":5.1},{"text":"member there's complaints right it's","start":2678.98,"duration":3.24},{"text":"like they I think Netflix didn't","start":2679.91,"duration":3.84},{"text":"actually do a follow up to their","start":2682.22,"duration":3.06},{"text":"competition right because there was","start":2683.75,"duration":3.03},{"text":"privacy","start":2685.28,"duration":3.96},{"text":"yeah were brought up soon yeah I mean it","start":2686.78,"duration":4.11},{"text":"did yeah it was a good run right and","start":2689.24,"duration":3.72},{"text":"then that was kind of correlated with","start":2690.89,"duration":4.67},{"text":"the birth of rebirth of deep learning","start":2692.96,"duration":4.53},{"text":"because I remember I was actually","start":2695.56,"duration":5.08},{"text":"working on that on the side when it was","start":2697.49,"duration":5.94},{"text":"going on so I think I was at AOL at the","start":2700.64,"duration":5.04},{"text":"time and I was working on the Netflix","start":2703.43,"duration":6.87},{"text":"prize and I was in all the forums and it","start":2705.68,"duration":6.24},{"text":"was like this was before kaggle but it","start":2710.3,"duration":3.21},{"text":"was basically one of the first you know","start":2711.92,"duration":3.18},{"text":"there were the data mining competitions","start":2713.51,"duration":3.69},{"text":"and then there was a Netflix prize and","start":2715.1,"duration":4.41},{"text":"then there was Kaggle and it was really","start":2717.2,"duration":5.33},{"text":"interesting to see the progress

that","start":3495.36,"duration":4.05},{"text":"happens I mean a lot of folks have","start":3498.03,"duration":3.24},{"text":"talked about it that that we've

right","start":3508.98,"duration":4.59},{"text":"like what I do hear this over and over","start":3511.5,"duration":3.66},{"text":"so yeah there must be something going on","start":3513.57,"duration":4.32},{"text":"but what do you think it is I think some","start":3515.16,"duration":5.43},{"text":"of it is just lack of familiarity with","start":3517.89,"duration":7.17},{"text":"the domain so in some ways unfortunately","start":3520.59,"duration":6.06},{"text":"it's like blockchain right so

a","start":3528.72,"duration":4.11},{"text":"blockchain story so I think when these","start":3530.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"things start top-down sometimes that","start":3532.83,"duration":5.04},{"text":"happens so the company may say okay our","start":3534.72,"duration":6.93},{"text":"board is pushing us to you know have","start":3537.87,"duration":6.39},{"text":"blockchain strategy and then they get","start":3541.65,"duration":4.68},{"text":"some consultants in maybe or you know","start":3544.26,"duration":4.95},{"text":"they have internal execs come up with","start":3546.33,"duration":5.1},{"text":"something and then I think when

the","start":3552.72,"duration":3.84},{"text":"executive support don't get me wrong but","start":3554.52,"duration":3.36},{"text":"I think you do need the

a","start":3561.12,"duration":4.41},{"text":"product management like shines so I","start":3562.47,"duration":4.59},{"text":"think if you have a good product

a","start":3583.98,"duration":4.59},{"text":"business outcome but you know like you","start":3585.18,"duration":4.59},{"text":"said earlier","start":3588.57,"duration":2.37},{"text":"you know with ml

plan","start":3593.52,"duration":6.05},{"text":"around that level of uncertainty yeah so","start":3595.59,"duration":5.79},{"text":"there there are a number of different","start":3599.57,"duration":3.28},{"text":"strategies one of them one of the ones","start":3601.38,"duration":5.21},{"text":"that I'm really honing in on lately

you","start":3609.84,"duration":4.23},{"text":"know","start":3613.65,"duration":2.54},{"text":"Netflix used for the Netflix prize and","start":3614.07,"duration":3.87},{"text":"you know all the data mining","start":3616.19,"duration":3.25},{"text":"competitions used for years which is","start":3617.94,"duration":5.85},{"text":"benchmarks so I think if you you know if","start":3619.44,"duration":6.12},{"text":"you have a clear you'd go back to video","start":3623.79,"duration":4.62},{"text":"recommendation again Netflix said you","start":3625.56,"duration":4.68},{"text":"know created a data set a benchmark data","start":3628.41,"duration":5.55},{"text":"set and released you know held back some","start":3630.24,"duration":6.81},{"text":"test data set and released you know","start":3633.96,"duration":5.7},{"text":"training data for people to train models","start":3637.05,"duration":3.9},{"text":"and then had a clear set of the","start":3639.66,"duration":3.66},{"text":"valuation metrics and they said here's","start":3640.95,"duration":3.93},{"text":"you know current state of the art or","start":3643.32,"duration":2.97},{"text":"what it what is in production right now","start":3644.88,"duration":3.71},{"text":"and we're gonna pay a million dollars","start":3646.29,"duration":5.28},{"text":"for the first team to get a 10%","start":3648.59,"duration":4.39},{"text":"improvement I think it was ten percent I","start":3651.57,"duration":5.76},{"text":"remember and so that makes a the nice","start":3652.98,"duration":6.27},{"text":"thing and this will appeal to I think a","start":3657.33,"duration":5.01},{"text":"lot of product managers they like clear","start":3659.25,"duration":6.09},{"text":"objectives and goals that people can","start":3662.34,"duration":4.8},{"text":"rally around that your team can

can't","start":3669.93,"duration":3.99},{"text":"construct that benchmark and and I'm","start":3672.06,"duration":3.39},{"text":"it's surprising the number of teams that","start":3673.92,"duration":3.39},{"text":"actually skip ahead they just don't even","start":3675.45,"duration":4.38},{"text":"bother with that right they just they","start":3677.31,"duration":3.72},{"text":"may have some business metrics I'm","start":3679.83,"duration":4.08},{"text":"measuring but they and they may have","start":3681.03,"duration":4.47},{"text":"model metrics that they're using","start":3683.91,"duration":3.63},{"text":"internally but they're not really","start":3685.5,"duration":4.47},{"text":"connecting those in a clear way and","start":3687.54,"duration":4.41},{"text":"they're not doing it like for example","start":3689.97,"duration":3.36},{"text":"it's like testing in production right","start":3691.95,"duration":3.57},{"text":"they may do something where they have an","start":3693.33,"duration":4.44},{"text":"a\/b test and they say hey when we rolled","start":3695.52,"duration":4.8},{"text":"out this new model code we in our a B","start":3697.77,"duration":5.19},{"text":"task we saw you know a 5% left so it's","start":3700.32,"duration":5.16},{"text":"better than the old one good job work on","start":3702.96,"duration":4.98},{"text":"the next model and if you're if you're","start":3705.48,"duration":4.74},{"text":"doing that it's very easy to fool","start":3707.94,"duration":4.53},{"text":"yourself and it's very hard to debug","start":3710.22,"duration":3.96},{"text":"right so that's where the uncertainty","start":3712.47,"duration":3.99},{"text":"creeps in is you don't really know where","start":3714.18,"duration":4.68},{"text":"you stand you don't know well was there","start":3716.46,"duration":3.84},{"text":"something else happening in the data","start":3718.86,"duration":3.75},{"text":"during that time period that you know","start":3720.3,"duration":3.16},{"text":"affected the MA","start":3722.61,"duration":3.61},{"text":"if we reran that same model on new data","start":3723.46,"duration":5.7},{"text":"what we get

frame","start":3730.569,"duration":5.49},{"text":"this it's really critical that you build","start":3733.089,"duration":5.911},{"text":"those benchmarks and that you you know","start":3736.059,"duration":5.581},{"text":"hold out some data set some some stream","start":3739.0,"duration":4.859},{"text":"of traffic for example and you

know","start":3758.74,"duration":4.589},{"text":"like ml teams feels a little different","start":3761.98,"duration":3.03},{"text":"than stand-ups with an engineering team","start":3763.329,"duration":2.851},{"text":"because it's kind of like but the jig","start":3765.01,"duration":2.46},{"text":"seems like hey I did this feature I did","start":3766.18,"duration":4.11},{"text":"this feature but then with an ml team","start":3767.47,"duration":4.05},{"text":"it's a little harder right like do you","start":3770.29,"duration":3.45},{"text":"have any any thoughts are on that yeah","start":3771.52,"duration":5.7},{"text":"yeah so I think I you know I've","start":3773.74,"duration":5.129},{"text":"mentioned this on Twitter a few times as","start":3777.22,"duration":3.27},{"text":"well and it's interesting to see that a","start":3778.869,"duration":3.511},{"text":"discussion that people have around this","start":3780.49,"duration":4.92},{"text":"so I think a lot of data scientists it","start":3782.38,"duration":8.07},{"text":"resonates in that and some of them may","start":3785.41,"duration":7.889},{"text":"just be understanding the nature of

then","start":3795.549,"duration":4.53},{"text":"how to translate that into that kind of","start":3798.19,"duration":5.19},{"text":"stand-up format I think you see the","start":3800.079,"duration":5.551},{"text":"clash of cultures right immediately in a","start":3803.38,"duration":5.01},{"text":"stand-up because often people have

I","start":3829.72,"duration":4.77},{"text":"implemented you know that you know API","start":3832.45,"duration":4.59},{"text":"that will talk to you know the email","start":3834.49,"duration":5.04},{"text":"system and you know it we're all set and","start":3837.04,"duration":5.85},{"text":"it's it's in testing that's very","start":3839.53,"duration":5.13},{"text":"different from you know the data they","start":3842.89,"duration":3.09},{"text":"get to the data scientists in the stand","start":3844.66,"duration":4.37},{"text":"up and they say well you know I'm still","start":3845.98,"duration":6.359},{"text":"you know training the model and you know","start":3849.03,"duration":4.539},{"text":"something's not working but I'm not","start":3852.339,"duration":2.821},{"text":"quite sure what it is I'm gonna look","start":3853.569,"duration":3.491},{"text":"into you","start":3855.16,"duration":3.76},{"text":"you know the initial initialization","start":3857.06,"duration":3.87},{"text":"parameters and maybe try to optimize","start":3858.92,"duration":5.1},{"text":"that and I'll report back next time and","start":3860.93,"duration":4.77},{"text":"then repeat right and it's always","start":3864.02,"duration":3.63},{"text":"something until the mark the model isn't","start":3865.7,"duration":3.98},{"text":"working until it's working unfortunately","start":3867.65,"duration":4.14},{"text":"and so I think that can create some","start":3869.68,"duration":4.96},{"text":"stress maybe it's just me but I I feel","start":3871.79,"duration":6.39},{"text":"that stress and so in terms of","start":3874.64,"duration":7.23},{"text":"strategies to deal with that for product","start":3878.18,"duration":6.57},{"text":"managers I think it I think it's at","start":3881.87,"duration":5.13},{"text":"least good to call it out and so I think","start":3884.75,"duration":4.26},{"text":"if you don't talk about it it can get it","start":3887.0,"duration":4.86},{"text":"can start to seem strange so I think","start":3889.01,"duration":5.52},{"text":"it's at least worth calling out and this","start":3891.86,"duration":4.29},{"text":"gets to the point of like organizational","start":3894.53,"duration":5.55},{"text":"support for these ml projects if you","start":3896.15,"duration":7.23},{"text":"listen to chatter you know there's all","start":3900.08,"duration":5.64},{"text":"kinds of apps for you know back channels","start":3903.38,"duration":3.75},{"text":"now and there's slack and there's

and","start":3915.65,"duration":5.07},{"text":"pressure I think increasingly you're","start":3917.66,"duration":5.37},{"text":"gonna have this chatter which is already","start":3920.72,"duration":4.44},{"text":"there around hey what are those ml","start":3923.03,"duration":4.02},{"text":"people actually doing right they're","start":3925.16,"duration":4.38},{"text":"getting these big paychecks like where's","start":3927.05,"duration":3.06},{"text":"the beef","start":3929.54,"duration":3.87},{"text":"what are they delivering and so this is","start":3930.11,"duration":4.44},{"text":"where that I think this is critical","start":3933.41,"duration":3.27},{"text":"critically important and like stand-ups","start":3934.55,"duration":4.74},{"text":"I think it would be good to have you","start":3936.68,"duration":4.98},{"text":"know more of a clarity around what","start":3939.29,"duration":5.07},{"text":"should machine learning folks report in","start":3941.66,"duration":3.48},{"text":"stand-ups","start":3944.36,"duration":3.09},{"text":"and make it clear that the progress","start":3945.14,"duration":4.08},{"text":"meter is going to be a little different","start":3947.45,"duration":4.23},{"text":"and it may be research results like","start":3949.22,"duration":5.18},{"text":"here's the objective we had this week","start":3951.68,"duration":4.68},{"text":"you know here are the things that we","start":3954.4,"duration":4.21},{"text":"wanted to put in place and you know we","start":3956.36,"duration":3.87},{"text":"accomplished them even if the results","start":3958.61,"duration":3.66},{"text":"are not there I think if you say hey","start":3960.23,"duration":3.87},{"text":"we're gonna improve by 5% this week and","start":3962.27,"duration":3.66},{"text":"and that's that's our goal for the","start":3964.1,"duration":3.51},{"text":"standup that that can be very hard","start":3965.93,"duration":5.13},{"text":"because you may not hit it it's funny we","start":3967.61,"duration":6.66},{"text":"had Chris Alban on this show also he was","start":3971.06,"duration":4.77},{"text":"talking about a lot about sort of I","start":3974.27,"duration":3.63},{"text":"forgot to put it but like I'm creating a","start":3975.83,"duration":4.77},{"text":"sense of like emotional security for his","start":3977.9,"duration":4.65},{"text":"ml team and I think a big part of that","start":3980.6,"duration":5.22},{"text":"for him was sort of you know like not","start":3982.55,"duration":7.05},{"text":"focusing people too much on you know","start":3985.82,"duration":5.07},{"text":"this sort of like external","start":3989.6,"duration":4.62},{"text":"five percent increased skills I have to","start":3990.89,"duration":5.699},{"text":"say you know he he made some sense but I","start":3994.22,"duration":4.349},{"text":"think in I was a little bit of convinced","start":3996.589,"duration":3.69},{"text":"for myself I mean I feel like if someone","start":3998.569,"duration":3.661},{"text":"you know like running a company under","start":4000.279,"duration":4.651},{"text":"pressure I do feel like um I feel like","start":4002.23,"duration":4.319},{"text":"for me yeah like I think like the way","start":4004.93,"duration":6.359},{"text":"that I run my teams is pretty sort of","start":4006.549,"duration":7.77},{"text":"external metrics focused yeah but I","start":4011.289,"duration":4.29},{"text":"think there's downsides to it for sure","start":4014.319,"duration":3.03},{"text":"and it's it's it's very hard to know","start":4015.579,"duration":5.551},{"text":"like what a reasonable goal is so yeah I","start":4017.349,"duration":7.23},{"text":"go back and forth I I think so I think","start":4021.13,"duration":5.13},{"text":"it varies depending on the stage of the","start":4024.579,"duration":4.171},{"text":"project and of the company so when","start":4026.26,"duration":3.69},{"text":"they're just starting with machine","start":4028.75,"duration":3.21},{"text":"learning I think the hard reality is","start":4029.95,"duration":3.98},{"text":"it's going to be hard to get to that","start":4031.96,"duration":4.559},{"text":"number when you don't even have your ml","start":4033.93,"duration":5.349},{"text":"infrastructure in place so I think in","start":4036.519,"duration":4.921},{"text":"the early stages before you actually","start":4039.279,"duration":4.611},{"text":"have a working product in production","start":4041.44,"duration":4.589},{"text":"unfortunately it's going to be really","start":4043.89,"duration":3.399},{"text":"hard to be metrics driven so you may","start":4046.029,"duration":3.691},{"text":"have decoupled you may have like

if","start":4131.2,"duration":7.08},{"text":"you can have that data set ready to go","start":4134.59,"duration":5.73},{"text":"and get people working on a

and","start":4160.12,"duration":3.87},{"text":"we'd know what we were shooting for and","start":4162.19,"duration":3.12},{"text":"it would be like a kind of a

you","start":4173.2,"duration":4.68},{"text":"can do is just start with an MVP get","start":4174.73,"duration":5.07},{"text":"something basic in place so that you can","start":4177.88,"duration":4.53},{"text":"get on that you know a you see","start":4179.8,"duration":5.73},{"text":"improvement train and once you can

there's","start":4187.54,"duration":4.95},{"text":"progress and I think for project","start":4188.86,"duration":6.51},{"text":"planning then it becomes more clear

you","start":4197.65,"duration":3.42},{"text":"improve the AUC and then you see revenue","start":4199.24,"duration":4.26},{"text":"increase or users increase or

think","start":4249.64,"duration":8.13},{"text":"that's more important in deep R&D right","start":4254.26,"duration":4.38},{"text":"so for","start":4257.77,"duration":5.1},{"text":"if somebody hat

this","start":4325.15,"duration":3.27},{"text":"I'm not sure if I mentioned okay ours","start":4326.98,"duration":5.19},{"text":"explicitly but I do talk about you know","start":4328.42,"duration":6.09},{"text":"setting goals and setting objectives and","start":4332.17,"duration":4.65},{"text":"then how that can go wrong so I think","start":4334.51,"duration":5.13},{"text":"this is a great example I am a believer","start":4336.82,"duration":5.7},{"text":"in that general framework I think what","start":4339.64,"duration":4.92},{"text":"becomes difficult so for people who","start":4342.52,"duration":3.96},{"text":"aren't familiar with product management","start":4344.56,"duration":6.99},{"text":"via ok measurement via ok ours what","start":4346.48,"duration":6.57},{"text":"typically happens is at the beginning of","start":4351.55,"duration":4.71},{"text":"a quarter every everybody signs up for","start":4353.05,"duration":7.68},{"text":"an OK R and it's supposed to be you're","start":4356.26,"duration":5.64},{"text":"not supposed to sandbag you're not","start":4360.73,"duration":2.43},{"text":"supposed to set the bar low you're","start":4361.9,"duration":5.31},{"text":"supposed to have a reasoned ambitious","start":4363.16,"duration":6.78},{"text":"goal and so maybe and you typically have","start":4367.21,"duration":5.58},{"text":"something like 3 okrs per quarter and it","start":4369.94,"duration":5.7},{"text":"might be you know increase user signups","start":4372.79,"duration":7.62},{"text":"by you know 20% increase you know","start":4375.64,"duration":7.65},{"text":"revenue per user by you know 10%","start":4380.41,"duration":5.43},{"text":"something like that and they may be a","start":4383.29,"duration":3.9},{"text":"little more granular right so especially","start":4385.84,"duration":3.18},{"text":"in a larger company they become more","start":4387.19,"duration":3.47},{"text":"granular and it may be something like","start":4389.02,"duration":3.36},{"text":"increased search","start":4390.66,"duration":5.62},{"text":"Vince as measured by you know f1 or","start":4392.38,"duration":7.73},{"text":"whatever by you know thirty percent and","start":4396.28,"duration":9.12},{"text":"and so in any case those metrics I think","start":4400.11,"duration":6.819},{"text":"are important and I think the hard part","start":4405.4,"duration":4.92},{"text":"is among the product leaders you you","start":4406.929,"duration":6.691},{"text":"have to be very careful about how much","start":4410.32,"duration":6.3},{"text":"latitude you give on just pure ml","start":4413.62,"duration":5.73},{"text":"metrics versus business metrics because","start":4416.62,"duration":4.98},{"text":"it's very easy for teams that's how you","start":4419.35,"duration":4.68},{"text":"get this like bubble where everybody's","start":4421.6,"duration":5.73},{"text":"just doing R&D and then I think what","start":4424.03,"duration":4.649},{"text":"ends up happening is a lot of business","start":4427.33,"duration":4.05},{"text":"leaders and PMS see those okay ours and","start":4428.679,"duration":4.29},{"text":"they just shrug and say I don't","start":4431.38,"duration":3.06},{"text":"understand how that relates to the","start":4432.969,"duration":6.781},{"text":"business right but but okay ours I would","start":4434.44,"duration":7.11},{"text":"rewarding people for okay ours is pretty","start":4439.75,"duration":4.409},{"text":"standard and where that can go wrong I","start":4441.55,"duration":4.29},{"text":"think the YouTube example is one of the","start":4444.159,"duration":5.401},{"text":"best known ones where by all like okay","start":4445.84,"duration":6.24},{"text":"our metrics YouTube has been succeeding","start":4449.56,"duration":4.71},{"text":"wildly over the last you know five or","start":4452.08,"duration":5.0},{"text":"six years probably but the downside is","start":4454.27,"duration":5.369},{"text":"when you manage to a single number","start":4457.08,"duration":6.49},{"text":"it doesn't PM's become machines they're","start":4459.639,"duration":7.08},{"text":"like the the parable of AI in

are","start":4475.21,"duration":4.5},{"text":"the same way where you give them a","start":4478.389,"duration":3.33},{"text":"metric they're gonna hit it but there","start":4479.71,"duration":3.449},{"text":"may be a lot of collateral damage in the","start":4481.719,"duration":3.21},{"text":"case of YouTube there was a lot of","start":4483.159,"duration":3.871},{"text":"misinformation and conspiracy theories","start":4484.929,"duration":3.96},{"text":"because they lead to clicks so by

at","start":4491.59,"duration":3.99},{"text":"what cost","start":4494.83,"duration":3.24},{"text":"right right I guess that's a good segue","start":4495.58,"duration":5.19},{"text":"to another topic

yeah","start":4510.909,"duration":8.101},{"text":"so yeah so that's a deep deep topic so I","start":4513.55,"duration":6.439},{"text":"think","start":4519.01,"duration":2.57},{"text":"there's a

longer","start":4741.24,"duration":3.09},{"text":"yeah and they actually pull in a lot","start":4742.68,"duration":5.34},{"text":"more open source infrastructure than

and","start":4750.17,"duration":5.62},{"text":"and I I think part of it is actually","start":4753.14,"duration":5.92},{"text":"that folks want to like sort of

a","start":4765.18,"duration":5.94},{"text":"big part of it is incentives so if you","start":4768.9,"duration":4.2},{"text":"think about and this isn't just

it","start":4845.76,"duration":4.919},{"text":"to all their needs and so that's where I","start":4848.07,"duration":3.96},{"text":"think that a lot of the frameworks

use","start":4860.639,"duration":2.55},{"text":"some third party thing and it's too","start":4861.78,"duration":6.0},{"text":"rigid and then eventually you know it","start":4863.189,"duration":6.81},{"text":"causes a lot of headaches and it does","start":4867.78,"duration":4.879},{"text":"seem like a lot of the tools and sort

different","start":4880.38,"duration":5.069},{"text":"needs that other other companies might","start":4882.059,"duration":7.62},{"text":"have yeah so I think that that that part","start":4885.449,"duration":6.44},{"text":"when it comes to the infrastructure side","start":4889.679,"duration":4.86},{"text":"that's another common pattern is

five","start":4922.929,"duration":3.991},{"text":"times now I think this we should","start":4924.489,"duration":4.32},{"text":"abstract this out so that's a very","start":4926.92,"duration":5.279},{"text":"different approach than saying hey we've","start":4928.809,"duration":7.861},{"text":"never done this but let's go design what","start":4932.199,"duration":6.181},{"text":"we think the right thing is and then","start":4936.67,"duration":3.63},{"text":"build this abstract platform so I think","start":4938.38,"duration":4.949},{"text":"I agree with him I tend to think things","start":4940.3,"duration":4.77},{"text":"that grew out of real experience tend to","start":4943.329,"duration":4.801},{"text":"be better as terms of frameworks so if","start":4945.07,"duration":4.56},{"text":"you're selecting make sure

these","start":4958.449,"duration":3.63},{"text":"companies like yours building this I","start":4960.55,"duration":3.029},{"text":"mean one of the best things you can do","start":4962.079,"duration":4.741},{"text":"is just see more problems and and map","start":4963.579,"duration":4.71},{"text":"what you're doing to those

you're","start":4970.69,"duration":3.06},{"text":"gonna answer these I think they're","start":4972.67,"duration":2.699},{"text":"related a lot of stuff we talked about","start":4973.75,"duration":5.09},{"text":"but but here's my first one which is","start":4975.369,"duration":5.881},{"text":"what do you think's like the topic in","start":4978.84,"duration":4.21},{"text":"you know Dana science or machine","start":4981.25,"duration":3.179},{"text":"learning that people don't talk about","start":4983.05,"duration":3.029},{"text":"enough like the kind of underrated","start":4984.429,"duration":3.661},{"text":"saying that in your experience matters","start":4986.079,"duration":5.191},{"text":"more than people spend time thinking","start":4988.09,"duration":6.509},{"text":"about it I think it's actually","start":4991.27,"duration":7.05},{"text":"constructing good benchmarks so yeah if","start":4994.599,"duration":6.81},{"text":"if if I were to look at you know we","start":4998.32,"duration":4.77},{"text":"talked about teams that are struggling","start":5001.409,"duration":3.781},{"text":"or having trouble I would say nine times","start":5003.09,"duration":5.069},{"text":"out of ten they haven't done the hard","start":5005.19,"duration":6.63},{"text":"work to construct a crisp clean precise","start":5008.159,"duration":8.611},{"text":"benchmark and in a valuation of how well","start":5011.82,"duration":7.5},{"text":"their model is doing and so what what","start":5016.77,"duration":3.9},{"text":"often happens is people have these","start":5019.32,"duration":2.31},{"text":"notions hey I'm gonna build a","start":5020.67,"duration":2.19},{"text":"recommender I know how to do a","start":5021.63,"duration":3.239},{"text":"recommender and oh yeah we'll get this","start":5022.86,"duration":3.509},{"text":"data and people actually just start","start":5024.869,"duration":3.931},{"text":"building the model and then after the","start":5026.369,"duration":4.5},{"text":"fact maybe they label some like sample","start":5028.8,"duration":3.359},{"text":"data and they say oh this is my gold","start":5030.869,"duration":2.491},{"text":"standard okay this is how we're doing","start":5032.159,"duration":4.621},{"text":"and that that's maybe I'd say a lot of","start":5033.36,"duration":4.62},{"text":"times people don't even do that right","start":5036.78,"duration":3.99},{"text":"they just launch the thing and then it","start":5037.98,"duration":4.44},{"text":"becomes very hard or they may use proxy","start":5040.77,"duration":3.96},{"text":"metrics like did it increase lift you","start":5042.42,"duration":6.0},{"text":"know did it increase CTR and maybe a B","start":5044.73,"duration":5.67},{"text":"test to a B testing is not a benchmark","start":5048.42,"duration":4.44},{"text":"basically is what I would say so build","start":5050.4,"duration":2.76},{"text":"the","start":5052.86,"duration":2.79},{"text":"mark be rigorous about it and if at all","start":5053.16,"duration":4.08},{"text":"possible because the other thing that","start":5055.65,"duration":4.05},{"text":"happens is when things aren't working so","start":5057.24,"duration":3.99},{"text":"say you're six months in and your model","start":5059.7,"duration":3.33},{"text":"isn't working you don't know why I'm","start":5061.23,"duration":3.42},{"text":"gonna need that benchmark so that you","start":5063.03,"duration":3.12},{"text":"can debug what's going on and if you","start":5064.65,"duration":3.78},{"text":"don't have it you're gonna flail it's","start":5066.15,"duration":5.19},{"text":"funny we had we had a guy for open a I","start":5068.43,"duration":5.13},{"text":"am the podcast awhile back and he said","start":5071.34,"duration":4.23},{"text":"the exact same thing and he said he was","start":5073.56,"duration":5.82},{"text":"mentioning that the dota team spent like","start":5075.57,"duration":6.09},{"text":"six months building like a hand-tuned","start":5079.38,"duration":4.8},{"text":"benchmark just to like say here's like","start":5081.66,"duration":4.47},{"text":"sort of baseline rule based system they","start":5084.18,"duration":3.24},{"text":"really spend like six months actually","start":5086.13,"duration":3.69},{"text":"building the benchmarks yeah I mean I","start":5087.42,"duration":4.56},{"text":"don't know the exact amount of time but","start":5089.82,"duration":3.93},{"text":"at our startup I mean I I would almost","start":5091.98,"duration":3.36},{"text":"say we spent twenty to thirty percent of","start":5093.75,"duration":3.21},{"text":"our time on that kind of thing I think","start":5095.34,"duration":4.08},{"text":"it totally makes sense all right hit the","start":5096.96,"duration":5.67},{"text":"second and last question when when you","start":5099.42,"duration":5.76},{"text":"look at it's a good one for you actually","start":5102.63,"duration":4.26},{"text":"so when you look at like all the ML","start":5105.18,"duration":3.36},{"text":"projects you seen like consulted but a","start":5106.89,"duration":3.89},{"text":"part of what do you think that the","start":5108.54,"duration":5.07},{"text":"hardest part about getting them from","start":5110.78,"duration":4.72},{"text":"like a model to like a production","start":5113.61,"duration":4.59},{"text":"deployed model like like where's the the","start":5115.5,"duration":6.0},{"text":"biggest bottleneck there so from a","start":5118.2,"duration":6.18},{"text":"working model well actually no I would","start":5121.5,"duration":5.27},{"text":"say from from like sort of conception","start":5124.38,"duration":6.75},{"text":"like say here's the goal to deployed","start":5126.77,"duration":7.29},{"text":"model that people can actually use I","start":5131.13,"duration":6.96},{"text":"would say the the - I'd say there's","start":5134.06,"duration":5.29},{"text":"actually three hard parts it's hard for","start":5138.09,"duration":4.02},{"text":"me to pick just one I would say one hard","start":5139.35,"duration":5.85},{"text":"part is around actually getting the data","start":5142.11,"duration":5.79},{"text":"so a lot of companies you're asking","start":5145.2,"duration":3.6},{"text":"where did we get the data for the","start":5147.9,"duration":2.76},{"text":"startup even within companies that","start":5148.8,"duration":3.81},{"text":"seemingly have a lot of data getting the","start":5150.66,"duration":3.81},{"text":"data set you need to train the model is","start":5152.61,"duration":4.92},{"text":"often really costly and hard and there","start":5154.47,"duration":4.68},{"text":"may be a lot of internal roadblocks so","start":5157.53,"duration":3.03},{"text":"that's one where I've seen people","start":5159.15,"duration":3.84},{"text":"stumble the other hard part about","start":5160.56,"duration":5.31},{"text":"getting things to production is is then","start":5162.99,"duration":5.16},{"text":"actually the modeling approach and so I","start":5165.87,"duration":4.38},{"text":"don't believe like a lot of people out","start":5168.15,"duration":4.32},{"text":"there I see this all the time you know","start":5170.25,"duration":4.56},{"text":"in blogs and on Twitter say oh the","start":5172.47,"duration":3.81},{"text":"modeling doesn't actually matter that","start":5174.81,"duration":2.94},{"text":"much it's all these other auxilary","start":5176.28,"duration":3.36},{"text":"things and it's commodity I don't","start":5177.75,"duration":3.21},{"text":"believe that I don't believe modeling is","start":5179.64,"duration":3.12},{"text":"commodity at all I think it's actually","start":5180.96,"duration":3.72},{"text":"really hard to get models to work","start":5182.76,"duration":3.87},{"text":"correctly and it's","start":5184.68,"duration":3.6},{"text":"when you move beyond that toy or","start":5186.63,"duration":3.8},{"text":"benchmark data set to real-world data","start":5188.28,"duration":5.25},{"text":"building something robust and that works","start":5190.43,"duration":6.1},{"text":"at scale is actually really difficult so","start":5193.53,"duration":5.31},{"text":"I'd say that's the second part is","start":5196.53,"duration":5.04},{"text":"actually the hard elbow grease and our","start":5198.84,"duration":4.35},{"text":"research work of getting a working model","start":5201.57,"duration":3.81},{"text":"is usually hard harder than people think","start":5203.19,"duration":6.53},{"text":"and then the last part I would say is","start":5205.38,"duration":12.06},{"text":"actually getting getting buy-in I would","start":5209.72,"duration":10.87},{"text":"say from executives so this is a long","start":5217.44,"duration":5.19},{"text":"journey to getting something out

are","start":69.16,"duration":7.41},{"text":"some of the best classes out there yeah","start":71.08,"duration":6.87},{"text":"I mean I have to say I've actually","start":76.57,"duration":3.06},{"text":"learned a lot from from watching you","start":77.95,"duration":4.77},{"text":"teach and I'm kind of curious like how","start":79.63,"duration":5.13},{"text":"did you even kind of get the idea of","start":82.72,"duration":4.89},{"text":"teaching a class like how did that how","start":84.76,"duration":5.22},{"text":"did that come up this sort of all","start":87.61,"duration":4.32},{"text":"started to happen around two years ago","start":89.98,"duration":6.36},{"text":"and I was working at opening I at the","start":91.93,"duration":6.78},{"text":"time and opening I was kind of going","start":96.34,"duration":4.56},{"text":"through in an interesting transition I","start":98.71,"duration":5.64},{"text":"would say where when I first joined it","start":100.9,"duration":5.07},{"text":"was really like about like a very","start":104.35,"duration":4.47},{"text":"traditional academic lab like it felt","start":105.97,"duration":4.2},{"text":"like the lab that I was at at Berkeley","start":108.82,"duration":6.24},{"text":"except you know more resources and you","start":110.17,"duration":6.6},{"text":"know at some point they figured out that","start":115.06,"duration":4.08},{"text":"like there was a type of work that they","start":116.77,"duration":5.37},{"text":"were really uniquely suited to do that","start":119.14,"duration":4.89},{"text":"you know typical academic lab is not","start":122.14,"duration":4.77},{"text":"well suited you which is these sort of","start":124.03,"duration":6.719},{"text":"larger projects that involve you

would","start":144.379,"duration":4.411},{"text":"you know sort of clearly mark I move","start":146.209,"duration":4.881},{"text":"forward in the state of the field and","start":148.79,"duration":4.559},{"text":"you know so while this was happening you","start":151.09,"duration":4.509},{"text":"know a big part of that change was we","start":153.349,"duration":4.441},{"text":"needed to figure out like how we are","start":155.599,"duration":4.53},{"text":"going to professionalize our process

on","start":161.87,"duration":3.78},{"text":"the robotics team which I was working on","start":164.18,"duration":3.239},{"text":"at the time we were figuring out stuff","start":165.65,"duration":4.41},{"text":"like how do we write good tests for","start":167.419,"duration":4.621},{"text":"machine learning code right so that you","start":170.06,"duration":3.329},{"text":"know lose the ability to train a model","start":172.04,"duration":2.55},{"text":"that you're able to train a

for","start":192.53,"duration":3.989},{"text":"this week and have we met that goal all","start":193.7,"duration":4.709},{"text":"right so yeah we were we were trying to","start":196.519,"duration":4.65},{"text":"sort out all these things and around","start":198.409,"duration":5.101},{"text":"that time I was talking to my

we","start":218.629,"duration":4.01},{"text":"were approaching these things and how","start":221.359,"duration":3.571},{"text":"Peter had seen other companies approach","start":222.639,"duration":5.891},{"text":"these and and how how Sergey had","start":224.93,"duration":5.19},{"text":"approached I'm gonna stuff that great","start":228.53,"duration":3.709},{"text":"scope and we realized that there is this","start":230.12,"duration":6.179},{"text":"this whole like emerging engineering","start":232.239,"duration":6.101},{"text":"discipline I would call it around like","start":236.299,"duration":3.93},{"text":"you know you can you can go online and","start":238.34,"duration":4.079},{"text":"learn the math from the algorithms","start":240.229,"duration":3.93},{"text":"behind machine learning or you can

time","start":250.519,"duration":6.27},{"text":"there was like very little on everything","start":253.79,"duration":4.11},{"text":"else that you need in order to actually","start":256.789,"duration":2.31},{"text":"make this stuff work in the real world","start":257.9,"duration":5.61},{"text":"right so you know not only the things I","start":259.099,"duration":7.401},{"text":"described but also like like how do you","start":263.51,"duration":5.51},{"text":"shoot models how do you choose projects","start":266.5,"duration":5.76},{"text":"how do you you know how do you manage","start":269.02,"duration":5.61},{"text":"teams how do you deploy things into","start":272.26,"duration":3.75},{"text":"production how do you monitor them one","start":274.63,"duration":3.66},{"text":"once they're in production and so we","start":276.01,"duration":4.59},{"text":"realized that like there's you know","start":278.29,"duration":4.05},{"text":"every one that we knew of us was sort of","start":280.6,"duration":3.12},{"text":"reinventing the wheel on all these","start":282.34,"duration":4.98},{"text":"practices and you know the the number of","start":283.72,"duration":4.95},{"text":"people that that are actually good at","start":287.32,"duration":4.23},{"text":"this is like very small and they happen","start":288.67,"duration":5.1},{"text":"to be trapped in like a small handful of","start":291.55,"duration":4.32},{"text":"large technology companies in the Bay","start":293.77,"duration":4.65},{"text":"Area let's say and so we we just thought","start":295.87,"duration":4.52},{"text":"it'd be really good for the field if we","start":298.42,"duration":3.84},{"text":"wrote down everything that we knew about","start":300.39,"duration":3.67},{"text":"the stuff and everything that our","start":302.26,"duration":3.84},{"text":"friends knew about it and so that was","start":304.06,"duration":3.54},{"text":"kind of the genesis of the full stack","start":306.1,"duration":3.9},{"text":"deep learning class but I guess what's","start":307.6,"duration":3.9},{"text":"amazing what I don't really thought","start":310.0,"duration":3.78},{"text":"about it this way but you know I feel","start":311.5,"duration":5.37},{"text":"like I've spent you know my career and","start":313.78,"duration":5.31},{"text":"I'm a little older than you you know","start":316.87,"duration":4.71},{"text":"kind of like studying you know making","start":319.09,"duration":4.32},{"text":"you know machine learning models work in","start":321.58,"duration":4.589},{"text":"the real world but like watching your","start":323.41,"duration":4.62},{"text":"class I'm like learning a ton and I'm","start":326.169,"duration":3.511},{"text":"seeing you know you as like the the","start":328.03,"duration":5.46},{"text":"expert how did you how did you get like","start":329.68,"duration":5.73},{"text":"up to speed on this stuff so fast was it","start":333.49,"duration":3.39},{"text":"just through the experience that open AI","start":335.41,"duration":4.23},{"text":"or because your classes are amazingly","start":336.88,"duration":5.97},{"text":"deep yeah it's a good question I mean I","start":339.64,"duration":6.33},{"text":"think I was kind of bad opening I at the","start":342.85,"duration":5.01},{"text":"most most interesting point for this","start":345.97,"duration":3.42},{"text":"right because we're sort of figuring","start":347.86,"duration":3.03},{"text":"this stuff out from first principles and","start":349.39,"duration":3.27},{"text":"so there are tons of conversations","start":350.89,"duration":4.41},{"text":"around like okay like what test should","start":352.66,"duration":3.93},{"text":"we have for machine learning models","start":355.3,"duration":3.84},{"text":"right and it was a really really group","start":356.59,"duration":5.76},{"text":"of people there who who like to you know","start":359.14,"duration":5.76},{"text":"take a problem and and you know break it","start":362.35,"duration":3.81},{"text":"apart and look at it from the ground up","start":364.9,"duration":3.81},{"text":"and so you know I think was able to like","start":366.16,"duration":5.22},{"text":"look at things from you know all the way","start":368.71,"duration":3.87},{"text":"down to the first principles level","start":371.38,"duration":3.96},{"text":"through that and then I think it was but","start":372.58,"duration":4.32},{"text":"it was really just about like trying to","start":375.34,"duration":2.76},{"text":"talk to a lot of the folks that are","start":376.9,"duration":2.76},{"text":"working in the field and see how they","start":378.1,"duration":2.67},{"text":"approach some of these things as well","start":379.66,"duration":4.41},{"text":"like a lot of what we were we the","start":380.77,"duration":4.23},{"text":"content that we put together in that","start":384.07,"duration":3.24},{"text":"class came from you know like 30 or 40","start":385.0,"duration":4.02},{"text":"interviews that we did with with","start":387.31,"duration":2.88},{"text":"practitioners and just trying to","start":389.02,"duration":3.99},{"text":"understand you know we had a good sense","start":390.19,"duration":4.47},{"text":"of like what are the hard things and you","start":393.01,"duration":2.969},{"text":"know what what questions do you need to","start":394.66,"duration":3.509},{"text":"ask if you're you know putting together","start":395.979,"duration":3.721},{"text":"a machine learning like a apply machine","start":398.169,"duration":2.341},{"text":"learning team","start":399.7,"duration":3.0},{"text":"they're just getting kind of a range of","start":400.51,"duration":3.57},{"text":"answers on those was also really helpful","start":402.7,"duration":4.14},{"text":"you know you have kind of a maybe unique","start":404.08,"duration":4.26},{"text":"background and having been like a","start":406.84,"duration":3.72},{"text":"McKinsey consultant yeah for a number of","start":408.34,"duration":4.2},{"text":"years do you think that it informed you","start":410.56,"duration":3.51},{"text":"and all like is that do you think about","start":412.54,"duration":2.79},{"text":"how that might affect the way you","start":414.07,"duration":3.72},{"text":"approach this that I think like the one","start":415.33,"duration":3.78},{"text":"of the things I learned from McKinsey","start":417.79,"duration":3.63},{"text":"was how do you approach like sort of","start":419.11,"duration":6.15},{"text":"really abstract problems like you know","start":421.42,"duration":7.02},{"text":"what should our company do or you know","start":425.26,"duration":5.19},{"text":"what should our org structure look like","start":428.44,"duration":6.12},{"text":"right and how do how to create a so like","start":430.45,"duration":5.67},{"text":"these problems worse like okay where do","start":434.56,"duration":3.03},{"text":"I even start thinking about this problem","start":436.12,"duration":3.78},{"text":"and I think you know the question of","start":437.59,"duration":3.27},{"text":"like how to make machine learning work","start":439.9,"duration":3.33},{"text":"in the real world as this flavor and","start":440.86,"duration":3.63},{"text":"then figuring out how to like break that","start":443.23,"duration":3.06},{"text":"down into parts and like structure your","start":444.49,"duration":3.57},{"text":"thinking around it there's definitely","start":446.29,"duration":4.65},{"text":"like one of the sort of essential things","start":448.06,"duration":4.29},{"text":"that you have to do as a management","start":450.94,"duration":3.87},{"text":"consultant and so I think that yeah they","start":452.35,"duration":3.66},{"text":"definitely inform for the way that I","start":454.81,"duration":3.09},{"text":"looked at this at this problem so is","start":456.01,"duration":5.76},{"text":"there like a piece of your curriculum","start":457.9,"duration":7.38},{"text":"that you feel particularly proud of yeah","start":461.77,"duration":7.02},{"text":"the good thing that um that I sort of","start":465.28,"duration":6.9},{"text":"put the most like emotional energy into","start":468.79,"duration":5.85},{"text":"is the the troubleshooting guide that's","start":472.18,"duration":4.89},{"text":"that's actually my favorite yeah cuz","start":474.64,"duration":4.17},{"text":"that was it that was the piece where I","start":477.07,"duration":4.47},{"text":"just felt like I was ready for my myself","start":478.81,"duration":4.44},{"text":"a few years ago more than anything else","start":481.54,"duration":3.8},{"text":"right because I was I was just trying to","start":483.25,"duration":5.73},{"text":"to like answer the you know to I was","start":485.34,"duration":4.81},{"text":"like my perspective when I was writing","start":488.98,"duration":3.15},{"text":"that was like okay what how could I have","start":490.15,"duration":5.55},{"text":"saved myself like months of time if I","start":492.13,"duration":5.01},{"text":"you know gone and started over in this","start":495.7,"duration":3.54},{"text":"field so well so I have to say you know","start":497.14,"duration":4.59},{"text":"I I got a chance to you know to work for","start":499.24,"duration":5.97},{"text":"you briefly maybe I'm love to do you","start":501.73,"duration":5.46},{"text":"have and I think like one my big","start":505.21,"duration":4.41},{"text":"takeaway from you that I always like","start":507.19,"duration":4.979},{"text":"kind of hear in my head is is you're","start":509.62,"duration":4.59},{"text":"like you know you're like should I slow","start":512.169,"duration":3.981},{"text":"down and change one thing at a time and","start":514.21,"duration":4.08},{"text":"I I mean I feel like that actually","start":516.15,"duration":3.76},{"text":"applies to more than you know machine","start":518.29,"duration":5.16},{"text":"learning honestly but but boy does it","start":519.91,"duration":5.25},{"text":"apply it to machine learning like oh my","start":523.45,"duration":4.77},{"text":"god yeah it's um it's so central in","start":525.16,"duration":4.83},{"text":"machine learning right because it's like","start":528.22,"duration":3.54},{"text":"fundamentally I think the thing that","start":529.99,"duration":3.12},{"text":"makes machine learning so hard is that","start":531.76,"duration":2.27},{"text":"like","start":533.11,"duration":2.85},{"text":"you know when you're when you're writing","start":534.03,"duration":3.63},{"text":"software like when you're writing code","start":535.96,"duration":4.38},{"text":"you know we have this like pretty pretty","start":537.66,"duration":5.44},{"text":"mature ecosystem where like if you if","start":540.34,"duration":5.22},{"text":"you make a mistake then you know usually","start":543.1,"duration":4.11},{"text":"the system that you're that you're","start":545.56,"duration":2.79},{"text":"building or that you're interacting with","start":547.21,"duration":3.12},{"text":"will tell you first of all will tell you","start":548.35,"duration":3.57},{"text":"that you made a mistake and second of","start":550.33,"duration":2.64},{"text":"all it might even give you like a hint","start":551.92,"duration":4.59},{"text":"as to where that mistake is but the the","start":552.97,"duration":4.92},{"text":"insane thing about like actually trying","start":556.51,"duration":2.7},{"text":"to make progress on machine learning","start":557.89,"duration":3.6},{"text":"projects is that most of the time when","start":559.21,"duration":4.26},{"text":"you have a bug the the only thing that","start":561.49,"duration":3.9},{"text":"happens is that the performance of your","start":563.47,"duration":4.62},{"text":"model like doesn't get better as quickly","start":565.39,"duration":5.16},{"text":"as it should right and so there's no way","start":568.09,"duration":3.57},{"text":"of knowing that you've actually made a","start":570.55,"duration":4.29},{"text":"mistake a lot of time unless you happen","start":571.66,"duration":4.38},{"text":"to have like really strong intuition","start":574.84,"duration":2.52},{"text":"about how like what your learning curve","start":576.04,"duration":3.39},{"text":"should look like right and so I feel","start":577.36,"duration":3.45},{"text":"like that's why it's so central to to","start":579.43,"duration":2.91},{"text":"move yeah move slowly","start":580.81,"duration":2.85},{"text":"when you're when you're building new","start":582.34,"duration":3.33},{"text":"machinery models oh that's kind of funny","start":583.66,"duration":6.63},{"text":"because I wonder if like programming you","start":585.67,"duration":6.48},{"text":"know like web applications is the","start":590.29,"duration":3.72},{"text":"outlier here because I think about like","start":592.15,"duration":3.45},{"text":"you know just trying to make an","start":594.01,"duration":3.6},{"text":"advertising campaign work well or like","start":595.6,"duration":4.2},{"text":"trying to get my old motorcycle running","start":597.61,"duration":4.56},{"text":"again it's like you know it's always","start":599.8,"duration":5.22},{"text":"better to change one thing because it's","start":602.17,"duration":4.29},{"text":"it's so hard to tell like what happened","start":605.02,"duration":2.82},{"text":"otherwise but I guess maybe we have just","start":606.46,"duration":4.53},{"text":"better to limit your API is with you","start":607.84,"duration":6.6},{"text":"know programming Python or JavaScript I","start":610.99,"duration":4.68},{"text":"don't know I feel like that's right I","start":614.44,"duration":2.58},{"text":"mean I think I don't know I mean I","start":615.67,"duration":2.49},{"text":"wouldn't consider myself like a","start":617.02,"duration":3.06},{"text":"world-class web developer but when I've","start":618.16,"duration":4.74},{"text":"done it's also been helpful to still","start":620.08,"duration":4.2},{"text":"just change one thing at a time I just","start":622.9,"duration":3.15},{"text":"feel like it's just good advice for all","start":624.28,"duration":4.17},{"text":"situations yeah it might be any time","start":626.05,"duration":3.99},{"text":"you're building anything I feel like as","start":628.45,"duration":3.18},{"text":"you get better at something you can you","start":630.04,"duration":3.09},{"text":"can like increase the you know the","start":631.63,"duration":3.27},{"text":"increment of what you can change at a","start":633.13,"duration":3.84},{"text":"time right like like if I'm training a","start":634.9,"duration":4.14},{"text":"you know like a image classifier or","start":636.97,"duration":3.87},{"text":"something right like I can pretty much","start":639.04,"duration":4.41},{"text":"just start with a you know with a like","start":640.84,"duration":5.55},{"text":"more really good newer architecture or","start":643.45,"duration":3.96},{"text":"like a resonate or something like that","start":646.39,"duration":2.67},{"text":"just cuz I've you know done that enough","start":647.41,"duration":4.05},{"text":"times that I kind of know what what I","start":649.06,"duration":3.99},{"text":"can expect the result will look like if","start":651.46,"duration":3.78},{"text":"it works and what common things that go","start":653.05,"duration":5.07},{"text":"wrong are and so you know yeah I feel","start":655.24,"duration":4.44},{"text":"like I can skip a couple of steps but","start":658.12,"duration":3.54},{"text":"you know when I'm you know writing","start":659.68,"duration":4.2},{"text":"kubernetes code right like something I'm","start":661.66,"duration":4.65},{"text":"very like very much not good at I

be","start":672.399,"duration":3.3},{"text":"interested yeah you know the core","start":673.69,"duration":3.69},{"text":"concept is what we've been talking about","start":675.699,"duration":4.14},{"text":"right which is to start simple and then","start":677.38,"duration":4.47},{"text":"layer on complexity one step at a time","start":679.839,"duration":3.87},{"text":"right and so the first question you","start":681.85,"duration":3.929},{"text":"might have is what does it mean to start","start":683.709,"duration":5.94},{"text":"simple right um I think that like one of","start":685.779,"duration":5.041},{"text":"the things I've noticed with people that","start":689.649,"duration":2.761},{"text":"are getting into the field is that you","start":690.82,"duration":4.29},{"text":"know there's a tendency to it all this","start":692.41,"duration":4.169},{"text":"excitement about around like neural","start":695.11,"duration":4.44},{"text":"network architectures and you know the","start":696.579,"duration":5.76},{"text":"latest and greatest you know state of","start":699.55,"duration":6.69},{"text":"the art model on imagenet and you know","start":702.339,"duration":5.19},{"text":"and so I think people like tend to","start":706.24,"duration":3.42},{"text":"overthink the question of architecture","start":707.529,"duration":5.49},{"text":"selection and you know and selection of","start":709.66,"duration":4.47},{"text":"all the other pieces around that right","start":713.019,"duration":2.25},{"text":"like though what optimized are you","start":714.13,"duration":2.699},{"text":"choose and things like that but in","start":715.269,"duration":2.671},{"text":"reality you know I think what are we","start":716.829,"duration":2.37},{"text":"starting out on a new project the goal","start":717.94,"duration":3.36},{"text":"is to just to choose a reasonable","start":719.199,"duration":6.0},{"text":"default and and start there even if it's","start":721.3,"duration":4.62},{"text":"not state-of-the-art","start":725.199,"duration":1.861},{"text":"and then like once you've convinced","start":725.92,"duration":2.76},{"text":"yourself that everything around that is","start":727.06,"duration":3.779},{"text":"working right so your data loading code","start":728.68,"duration":5.339},{"text":"and your training code and all that","start":730.839,"duration":5.281},{"text":"stuff then you can like gradually move","start":734.019,"duration":3.031},{"text":"closer to a state of the

working","start":738.73,"duration":6.21},{"text":"yeah it's a hard question I think that","start":741.66,"duration":5.71},{"text":"like there's there's some tricks that","start":744.94,"duration":4.86},{"text":"you can use right so the first thing","start":747.37,"duration":4.079},{"text":"that I the first thing I recommend","start":749.8,"duration":4.289},{"text":"people do when you're training in a like","start":751.449,"duration":3.87},{"text":"would say like a new neural net for the","start":754.089,"duration":3.541},{"text":"first time is just make sure that you","start":755.319,"duration":4.621},{"text":"can you know first I mean first of all I","start":757.63,"duration":4.11},{"text":"just get the thing to run right like","start":759.94,"duration":3.389},{"text":"literally just like I'll put something","start":761.74,"duration":4.2},{"text":"just output anything right which is not","start":763.329,"duration":5.19},{"text":"always like as easy as it should be like","start":765.94,"duration":5.19},{"text":"let's say that you've done that then the","start":768.519,"duration":4.021},{"text":"next thing that you I think usually you","start":771.13,"duration":3.84},{"text":"want to do is try to like over fit a","start":772.54,"duration":4.14},{"text":"really small amount of data right so","start":774.97,"duration":4.89},{"text":"like a single batch of data and you know","start":776.68,"duration":4.83},{"text":"it seems really simple and a lot of","start":779.86,"duration":3.06},{"text":"people skip over that step because of","start":781.51,"duration":4.11},{"text":"that and you know 80% of the time it's","start":782.92,"duration":4.89},{"text":"not really necessary but 20% of the time","start":785.62,"duration":4.05},{"text":"you can catch them like pretty nasty","start":787.81,"duration":5.49},{"text":"bugs early on so like I you know I often","start":789.67,"duration":6.99},{"text":"recommend this citing you and I think","start":793.3,"duration":5.279},{"text":"I've I'm sure that this is not obvious","start":796.66,"duration":3.869},{"text":"to most people like why do you","start":798.579,"duration":6.271},{"text":"to overfit a small amount of data so it","start":800.529,"duration":6.87},{"text":"any reasonable like model architecture","start":804.85,"duration":6.81},{"text":"and optimizer and training loop and data","start":807.399,"duration":6.42},{"text":"type you know you should be able to get","start":811.66,"duration":4.02},{"text":"like you're lost down to zero on a","start":813.819,"duration":3.421},{"text":"single batch of data right","start":815.68,"duration":3.209},{"text":"you have enough parameters that the the","start":817.24,"duration":3.539},{"text":"neural net should be old you should","start":818.889,"duration":4.081},{"text":"memorize the data and so you know","start":820.779,"duration":4.831},{"text":"basically like it can't do that then you","start":822.97,"duration":3.51},{"text":"know that you must have like a pretty","start":825.61,"duration":2.76},{"text":"bad bug in in one of those things like","start":826.48,"duration":4.74},{"text":"what kind of bug for example like you","start":828.37,"duration":4.769},{"text":"flip the sign on your loss function","start":831.22,"duration":4.049},{"text":"right and and like your loss actually","start":833.139,"duration":5.01},{"text":"goes up rather than going down or you","start":835.269,"duration":4.651},{"text":"know like another one I see all the time","start":838.149,"duration":4.44},{"text":"is you know it in like a lot of these","start":839.92,"duration":4.219},{"text":"neural network libraries you have to","start":842.589,"duration":4.531},{"text":"input the like the inputs to the loss","start":844.139,"duration":5.68},{"text":"function is you know maybe it's like the","start":847.12,"duration":3.87},{"text":"low jets right so it's like something","start":849.819,"duration":3.63},{"text":"unnormalized but you know maybe you took","start":850.99,"duration":5.399},{"text":"the softmax of that first and so it's","start":853.449,"duration":4.62},{"text":"like it's things like that right where","start":856.389,"duration":4.351},{"text":"it's you know it's just like you wrote","start":858.069,"duration":5.24},{"text":"you wrote the code the wrong way and","start":860.74,"duration":4.62},{"text":"this is just like a quick sense check","start":863.309,"duration":5.291},{"text":"for figuring out like is the code that","start":865.36,"duration":6.69},{"text":"you're running reasonable okay sorry I","start":868.6,"duration":4.979},{"text":"cut you off then then what do you do and","start":872.05,"duration":4.829},{"text":"when you can over fit one tiny subset of","start":873.579,"duration":5.461},{"text":"your data yeah so what you can over fit","start":876.879,"duration":4.471},{"text":"a tiny subset of your data then like I","start":879.04,"duration":4.95},{"text":"would say like the you know one way to","start":881.35,"duration":5.7},{"text":"think about the process of of making","start":883.99,"duration":4.349},{"text":"your neural net better and better over","start":887.05,"duration":3.57},{"text":"time is there's like an outer loop and","start":888.339,"duration":4.92},{"text":"then there's an inner loop right and so","start":890.62,"duration":6.87},{"text":"the outer loop is you know is basically","start":893.259,"duration":6.06},{"text":"like you're you're generally trying to","start":897.49,"duration":3.959},{"text":"do one or two things you're you're","start":899.319,"duration":6.0},{"text":"either trying to like reduce the amount","start":901.449,"duration":5.88},{"text":"of underfitting that your neural net has","start":905.319,"duration":3.99},{"text":"or reduce the amount of overfitting that","start":907.329,"duration":6.391},{"text":"the neural net has and so I'm like you","start":909.309,"duration":6.45},{"text":"know there's there's a lot of strategies","start":913.72,"duration":4.469},{"text":"for doing both those things but the best","start":915.759,"duration":5.67},{"text":"strategy for for reducing underfitting","start":918.189,"duration":5.19},{"text":"is to make your model bigger and for","start":921.429,"duration":3.33},{"text":"reducing overfitting needs to add more","start":923.379,"duration":2.88},{"text":"data and so if you think about what we","start":924.759,"duration":3.06},{"text":"just did with overfitting a single","start":926.259,"duration":4.89},{"text":"bachelor data or with you know","start":927.819,"duration":5.01},{"text":"yeah like driving loss down to zero on a","start":931.149,"duration":3.091},{"text":"single batch of data we're basically","start":932.829,"duration":2.101},{"text":"saying like","start":934.24,"duration":2.219},{"text":"let's take the smallest possible data","start":934.93,"duration":3.719},{"text":"set and let's overfit it right and so","start":936.459,"duration":4.23},{"text":"now the next like question in your","start":938.649,"duration":4.98},{"text":"decision tree should be like alright now","start":940.689,"duration":5.88},{"text":"we know that we were overfitting because","start":943.629,"duration":4.83},{"text":"we can drive loss down to zero so the","start":946.569,"duration":3.27},{"text":"next thing that we should do is reduce","start":948.459,"duration":2.85},{"text":"overfitting and the simplest way to do","start":949.839,"duration":4.56},{"text":"that is to add data but you want to do","start":951.309,"duration":5.07},{"text":"this gradually right so typically what I","start":954.399,"duration":4.11},{"text":"would do next is I would move from a","start":956.379,"duration":3.99},{"text":"single batch of data to like a you know","start":958.509,"duration":3.57},{"text":"smaller or more simplified version of","start":960.369,"duration":3.75},{"text":"the data set that I was working with so","start":962.079,"duration":3.69},{"text":"maybe it's like I don't know you just","start":964.119,"duration":3.301},{"text":"take maybe of a million images but you","start":965.769,"duration":3.81},{"text":"just take you know a thousand or 10,000","start":967.42,"duration":4.8},{"text":"of them let start out with maybe you","start":969.579,"duration":4.43},{"text":"make a like a synthetic sort of toy","start":972.22,"duration":3.419},{"text":"version of the problem that you're","start":974.009,"duration":3.07},{"text":"working with you know if you're doing","start":975.639,"duration":4.38},{"text":"reinforcement learning maybe you work","start":977.079,"duration":5.13},{"text":"with like a one of the standard sort of","start":980.019,"duration":5.281},{"text":"simple benchmark problems like you know","start":982.209,"duration":5.451},{"text":"like carpol or or something like that","start":985.3,"duration":5.069},{"text":"and so it's like you just make you just","start":987.66,"duration":4.179},{"text":"make the problem like one step more","start":990.369,"duration":3.051},{"text":"difficult than a single batch or do I","start":991.839,"duration":2.761},{"text":"see","start":993.42,"duration":4.419},{"text":"so you add one sort of piece of","start":994.6,"duration":5.25},{"text":"complexity yeah that's the way I think","start":997.839,"duration":4.05},{"text":"about it is it's like God and why","start":999.85,"duration":4.469},{"text":"wouldn't you just add all the data that","start":1001.889,"duration":4.5},{"text":"you have cuz because like your","start":1004.319,"duration":3.69},{"text":"conclusions I imagine that could change","start":1006.389,"duration":3.151},{"text":"at different scales of data for example","start":1008.009,"duration":4.83},{"text":"yeah definitely um I think there's","start":1009.54,"duration":7.279},{"text":"there's two core reasons right so one is","start":1012.839,"duration":8.761},{"text":"you a lot of times I guess like maybe","start":1016.819,"duration":7.14},{"text":"the simplest one want to explain is that","start":1021.6,"duration":4.679},{"text":"it just reduces your iteration time","start":1023.959,"duration":3.88},{"text":"right so if you're working with a","start":1026.279,"duration":2.971},{"text":"smaller data set or a simpler data set","start":1027.839,"duration":2.58},{"text":"then typically your model will change","start":1029.25,"duration":3.329},{"text":"faster it'll be cheaper and so you can","start":1030.419,"duration":3.451},{"text":"just try out more things more quickly","start":1032.579,"duration":4.71},{"text":"which is super key but I think like the","start":1033.87,"duration":4.98},{"text":"deeper and more interesting reason is","start":1037.289,"duration":5.581},{"text":"that you know if you like a lot of times","start":1038.85,"duration":6.349},{"text":"in machine learning you're working you","start":1042.87,"duration":5.429},{"text":"have like some degree of confidence that","start":1045.199,"duration":5.291},{"text":"you're that this model should actually","start":1048.299,"duration":3.87},{"text":"be able to solve the task that you're","start":1050.49,"duration":4.14},{"text":"working on but a lot of times you don't","start":1052.169,"duration":3.63},{"text":"actually know that for a fact","start":1054.63,"duration":2.669},{"text":"right like maybe you're doing image","start":1055.799,"duration":3.181},{"text":"classification but you're not doing it","start":1057.299,"duration":3.451},{"text":"on image net you're doing it on some","start":1058.98,"duration":4.59},{"text":"other data set like maybe a your you're","start":1060.75,"duration":4.7},{"text":"classifying like whether something is","start":1063.57,"duration":3.76},{"text":"you know whether a person is where","start":1065.45,"duration":4.16},{"text":"in an image or not and so it's like","start":1067.33,"duration":3.93},{"text":"intuitively you feel like it should be","start":1069.61,"duration":3.27},{"text":"possible to solve this with a neural net","start":1071.26,"duration":3.33},{"text":"but you don't actually know that for","start":1072.88,"duration":2.669},{"text":"sure","start":1074.59,"duration":3.679},{"text":"and so you wanna you want to try to","start":1075.549,"duration":5.341},{"text":"isolate this the sources of error in","start":1078.269,"duration":4.481},{"text":"your problem right and so if one of the","start":1080.89,"duration":3.24},{"text":"possible sources of error is that like","start":1082.75,"duration":4.95},{"text":"this data set is just too hard then it","start":1084.13,"duration":5.22},{"text":"makes sense to start with a version of","start":1087.7,"duration":2.729},{"text":"the data set that you know that your","start":1089.35,"duration":3.48},{"text":"model should be able to do well on and","start":1090.429,"duration":4.081},{"text":"so smaller data sets less complex data","start":1092.83,"duration":4.349},{"text":"sets allotted you got but wouldn't a","start":1094.51,"duration":5.21},{"text":"smaller data set make the problem harder","start":1097.179,"duration":5.46},{"text":"yeah what sounds like if say I'm trying","start":1099.72,"duration":4.75},{"text":"to classify if someone has a hat on or","start":1102.639,"duration":5.52},{"text":"not if if I have less training data it","start":1104.47,"duration":6.03},{"text":"might I would expect my accuracy to be","start":1108.159,"duration":7.201},{"text":"lower right hmm yeah that's definitely","start":1110.5,"duration":9.269},{"text":"true I think that like so I guess this","start":1115.36,"duration":5.61},{"text":"comes back to like the overall process","start":1119.769,"duration":2.461},{"text":"that we're trying to follow right so","start":1120.97,"duration":3.6},{"text":"it's like I think of it as iterating","start":1122.23,"duration":4.14},{"text":"between you know illuminating","start":1124.57,"duration":4.199},{"text":"underfitting and eliminating overfitting","start":1126.37,"duration":7.11},{"text":"and so the you know the like if you're","start":1128.769,"duration":6.091},{"text":"in a situation where your model is like","start":1133.48,"duration":2.49},{"text":"doing perfectly well on your training","start":1134.86,"duration":4.26},{"text":"set then it makes sense to increase the","start":1135.97,"duration":5.309},{"text":"complexity of your training set if","start":1139.12,"duration":4.14},{"text":"you're in a situation where your model","start":1141.279,"duration":3.961},{"text":"can't do well on the training set right","start":1143.26,"duration":4.139},{"text":"then then you need to figure out like","start":1145.24,"duration":3.63},{"text":"you know is it is it that my training","start":1147.399,"duration":3.03},{"text":"data is too hard is it that I need a","start":1148.87,"duration":3.299},{"text":"bigger model is it that I need at","start":1150.429,"duration":3.031},{"text":"different architectures that I need","start":1152.169,"duration":2.521},{"text":"different optimizer different hyper","start":1153.46,"duration":4.709},{"text":"parameters right and so like working","start":1154.69,"duration":6.089},{"text":"with a data set where you know that's","start":1158.169,"duration":4.62},{"text":"easier to get to that point of your of","start":1160.779,"duration":5.461},{"text":"your model overfitting just like reduces","start":1162.789,"duration":4.681},{"text":"the the number of things that could be","start":1166.24,"duration":4.35},{"text":"wrong with your model interesting are","start":1167.47,"duration":5.64},{"text":"there more steps to this I mean that's","start":1170.59,"duration":3.78},{"text":"that's the high level flow right it's","start":1173.11,"duration":4.98},{"text":"like um you know solve your problem make","start":1174.37,"duration":5.73},{"text":"it harder solve your problems make it","start":1178.09,"duration":3.9},{"text":"harder and then there's like there's","start":1180.1,"duration":3.9},{"text":"details about how to make easier those","start":1181.99,"duration":6.12},{"text":"things work well right like what are the","start":1184.0,"duration":6.269},{"text":"steps you should actually try you know","start":1188.11,"duration":4.23},{"text":"when you're under fitting and you need","start":1190.269,"duration":3.78},{"text":"to you need to like make your model more","start":1192.34,"duration":7.53},{"text":"expressive and yeah but I think that","start":1194.049,"duration":7.11},{"text":"like that's that's sort of like the","start":1199.87,"duration":3.989},{"text":"you overall picture will have to put a","start":1201.159,"duration":5.281},{"text":"link to this and some people can find it","start":1203.859,"duration":4.26},{"text":"do you plan to teach more of these","start":1206.44,"duration":3.989},{"text":"classes I think so yeah","start":1208.119,"duration":6.961},{"text":"we

maybe","start":1217.389,"duration":5.551},{"text":"adverts maybe virtual it would be a yeah","start":1220.179,"duration":5.041},{"text":"maybe a virtual one um that could be

like","start":1677.64,"duration":4.87},{"text":"okay what are like the enabling pieces","start":1680.679,"duration":3.151},{"text":"that we need in order to actually for","start":1682.51,"duration":2.7},{"text":"this story to come true right for a","start":1683.83,"duration":3.39},{"text":"story that like deep deep

the","start":1688.24,"duration":7.17},{"text":"the piece that was kind of missing for","start":1692.64,"duration":5.11},{"text":"that story is that you know deep","start":1695.41,"duration":3.93},{"text":"reinforcement learning is very powerful","start":1697.75,"duration":4.14},{"text":"but it's very data inefficient like

and","start":1715.419,"duration":6.541},{"text":"so like for me kind of looking into this","start":1718.36,"duration":4.98},{"text":"field from the outside that was sort of","start":1721.96,"duration":3.57},{"text":"the big question mark right is like is","start":1723.34,"duration":4.65},{"text":"there any way for us to get around this","start":1725.53,"duration":4.08},{"text":"data and efficiency problem for robots","start":1727.99,"duration":3.15},{"text":"right because like going out

it's","start":1738.95,"duration":5.609},{"text":"definitely possible but it's uh you know","start":1742.13,"duration":4.799},{"text":"do you really want to have to have like","start":1744.559,"duration":4.291},{"text":"a you know dozens of robot arms running","start":1746.929,"duration":3.75},{"text":"24\/7 for weeks every time you want to","start":1748.85,"duration":3.6},{"text":"learn new behavior sure yeah","start":1750.679,"duration":5.13},{"text":"and so like so you know the coming back","start":1752.45,"duration":5.52},{"text":"to this paper right like the the","start":1755.809,"duration":4.141},{"text":"question that I was I got interested in","start":1757.97,"duration":4.289},{"text":"was is there any way to learn behaviors","start":1759.95,"duration":5.729},{"text":"in a physics simulator right where you","start":1762.259,"duration":4.65},{"text":"actually have access to hundreds and","start":1765.679,"duration":3.151},{"text":"millions of labeled examples but then","start":1766.909,"duration":4.411},{"text":"somehow make that work when the robot is","start":1768.83,"duration":4.199},{"text":"put out into the real world I was kind","start":1771.32,"duration":4.68},{"text":"of working on this you know back when I","start":1773.029,"duration":6.331},{"text":"was an intern at open e I and we had","start":1776.0,"duration":5.399},{"text":"like a really concrete problem that we","start":1779.36,"duration":4.019},{"text":"were trying to solve which is you know","start":1781.399,"duration":4.23},{"text":"we were we were trying to set up a robot","start":1783.379,"duration":6.121},{"text":"to like make a stack of blocks so just","start":1785.629,"duration":5.13},{"text":"like pick up blocks from the table and","start":1789.5,"duration":2.669},{"text":"then you know stack them on top of each","start":1790.759,"duration":5.071},{"text":"other and you know like the the policy","start":1792.169,"duration":5.48},{"text":"like the robot behavior was trained","start":1795.83,"duration":3.689},{"text":"assuming that you actually know where","start":1797.649,"duration":3.73},{"text":"the blocks are in the real world and so","start":1799.519,"duration":2.79},{"text":"then we needed to like go back and","start":1801.379,"duration":2.52},{"text":"backfill like how do we actually find","start":1802.309,"duration":3.96},{"text":"out how do how do we estimate the","start":1803.899,"duration":3.721},{"text":"position of each of these blocks in the","start":1806.269,"duration":4.321},{"text":"real world seems it's something that","start":1807.62,"duration":4.35},{"text":"seems like a really easy problem but","start":1810.59,"duration":2.939},{"text":"actually when you think about how do you","start":1811.97,"duration":3.24},{"text":"make this really work it's more","start":1813.529,"duration":4.02},{"text":"complicated than you'd expect honestly","start":1815.21,"duration":4.349},{"text":"it's it's so counterintuitive I think","start":1817.549,"duration":3.48},{"text":"you know even for me and probably for","start":1819.559,"duration":3.811},{"text":"most people right that's hard you know I","start":1821.029,"duration":4.591},{"text":"mean just it's just amazing but that's","start":1823.37,"duration":5.159},{"text":"hard yeah and I think you know it's not","start":1825.62,"duration":4.32},{"text":"that it's not like the hardest research","start":1828.529,"duration":2.88},{"text":"problem in the world but it's it's like","start":1829.94,"duration":3.209},{"text":"when you actually sit down and try to go","start":1831.409,"duration":3.421},{"text":"and make it work really well it's um","start":1833.149,"duration":5.101},{"text":"it's very tricky Joan and so we were","start":1834.83,"duration":6.42},{"text":"playing around with you know these","start":1838.25,"duration":5.07},{"text":"different like tag you know Haruko tags","start":1841.25,"duration":5.519},{"text":"and like methods like that where you","start":1843.32,"duration":5.219},{"text":"know the you understand the like the","start":1846.769,"duration":4.051},{"text":"intrinsics of the camera and then you","start":1848.539,"duration":4.11},{"text":"know it reads this like this tag off of","start":1850.82,"duration":3.75},{"text":"an object and then it can you know infer","start":1852.649,"duration":3.601},{"text":"the position of the object you know","start":1854.57,"duration":5.13},{"text":"given the position of the camera and we","start":1856.25,"duration":4.32},{"text":"just found those things to be like","start":1859.7,"duration":3.689},{"text":"really fragile and not honestly

like","start":1869.66,"duration":4.86},{"text":"you know we were mostly deep learning","start":1872.51,"duration":3.299},{"text":"folks right and so the obvious question","start":1874.52,"duration":2.519},{"text":"is like why don't you just train a","start":1875.809,"duration":4.98},{"text":"neural net to do this you know just","start":1877.039,"duration":5.551},{"text":"train a neural net to take an image of a","start":1880.789,"duration":3.451},{"text":"table and then say like okay here the","start":1882.59,"duration":3.81},{"text":"position of all the of all the cubes on","start":1884.24,"duration":5.179},{"text":"the table but the problem is that

you","start":1892.13,"duration":4.26},{"text":"almost need to solve the problem you","start":1893.57,"duration":3.93},{"text":"almost need to know you need to

that","start":1899.33,"duration":3.12},{"text":"you use to train the neuron that right","start":1901.01,"duration":2.52},{"text":"so it's a bit of a chicken and

like","start":1980.63,"duration":3.96},{"text":"um you know they look like scenes from","start":1982.64,"duration":4.05},{"text":"like a from like an anime disco or","start":1984.59,"duration":5.28},{"text":"something but what happens is that","start":1986.69,"duration":7.53},{"text":"actually the the neural net you know

basically","start":2040.15,"duration":5.01},{"text":"show the neural not like every every","start":2042.61,"duration":5.22},{"text":"color and every shadow that you know it","start":2045.16,"duration":5.519},{"text":"could even possibly see and so then it","start":2047.83,"duration":5.01},{"text":"it like in order to solve the task it","start":2050.679,"duration":4.081},{"text":"needs to learn like okay that's you know","start":2052.84,"duration":3.36},{"text":"colors the shadows are not important","start":2054.76,"duration":3.81},{"text":"right what's important is like the","start":2056.2,"duration":5.13},{"text":"position of this cube looking thing on","start":2058.57,"duration":6.12},{"text":"the table and so it's not overfitting to","start":2061.33,"duration":4.74},{"text":"like all of all the details that are","start":2064.69,"duration":3.9},{"text":"unimportant and it's actually and so","start":2066.07,"duration":5.52},{"text":"then you know the details that it is","start":2068.59,"duration":4.53},{"text":"looking at are the ones hopefully that","start":2071.59,"duration":3.45},{"text":"will transfer over when it's deployed

a","start":2082.21,"duration":5.85},{"text":"pretty wide range of sort of computer","start":2086.05,"duration":4.349},{"text":"vision and robotics tasks at this

really","start":2104.16,"duration":6.22},{"text":"hard task because fish are very shiny","start":2108.43,"duration":5.61},{"text":"and slippery right and like and in","start":2110.38,"duration":6.63},{"text":"general like most like object detection","start":2114.04,"duration":4.41},{"text":"methods and like computer vision

things","start":2120.04,"duration":4.59},{"text":"like that so that's my favorite like","start":2121.21,"duration":5.43},{"text":"random application but you know it's","start":2124.63,"duration":4.62},{"text":"it's been applied to you know folding","start":2126.64,"duration":6.21},{"text":"cloth it's been applied to you

the most the furthest this","start":2135.34,"duration":5.04},{"text":"idea has been pushed is I was that","start":2138.19,"duration":5.93},{"text":"opening I in you know when they they use","start":2140.38,"duration":6.75},{"text":"they use the second to have a robe on","start":2144.12,"duration":6.67},{"text":"hand that solves a Rubik's Cube make you","start":2147.13,"duration":4.89},{"text":"say a little bit about why that was such","start":2150.79,"duration":3.21},{"text":"an impressive task or I guess there was","start":2152.02,"duration":4.23},{"text":"some maybe there was some controversy","start":2154.0,"duration":4.23},{"text":"right about like is this sort of a","start":2156.25,"duration":5.1},{"text":"Gaston or is this like a real deep task","start":2158.23,"duration":6.81},{"text":"I guess where do you land on that so","start":2161.35,"duration":6.06},{"text":"maybe maybe the the different sides of","start":2165.04,"duration":5.79},{"text":"this issue would be like on one hand you","start":2167.41,"duration":5.37},{"text":"know I think if you look at if you look","start":2170.83,"duration":4.65},{"text":"at those types of things that you know","start":2172.78,"duration":4.05},{"text":"the types of tasks that people have been","start":2175.48,"duration":3.77},{"text":"able to solve with robots over the years","start":2176.83,"duration":6.98},{"text":"the this task of this sort right like","start":2179.25,"duration":8.05},{"text":"using a high dimensional dexterous robot","start":2183.81,"duration":6.91},{"text":"to manipulate a complicated object are","start":2187.3,"duration":5.61},{"text":"very sort of feud far between in the","start":2190.72,"duration":3.6},{"text":"robotics world and it's kind of","start":2192.91,"duration":3.75},{"text":"generally seen as like you know high","start":2194.32,"duration":4.08},{"text":"dimensional contact range dexterous","start":2196.66,"duration":3.21},{"text":"manipulation that's being like sort of","start":2198.4,"duration":3.44},{"text":"one of the grand challenges of robotics","start":2199.87,"duration":4.17},{"text":"and so I think one point of view on this","start":2201.84,"duration":4.36},{"text":"is that even just something at like a","start":2204.04,"duration":4.2},{"text":"proof-of-concept level to show that it's","start":2206.2,"duration":4.77},{"text":"like possible to even do this once is a","start":2208.24,"duration":6.15},{"text":"big step for the field because you know","start":2210.97,"duration":4.89},{"text":"there's there's very few examples of","start":2214.39,"duration":3.33},{"text":"there are some but there's very few","start":2215.86,"duration":6.02},{"text":"examples of projects that have pushed","start":2217.72,"duration":7.11},{"text":"robot manipulation as far as you know","start":2221.88,"duration":5.86},{"text":"being able to solve a Rubik's Cube I","start":2224.83,"duration":4.23},{"text":"think the other perspective would just","start":2227.74,"duration":2.73},{"text":"be that like you know if you look at the","start":2229.06,"duration":3.38},{"text":"details in the paper the algorithm like","start":2230.47,"duration":3.99},{"text":"actually worth you know something like","start":2232.44,"duration":5.86},{"text":"20% of the time and so you might argue","start":2234.46,"duration":6.93},{"text":"that like you know and it was a pretty","start":2238.3,"duration":4.89},{"text":"big effort to get to to actually make it","start":2241.39,"duration":3.93},{"text":"work for the first time right so you","start":2243.19,"duration":4.53},{"text":"know pretty big team working on for a","start":2245.32,"duration":3.87},{"text":"long time and so you might argue that","start":2247.72,"duration":4.17},{"text":"like yeah obviously if you put you know","start":2249.19,"duration":4.92},{"text":"10 or 12 really brilliant people and","start":2251.89,"duration":5.52},{"text":"have them work on you know one tiny like","start":2254.11,"duration":6.09},{"text":"sliver of a problem for for a long time","start":2257.41,"duration":4.44},{"text":"then obviously they'll be able to make","start":2260.2,"duration":4.5},{"text":"it work once I would say that you know","start":2261.85,"duration":5.6},{"text":"that's not obvious","start":2264.7,"duration":2.75},{"text":"I'm trying to play doubles a statement","start":2267.47,"duration":5.4},{"text":"my advice is that it's important result","start":2270.65,"duration":4.59},{"text":"in robotics and I think that you know","start":2272.87,"duration":4.35},{"text":"but I think like the perspective that","start":2275.24,"duration":3.27},{"text":"you have to that you have to have when","start":2277.22,"duration":3.9},{"text":"you look at this is that um you know is","start":2278.51,"duration":4.92},{"text":"very much a research result right like I","start":2281.12,"duration":4.53},{"text":"think a mistake that people make when","start":2283.43,"duration":3.63},{"text":"looking at results like this I think","start":2285.65,"duration":2.64},{"text":"this is true in a I'm general is that","start":2287.06,"duration":5.34},{"text":"like you will get you know humans or","start":2288.29,"duration":5.76},{"text":"like computers being better than humans","start":2292.4,"duration":4.38},{"text":"at any task and you say like okay this","start":2294.05,"duration":4.71},{"text":"means that like robots are gonna take","start":2296.78,"duration":4.67},{"text":"this job in two years and that's like","start":2298.76,"duration":5.04},{"text":"not like if you look at the details of","start":2301.45,"duration":3.61},{"text":"how hard it was to actually make this","start":2303.8,"duration":2.91},{"text":"work once you know twenty percent of","start":2305.06,"duration":3.15},{"text":"time it's like there's a lot more","start":2306.71,"duration":2.52},{"text":"research that will need to happen in","start":2308.21,"duration":2.76},{"text":"order for this to become a thing that","start":2309.23,"duration":4.38},{"text":"robots can do reliably but I do think","start":2310.97,"duration":4.56},{"text":"there's a lot of value in the proof of","start":2313.61,"duration":4.14},{"text":"concept just to show that like this is","start":2315.53,"duration":4.74},{"text":"you know this is a set of techniques","start":2317.75,"duration":5.96},{"text":"that you know this team was able to push","start":2320.27,"duration":6.3},{"text":"far enough to do this task that is like","start":2323.71,"duration":4.87},{"text":"objectively really difficult for robots","start":2326.57,"duration":4.41},{"text":"to do and then you know over time the","start":2328.58,"duration":3.93},{"text":"field will back feel like I don't","start":2330.98,"duration":3.45},{"text":"actually do that you know a more","start":2332.51,"duration":5.52},{"text":"efficient way I guess I didn't realize","start":2334.43,"duration":4.95},{"text":"it only worked twenty percent of the","start":2338.03,"duration":3.69},{"text":"time this is like twenty percent success","start":2339.38,"duration":4.5},{"text":"rate meeting completely manipulated the","start":2341.72,"duration":7.11},{"text":"cube to be back in the the like correct","start":2343.88,"duration":6.57},{"text":"state is that right yeah I think that","start":2348.83,"duration":6.63},{"text":"like I think the fine print is for a for","start":2350.45,"duration":7.14},{"text":"the like hardest variant of the problem","start":2355.46,"duration":3.9},{"text":"which is like the Cube randomized as","start":2357.59,"duration":4.77},{"text":"much as it can't be the robot was only","start":2359.36,"duration":4.82},{"text":"able to get it back to fully solved","start":2362.36,"duration":4.92},{"text":"twenty percent of the time I think on","start":2364.18,"duration":4.84},{"text":"average it did more than that I think","start":2367.28,"duration":3.57},{"text":"also yeah like maybe one of the other","start":2369.02,"duration":4.11},{"text":"details people took issue with was the","start":2370.85,"duration":4.47},{"text":"fact that there was the machine learning","start":2373.13,"duration":4.26},{"text":"algorithm itself did not you know didn't","start":2375.32,"duration":3.54},{"text":"didn't say like the sequence of actions","start":2377.39,"duration":5.31},{"text":"that you need to solve the cube right it","start":2378.86,"duration":5.4},{"text":"didn't like it wasn't like a neural net","start":2382.7,"duration":3.78},{"text":"was saying you know turn this face and","start":2384.26,"duration":3.51},{"text":"then turn this face and then turn this","start":2386.48,"duration":4.89},{"text":"face the there was like a hard coded","start":2387.77,"duration":5.13},{"text":"solver that was saying the sequence of","start":2391.37,"duration":3.84},{"text":"actions that you take and then the","start":2392.9,"duration":3.84},{"text":"neural net was just saying like okay","start":2395.21,"duration":2.97},{"text":"here's how you move your fingers in","start":2396.74,"duration":3.41},{"text":"order to achieve this action","start":2398.18,"duration":4.05},{"text":"so the point the point is the","start":2400.15,"duration":5.17},{"text":"manipulation so people are mad because","start":2402.23,"duration":7.74},{"text":"it was like a fun demonstration I think","start":2405.32,"duration":8.88},{"text":"you know I think people often take issue","start":2409.97,"duration":5.4},{"text":"with the way that opening eye","start":2414.2,"duration":4.11},{"text":"communicates results like this more so","start":2415.37,"duration":5.46},{"text":"than the results themselves because it","start":2418.31,"duration":5.43},{"text":"seems like they're generating attention","start":2420.83,"duration":5.7},{"text":"is that right I think so yeah yeah I","start":2423.74,"duration":5.55},{"text":"think um there's there's a bit of a","start":2426.53,"duration":5.22},{"text":"tension in the field right now of you","start":2429.29,"duration":8.67},{"text":"know between kind of people who maybe","start":2431.75,"duration":7.95},{"text":"have more traditional academic roots and","start":2437.96,"duration":4.86},{"text":"who think that you know the it's like","start":2439.7,"duration":4.38},{"text":"the quality of the scholarship that's","start":2442.82,"duration":3.63},{"text":"important and like you know whether it's","start":2444.08,"duration":5.49},{"text":"truly novel you know whether the results","start":2446.45,"duration":4.77},{"text":"are like really understandable and","start":2449.57,"duration":5.19},{"text":"reproducible you know on one hand and","start":2451.22,"duration":4.97},{"text":"then on the other hand you know folks","start":2454.76,"duration":4.17},{"text":"you know who typically are more of like","start":2456.19,"duration":6.22},{"text":"a the more Industrial Research Lab type","start":2458.93,"duration":5.76},{"text":"places where I think the viewpoint is","start":2462.41,"duration":6.9},{"text":"more like our goal is to you know our","start":2464.69,"duration":5.94},{"text":"goal so like push the state of the art","start":2469.31,"duration":4.8},{"text":"of the field forward and if we have to","start":2470.63,"duration":5.33},{"text":"do that in a way that's like not totally","start":2474.11,"duration":3.81},{"text":"you know not a hundred percent","start":2475.96,"duration":3.58},{"text":"reproducible just because like maybe the","start":2477.92,"duration":4.08},{"text":"experiment was too expensive and that's","start":2479.54,"duration":4.62},{"text":"okay because we're removing the removing","start":2482.0,"duration":3.63},{"text":"the goalpost sort of like the types of","start":2484.16,"duration":6.21},{"text":"things that a eye is able to do yeah and","start":2485.63,"duration":5.52},{"text":"I think there's like kind of a","start":2490.37,"duration":2.85},{"text":"fundamental tension there that make","start":2491.15,"duration":4.74},{"text":"sense so I guess you've you've left","start":2493.22,"duration":4.8},{"text":"opening eye so what are you what are you","start":2495.89,"duration":4.62},{"text":"working on dad's yeah no it's a

everything","start":2514.88,"duration":5.82},{"text":"and you know like it should be like","start":2516.59,"duration":5.67},{"text":"software where it's like just sort

that's","start":2554.26,"duration":6.93},{"text":"sort of the the route like the","start":2558.13,"duration":4.5},{"text":"fundamental question that I thought

one","start":2568.21,"duration":5.34},{"text":"of them I mean you've clearly like been","start":2571.03,"duration":3.78},{"text":"spending a lot of time thinking about it","start":2573.55,"duration":3.84},{"text":"like what's some of your conclusions","start":2574.81,"duration":4.89},{"text":"like if you if you had to pick like one","start":2577.39,"duration":6.48},{"text":"thing well what would that be I mean","start":2579.7,"duration":5.49},{"text":"this comes back to our

the","start":2593.4,"duration":5.2},{"text":"dirty secrets of machine learning is","start":2596.65,"duration":4.47},{"text":"that turning something that works once","start":2598.6,"duration":5.67},{"text":"or like I don't know works is ninety","start":2601.12,"duration":5.48},{"text":"percent accurate on like one data

actually","start":2616.06,"duration":5.51},{"text":"like start to run your business on","start":2619.93,"duration":4.35},{"text":"that's really hard right and so I think","start":2621.57,"duration":5.68},{"text":"you know I think like figuring out how","start":2624.28,"duration":4.38},{"text":"to answer that question and sort of the","start":2627.25,"duration":3.12},{"text":"is like the big question that the field","start":2628.66,"duration":3.87},{"text":"needs to answer right now yeah I guess","start":2630.37,"duration":5.28},{"text":"it's kind of counterintuitive to see a","start":2632.53,"duration":5.52},{"text":"computer do something 20% of the time","start":2635.65,"duration":4.83},{"text":"like that that feels like a really like","start":2638.05,"duration":4.14},{"text":"I feel like most times if I see a","start":2640.48,"duration":3.57},{"text":"computer do something that I know like","start":2642.19,"duration":3.84},{"text":"ok that's it's gonna do that what","start":2644.05,"duration":4.85},{"text":"percent of the time yeah no definitely","start":2646.03,"duration":4.91},{"text":"yeah for sure I mean I think it's like","start":2648.9,"duration":4.6},{"text":"you know maybe one of the other things","start":2650.94,"duration":3.93},{"text":"that I'd like that I've seen through","start":2653.5,"duration":3.3},{"text":"through full stack deep learning and","start":2654.87,"duration":3.7},{"text":"through like some of the other

like","start":2747.94,"duration":4.38},{"text":"really awesome demos and I've always had","start":2749.56,"duration":5.01},{"text":"this fantasy of like Jane like the","start":2752.32,"duration":5.88},{"text":"opposite like do you like an hour with","start":2754.57,"duration":5.4},{"text":"like execs and make it like really kind","start":2758.2,"duration":3.63},{"text":"of hard and boring and like you know let","start":2759.97,"duration":4.95},{"text":"him like fight with the air for a

like","start":2766.93,"duration":2.97},{"text":"actually get the thing working I think","start":2768.52,"duration":5.28},{"text":"would be a fun like a fun I think it

fast","start":2779.98,"duration":4.11},{"text":"as they were hoping I think that I think","start":2781.48,"duration":4.11},{"text":"that also like one thing that would help","start":2784.09,"duration":5.64},{"text":"a lot is I think the the methodology you","start":2785.59,"duration":5.67},{"text":"know this is like sort of where we tried","start":2789.73,"duration":2.64},{"text":"to do is full stack deep learning but","start":2791.26,"duration":3.15},{"text":"maybe didn't really get all the

I","start":2803.589,"duration":5.52},{"text":"think that like you know if there were","start":2805.779,"duration":6.45},{"text":"like an agile equivalent for building","start":2809.109,"duration":4.23},{"text":"machine learning systems I think that","start":2812.229,"duration":3.24},{"text":"would also go a long way because just","start":2813.339,"duration":3.48},{"text":"really just like the block-and-tackle of","start":2815.469,"duration":2.82},{"text":"like how do you actually make this","start":2816.819,"duration":3.811},{"text":"happen so it doesn't feel as much like","start":2818.289,"duration":4.77},{"text":"magic and like what are those crazy

bit","start":2824.529,"duration":3.99},{"text":"more like um like okay I understand that","start":2825.789,"duration":4.591},{"text":"you know this is the set of meetings","start":2828.519,"duration":3.99},{"text":"that the team is having every week and","start":2830.38,"duration":3.449},{"text":"this is how they're measuring

it","start":1125.26,"duration":11.79},{"text":"was one of got it go well I guess you","start":1127.93,"duration":10.62},{"text":"know one thing I thought it was kind

agree","start":1145.87,"duration":3.66},{"text":"with the importance of it but maybe you","start":1148.33,"duration":2.91},{"text":"could sort of say the thinking behind","start":1149.53,"duration":4.17},{"text":"that yeah so the basic idea and the","start":1151.24,"duration":6.18},{"text":"report is that I developers are sort of","start":1153.7,"duration":5.58},{"text":"making all sorts of systems and you know","start":1157.42,"duration":3.18},{"text":"they want to sell them or they want","start":1159.28,"duration":4.05},{"text":"people to use them and they sort of make","start":1160.6,"duration":4.41},{"text":"various claims about these systems like","start":1163.33,"duration":4.29},{"text":"you know we did bias analysis or we you","start":1165.01,"duration":5.16},{"text":"know they're robust in X Y & Z ways and","start":1167.62,"duration":4.59},{"text":"there's some claims like that that are","start":1170.17,"duration":5.07},{"text":"relatively easy to verify like if

if","start":1176.71,"duration":5.25},{"text":"you have expertise to you know replicate","start":1178.78,"duration":5.94},{"text":"the result reproduce a certain error","start":1181.96,"duration":4.89},{"text":"rate and sort of you know verify that","start":1184.72,"duration":4.17},{"text":"you know these developers are telling","start":1186.85,"duration":3.09},{"text":"the truth but there are other cases","start":1188.89,"duration":3.0},{"text":"where it's not as obvious how to do that","start":1189.94,"duration":3.81},{"text":"for example if it's a very compute","start":1191.89,"duration":3.65},{"text":"intensive system it might be harder

of","start":1211.91,"duration":5.13},{"text":"scrutiny for bugs those are cases where","start":1214.43,"duration":4.5},{"text":"it's harder to you know harder to verify","start":1217.04,"duration":4.38},{"text":"the claims made by AI developers so what","start":1218.93,"duration":3.99},{"text":"we did in this report is try and take a","start":1221.42,"duration":4.11},{"text":"very broad you know sort of 30,000 foot","start":1222.92,"duration":4.17},{"text":"view of like okay what is the

sort","start":1229.61,"duration":4.71},{"text":"of elements of an AI project that can","start":1231.95,"duration":6.09},{"text":"contribute to sort of ones claims to be","start":1234.32,"duration":5.43},{"text":"verified I mean in each of those cases","start":1238.04,"duration":3.42},{"text":"we zoom in to whether the would have","start":1239.75,"duration":3.63},{"text":"this intervention that can be made like","start":1241.46,"duration":3.42},{"text":"in software for example we talked about","start":1243.38,"duration":3.63},{"text":"privacy preserving machine learning and","start":1244.88,"duration":4.53},{"text":"the need for more standardization and","start":1247.01,"duration":4.68},{"text":"open source libraries around there so","start":1249.41,"duration":3.87},{"text":"that it's you know it's produced skill","start":1251.69,"duration":4.05},{"text":"requirement increase like the clarity of","start":1253.28,"duration":4.77},{"text":"how different systems should be

of","start":1312.98,"duration":5.52},{"text":"the I guess one of the the real impetus","start":1314.81,"duration":7.95},{"text":"is for me was the the fact that

I","start":2368.589,"duration":3.45},{"text":"think we'll get there eventually and","start":2370.329,"duration":3.421},{"text":"that language models will continue

I","start":2446.21,"duration":5.609},{"text":"like to do you sort of like continue to","start":2449.839,"duration":3.48},{"text":"like push things forward or you sort of","start":2451.819,"duration":3.091},{"text":"like okay we like made this model like","start":2453.319,"duration":4.921},{"text":"we're we're good with it","start":2454.91,"duration":5.13},{"text":"yeah we're so continuing to push things","start":2458.24,"duration":5.369},{"text":"forward and you know both in terms

we've","start":2465.619,"duration":2.881},{"text":"already built and also trying to push","start":2466.88,"duration":7.439},{"text":"further so here's another question that","start":2468.5,"duration":7.41},{"text":"I always have about open it if you don't","start":2474.319,"duration":3.121},{"text":"mind I'm kind of curious yeah I think so","start":2475.91,"duration":3.959},{"text":"like you know I think it's open it has a","start":2477.44,"duration":4.98},{"text":"what's open admission like like ethical","start":2479.869,"duration":5.011},{"text":"AI something like that right remind me","start":2482.42,"duration":5.82},{"text":"yeah the shorthand version is sort

help","start":2491.15,"duration":7.02},{"text":"everyone so I guess like um it seems","start":2494.299,"duration":6.901},{"text":"like a funny mix of sort of policy and","start":2498.17,"duration":4.379},{"text":"building like do you think it's","start":2501.2,"duration":3.919},{"text":"important that those two things are","start":2502.549,"duration":4.141},{"text":"together like","start":2505.119,"duration":4.091},{"text":"like I would I mean I could imagine like","start":2506.69,"duration":8.58},{"text":"should the people like like I guess how","start":2509.21,"duration":7.08},{"text":"would you argue against this because I","start":2515.27,"duration":2.13},{"text":"think I do think they should go together","start":2516.29,"duration":2.43},{"text":"I'm trying to think like the other the","start":2517.4,"duration":2.699},{"text":"other point of view but it sort of seems","start":2518.72,"duration":5.07},{"text":"like well like does this policy and","start":2520.099,"duration":5.22},{"text":"building really necessarily need to be","start":2523.79,"duration":3.299},{"text":"combined like is it even combined in","start":2525.319,"duration":3.811},{"text":"most cases like you know it sort of","start":2527.089,"duration":5.46},{"text":"feels like the policy makers in general","start":2529.13,"duration":5.4},{"text":"like aren't always engineers right like","start":2532.549,"duration":3.401},{"text":"why why I have a","start":2534.53,"duration":5.23},{"text":"that combines both yeah so I I think you","start":2535.95,"duration":6.66},{"text":"know by default a lot of people who are","start":2539.76,"duration":4.95},{"text":"building powerful technologies are like","start":2542.61,"duration":4.08},{"text":"de facto sort of policy makers and that","start":2544.71,"duration":3.27},{"text":"they're setting you know the defaults","start":2546.69,"duration":3.69},{"text":"and well you know how people think

on","start":2566.19,"duration":7.23},{"text":"the policy policy team various different","start":2567.96,"duration":7.41},{"text":"teams um so it makes sense to like have","start":2573.42,"duration":3.66},{"text":"some specialization but I think you know","start":2575.37,"duration":3.45},{"text":"the the reason why we think it's such a","start":2577.08,"duration":4.77},{"text":"high priority is that we don't see sort","start":2578.82,"duration":5.1},{"text":"of the impact of AI as

okay","start":2799.72,"duration":3.36},{"text":"like we have to figure out how to do","start":2801.67,"duration":3.81},{"text":"this right and you know sort of each","start":2803.08,"duration":3.93},{"text":"case and figure out what the right norms","start":2805.48,"duration":3.36},{"text":"are and sort of you know they see

they're","start":2818.53,"duration":3.15},{"text":"like hardcore like let's make sure that","start":2820.0,"duration":3.39},{"text":"we're not causing a harm so I may be","start":2821.68,"duration":3.54},{"text":"like Hippocratic oh it's the end of the","start":2823.39,"duration":3.78},{"text":"spectrum like first do no harm and like","start":2825.22,"duration":4.2},{"text":"take stuff like buy a super Spears and","start":2827.17,"duration":4.11},{"text":"there's another you know there are also","start":2829.42,"duration":4.23},{"text":"lots of people who are you know building","start":2831.28,"duration":4.53},{"text":"systems that you know are sort of","start":2833.65,"duration":3.75},{"text":"focused on getting products to market","start":2835.81,"duration":3.24},{"text":"and they're focused on sort of releasing","start":2837.4,"duration":4.38},{"text":"systems they can inform research and and","start":2839.05,"duration":4.77},{"text":"in the case of gt2 we saw like some of","start":2841.78,"duration":3.27},{"text":"the tension between these perspectives","start":2843.82,"duration":3.81},{"text":"of like you know there was a potentially","start":2845.05,"duration":5.069},{"text":"attention between avoiding causing harm","start":2847.63,"duration":4.41},{"text":"on the one hand and enabling people

and","start":2854.41,"duration":4.77},{"text":"so you could maybe say like Hippocratic","start":2857.17,"duration":4.83},{"text":"you know end of the spectrum and they","start":2859.18,"duration":4.47},{"text":"like move fast and break things end of","start":2862.0,"duration":2.76},{"text":"the spectrum I think there's like an","start":2863.65,"duration":3.6},{"text":"element of truth both of them in that","start":2864.76,"duration":4.89},{"text":"like you know be harming people on the","start":2867.25,"duration":5.49},{"text":"one hand and also also like this this","start":2869.65,"duration":4.86},{"text":"technology needs to be iterated and","start":2872.74,"duration":3.54},{"text":"there needs to be sort of publication","start":2874.51,"duration":4.44},{"text":"and sort of you know models getting out","start":2876.28,"duration":4.17},{"text":"there in the world in order for there to","start":2878.95,"duration":3.36},{"text":"be sort of learning by doing and","start":2880.45,"duration":3.78},{"text":"ultimately figuring out how to solve","start":2882.31,"duration":3.99},{"text":"those problems so you know definitely","start":2884.23,"duration":5.04},{"text":"definitely um you know you know you","start":2886.3,"duration":5.4},{"text":"could say conflicts there and you know","start":2889.27,"duration":3.42},{"text":"in case of jeebies you there were","start":2891.7,"duration":2.22},{"text":"definitely a bunch of different","start":2892.69,"duration":2.64},{"text":"perspectives internally at open the eye","start":2893.92,"duration":2.939},{"text":"and you know ultimately we had to","start":2895.33,"duration":4.23},{"text":"wrangle that into a consensus view but","start":2896.859,"duration":5.101},{"text":"you can see the like ambiguity and the","start":2899.56,"duration":3.87},{"text":"fact that we were like hedging a lot of","start":2901.96,"duration":3.12},{"text":"our claims like yeah we're not sure how","start":2903.43,"duration":2.55},{"text":"dangerous this is","start":2905.08,"duration":3.509},{"text":"you know things you know one step at a","start":2905.98,"duration":5.25},{"text":"time those because you know there were","start":2908.589,"duration":4.5},{"text":"actual you know different there were","start":2911.23,"duration":3.48},{"text":"actual like different heating values","start":2913.089,"duration":3.721},{"text":"like there was like a you know there was","start":2914.71,"duration":3.3},{"text":"you know I wouldn't say it's like","start":2916.81,"duration":2.43},{"text":"totally zero sound but there was like","start":2918.01,"duration":3.359},{"text":"some zero-sum Ness between sort of like","start":2919.24,"duration":5.55},{"text":"avoiding a harm if it turned out that","start":2921.369,"duration":4.861},{"text":"you beat you is very dangerous

sense for like what","start":2933.73,"duration":5.22},{"text":"all the policies would need to be to","start":2935.17,"duration":5.82},{"text":"like unlike climate change like where","start":2938.95,"duration":3.54},{"text":"it's it's pretty maybe more clear what","start":2940.99,"duration":4.2},{"text":"the sensible policies are are there are","start":2942.49,"duration":6.06},{"text":"there some things that you policies that","start":2945.19,"duration":5.1},{"text":"you would enact if you if you had","start":2948.55,"duration":3.18},{"text":"control or if you could like you know","start":2950.29,"duration":3.27},{"text":"recommend a few things to say like the","start":2951.73,"duration":3.96},{"text":"US government like what would what would","start":2953.56,"duration":6.059},{"text":"those things be yeah so some of the some","start":2955.69,"duration":5.85},{"text":"of the stuff that we flagged in the the","start":2959.619,"duration":3.301},{"text":"toward trustworthy eye development","start":2961.54,"duration":2.7},{"text":"report I would I would definitely","start":2962.92,"duration":3.36},{"text":"consider here so stuff like computes for","start":2964.24,"duration":5.64},{"text":"Frankie me yeah I think generally like","start":2966.28,"duration":5.94},{"text":"at a super high level one policy change","start":2969.88,"duration":3.69},{"text":"that I'd like to see is there a more","start":2972.22,"duration":4.86},{"text":"robust support of academic research and","start":2973.57,"duration":6.24},{"text":"I you know including not just compute","start":2977.08,"duration":4.59},{"text":"but also things like data and just sort","start":2979.81,"duration":4.23},{"text":"of you know funding for academics so","start":2981.67,"duration":3.689},{"text":"that they're not constantly like writing","start":2984.04,"duration":3.329},{"text":"you know grant applications and you know","start":2985.359,"duration":3.991},{"text":"sort of I think there are lots of in","start":2987.369,"duration":3.271},{"text":"efficiencies and the way that the","start":2989.35,"duration":3.84},{"text":"American academic system works currently","start":2990.64,"duration":5.729},{"text":"so like more you know long term funding","start":2993.19,"duration":7.35},{"text":"of you know work in ready and privacy","start":2996.369,"duration":6.571},{"text":"would be good sort of more support for","start":3000.54,"duration":4.92},{"text":"working on things like bias because I","start":3002.94,"duration":4.83},{"text":"think what we're we're currently kind of","start":3005.46,"duration":3.78},{"text":"in a regime where there's a little bit","start":3007.77,"duration":3.75},{"text":"of funding here from you know Department","start":3009.24,"duration":3.93},{"text":"of Defense a little bit of funding here","start":3011.52,"duration":3.599},{"text":"from National Science Foundation and","start":3013.17,"duration":3.24},{"text":"then there's like you know everything","start":3015.119,"duration":3.511},{"text":"that industry is doing and what I'd like","start":3016.41,"duration":4.35},{"text":"to see is a world in which you know an","start":3018.63,"duration":5.61},{"text":"academic you know or you know postdoc or","start":3020.76,"duration":4.89},{"text":"something like that doesn't see a heat a","start":3024.24,"duration":4.379},{"text":"big trade-off between sort of working in","start":3025.65,"duration":4.77},{"text":"industry versus academia in terms of

have","start":3032.04,"duration":4.14},{"text":"because I think we'll see both faster","start":3033.38,"duration":4.72},{"text":"progress in AI and more creativity

be","start":3039.57,"duration":5.25},{"text":"constantly fighting over money but also","start":3041.43,"duration":6.42},{"text":"there are sort of areas that you know by","start":3044.82,"duration":5.22},{"text":"a necessity need to be worked on over","start":3047.85,"duration":4.14},{"text":"the long term so things like if you for","start":3050.04,"duration":3.45},{"text":"example you would you want that to be","start":3051.99,"duration":3.36},{"text":"like you're always an option for you","start":3053.49,"duration":3.78},{"text":"know ambitious grad students for work on","start":3055.35,"duration":3.09},{"text":"that but it's actually not really the","start":3057.27,"duration":2.88},{"text":"case today a lot of a lot of the time","start":3058.44,"duration":3.48},{"text":"today like you know one could go to grad","start":3060.15,"duration":3.45},{"text":"school and not find an easy way to work","start":3061.92,"duration":3.75},{"text":"on AI safety because you know a lot of","start":3063.6,"duration":3.9},{"text":"the grants available or it you know","start":3065.67,"duration":4.02},{"text":"permit of Defense on XY and Z or","start":3067.5,"duration":3.75},{"text":"something like that and yeah they do","start":3069.69,"duration":3.84},{"text":"fund some baby stuff but I would like to","start":3071.25,"duration":4.41},{"text":"see like more more balancing between the","start":3073.53,"duration":5.25},{"text":"civilian and decide and also sort of","start":3075.66,"duration":5.34},{"text":"more copy you know more robust long-term","start":3078.78,"duration":7.56},{"text":"funding that make sense for this what","start":3081.0,"duration":7.17},{"text":"about regulation would you would you","start":3086.34,"duration":4.019},{"text":"like push for ivory besides just like","start":3088.17,"duration":4.82},{"text":"what kind of more funding would you","start":3090.359,"duration":6.24},{"text":"would you want our government to enact","start":3092.99,"duration":6.7},{"text":"some like laws now around like putting","start":3096.599,"duration":6.991},{"text":"guardrails around like a research or","start":3099.69,"duration":5.13},{"text":"deployments or would you want them to","start":3103.59,"duration":3.72},{"text":"kind of wait and see until there's more","start":3104.82,"duration":4.799},{"text":"information yeah it's a good question I","start":3107.31,"duration":4.799},{"text":"think then I think my answer is like yes","start":3109.619,"duration":4.801},{"text":"they should do some stuff now in other","start":3112.109,"duration":4.201},{"text":"areas they should wait and see so I","start":3114.42,"duration":4.35},{"text":"think in areas like you know drive those","start":3116.31,"duration":4.11},{"text":"cars for example there's like already a","start":3118.77,"duration":3.42},{"text":"sort of clear you know reason to act","start":3120.42,"duration":3.48},{"text":"quickly and develop sort of sectors I","start":3122.19,"duration":4.169},{"text":"think regulations I think another area","start":3123.9,"duration":3.84},{"text":"where I'd like to see more progress in","start":3126.359,"duration":4.411},{"text":"developing you know clearer guidance for","start":3127.74,"duration":5.04},{"text":"you know sort of entrepreneurs and","start":3130.77,"duration":4.53},{"text":"others is health applications they I so","start":3132.78,"duration":5.55},{"text":"where there's like some effort to sort","start":3135.3,"duration":5.309},{"text":"of you know figure out how a I systems","start":3138.33,"duration":4.59},{"text":"should flow through the FDA for example","start":3140.609,"duration":3.841},{"text":"and you know what should that review","start":3142.92,"duration":3.3},{"text":"process look like I think that's an area","start":3144.45,"duration":5.61},{"text":"where it would be beneficial to see sort","start":3146.22,"duration":5.97},{"text":"of more investment in capacity and","start":3150.06,"duration":3.9},{"text":"expertise in the government so that they","start":3152.19,"duration":5.159},{"text":"have a better ability to process these","start":3153.96,"duration":5.52},{"text":"applications and also just like clear","start":3157.349,"duration":4.531},{"text":"sort of structures for getting AI","start":3159.48,"duration":4.2},{"text":"systems through a certain regulatory","start":3161.88,"duration":3.69},{"text":"process like that I think could be very","start":3163.68,"duration":4.38},{"text":"valuable I don't know exactly you know","start":3165.57,"duration":4.11},{"text":"what what the details of that should","start":3168.06,"duration":3.21},{"text":"look like but you know generally that's","start":3169.68,"duration":3.27},{"text":"something where yeah we do not want","start":3171.27,"duration":3.42},{"text":"people putting out you know sort of","start":3172.95,"duration":3.75},{"text":"health applications that you know or","start":3174.69,"duration":4.02},{"text":"causing harm but we also don't want you","start":3176.7,"duration":4.35},{"text":"know the o10 or health applications

I","start":3454.35,"duration":3.12},{"text":"could do it but now I want to try","start":3455.88,"duration":3.84},{"text":"yeah the over a few paragraphs part is","start":3457.47,"duration":3.75},{"text":"critical because yeah that's like one of","start":3459.72,"duration":3.36},{"text":"the one of the like robust findings that","start":3461.22,"duration":5.01},{"text":"both for humans and machines more","start":3463.08,"duration":4.37},{"text":"contact","start":3466.23,"duration":5.45},{"text":"you know so that's

a","start":3517.22,"duration":3.81},{"text":"complete model I guess like where do you","start":3518.78,"duration":4.71},{"text":"see the bottlenecks happening like","start":3521.03,"duration":4.62},{"text":"what's sort of the hardest piece of kind","start":3523.49,"duration":3.57},{"text":"of like getting something done and out","start":3525.65,"duration":5.16},{"text":"the door good question I mean a lot of","start":3527.06,"duration":6.66},{"text":"it seems like a lot of it is you

stuff","start":3537.44,"duration":4.23},{"text":"that y'all are you know and trying to","start":3540.05,"duration":3.69},{"text":"help out with is sort of getting the","start":3541.67,"duration":4.07},{"text":"getting the right type of parameters","start":3543.74,"duration":4.32},{"text":"obviously like compute as a

is","start":3552.71,"duration":5.73},{"text":"definitely always an uphill battle like","start":3556.43,"duration":4.38},{"text":"it's you know even if you're you know","start":3558.44,"duration":4.53},{"text":"have sort of good engineers who are good","start":3560.81,"duration":4.71},{"text":"at um you know gathering and

that","start":3566.84,"duration":3.72},{"text":"I call it a bottleneck but like","start":3569.09,"duration":3.33},{"text":"something to like push on is you know","start":3570.56,"duration":5.43},{"text":"quality of data yeah and just like ml","start":3572.42,"duration":5.55},{"text":"yeah really do the hyper parameter thing","start":3575.99,"duration":5.25},{"text":"is just like ml weirdness it's hard to","start":3577.97,"duration":5.37},{"text":"debug ml systems and like weird

set","start":3585.68,"duration":5.58},{"text":"well but yeah all of those lead to you","start":3587.96,"duration":6.18},{"text":"know various weird dynamics I mean I do","start":3591.26,"duration":3.99},{"text":"want to say for the record that I think","start":3594.14,"duration":4.68},{"text":"I hope that our product helps people","start":3595.25,"duration":4.44},{"text":"more with actually the kind of","start":3598.82,"duration":2.25},{"text":"collaboration that you're talking

casually","start":3616.609,"duration":5.13},{"text":"talking to folks on the team it seemed","start":3620.269,"duration":3.54},{"text":"like people felt like you're really","start":3621.739,"duration":4.5},{"text":"close and then you know took like two","start":3623.809,"duration":5.131},{"text":"years but then it actually got done but","start":3626.239,"duration":5.61},{"text":"over like a long period of time and like","start":3628.94,"duration":5.159},{"text":"what what happens and those that like a","start":3631.849,"duration":4.23},{"text":"year it's you're like what was your","start":3634.099,"duration":4.26},{"text":"perspective like what's that's

yeah","start":3639.619,"duration":9.95},{"text":"yeah I mean it's not just like you know","start":3642.65,"duration":10.319},{"text":"sort of silly just sort of tweaking the","start":3649.569,"duration":5.591},{"text":"hyper I think you might have like a","start":3652.969,"duration":5.431},{"text":"clearer perspective that's right

I","start":3685.519,"duration":4.74},{"text":"think you mentioned collaboration I","start":3687.92,"duration":4.829},{"text":"would say yeah just like knowing

internal","start":90.509,"duration":5.551},{"text":"projects all that kind of stuff","start":93.9,"duration":4.02},{"text":"so I started working with data

then","start":99.93,"duration":5.25},{"text":"for a job that I had in Philadelphia","start":102.11,"duration":5.98},{"text":"Comcast I started working with big

that","start":117.54,"duration":4.039},{"text":"it was starting to get really big","start":120.18,"duration":4.02},{"text":"started working with that tool stack and","start":121.579,"duration":4.871},{"text":"that involved me having to get a lot","start":124.2,"duration":4.529},{"text":"more technical so at the time I

with","start":131.73,"duration":4.83},{"text":"hi was still relatively new a lot of","start":133.83,"duration":5.07},{"text":"growing pains there so I started working","start":136.56,"duration":4.95},{"text":"with that stack and then from there I","start":138.9,"duration":5.37},{"text":"started doing more large-scale data","start":141.51,"duration":5.25},{"text":"science sampling programming all of that","start":144.27,"duration":4.65},{"text":"and then went on to my next job as

that","start":205.769,"duration":4.981},{"text":"kind of want to build out data science","start":207.72,"duration":5.28},{"text":"or data engineering platforms and","start":210.75,"duration":5.25},{"text":"usually they're starting from so usually","start":213.0,"duration":5.39},{"text":"the question will be do we have data

so","start":234.63,"duration":3.78},{"text":"that's where a lot of the challenges","start":236.88,"duration":3.9},{"text":"that I see are now interesting is it may","start":238.41,"duration":5.579},{"text":"be because you're going to companies now","start":240.78,"duration":4.65},{"text":"that are like a little bit further","start":243.989,"duration":3.991},{"text":"behind is that is that possible or like","start":245.43,"duration":4.38},{"text":"kind of starting from scratch or or do","start":247.98,"duration":3.06},{"text":"you think like something's changing","start":249.81,"duration":3.989},{"text":"where people sort of expect to have more","start":251.04,"duration":5.04},{"text":"built out processes and tools yeah I","start":253.799,"duration":4.5},{"text":"think it's the second one I think if you","start":256.08,"duration":5.909},{"text":"look at the landscape of whatever the","start":258.299,"duration":6.18},{"text":"data tools landscape map that Matt

and","start":267.51,"duration":5.49},{"text":"it was just like I do and that was it","start":269.76,"duration":5.37},{"text":"and now I think poor Matt has to put","start":273.0,"duration":5.25},{"text":"together like 500 logos into a single","start":275.13,"duration":5.97},{"text":"page and there's an orchestration

all","start":283.53,"duration":3.0},{"text":"that stuff","start":285.75,"duration":3.15},{"text":"so I think people also there's the","start":286.53,"duration":4.23},{"text":"expectation that if you have something","start":288.9,"duration":4.98},{"text":"it should be production izybelle and","start":290.76,"duration":4.56},{"text":"even to the point where we now have","start":293.88,"duration":3.45},{"text":"notebooks which are generally seen as","start":295.32,"duration":5.34},{"text":"like an exploration tool there's also","start":297.33,"duration":4.83},{"text":"some movement for example Netflix","start":300.66,"duration":3.78},{"text":"recently has had around production izing","start":302.16,"duration":2.79},{"text":"notebooks","start":304.44,"duration":3.03},{"text":"so whatever workflow you're looking at I","start":304.95,"duration":4.35},{"text":"think there's the expectation that in","start":307.47,"duration":9.12},{"text":"the end it'd be represent a lot of the","start":309.3,"duration":9.66},{"text":"kind of fortune 500 you know not","start":316.59,"duration":4.05},{"text":"necessarily Silicon Valley not I was","start":318.96,"duration":3.36},{"text":"kind of really enjoyed seeing the","start":320.64,"duration":3.06},{"text":"different perspectives and like all the","start":322.32,"duration":4.41},{"text":"different applications I how has it been","start":323.7,"duration":4.71},{"text":"for you as a consultant is it does it","start":326.73,"duration":3.3},{"text":"feel more like frustrating or exciting","start":328.41,"duration":3.3},{"text":"or I guess what is it like to kind of go","start":330.03,"duration":3.6},{"text":"into an organization and try to teach","start":331.71,"duration":3.36},{"text":"them how to I didn't know that these","start":333.63,"duration":3.84},{"text":"processes I think it's it's a little bit","start":335.07,"duration":3.09},{"text":"of both","start":337.47,"duration":4.11},{"text":"so it's interesting because consulting","start":338.16,"duration":6.9},{"text":"as a data scientist involves both and I","start":341.58,"duration":4.98},{"text":"think this is actually true of all data","start":345.06,"duration":3.21},{"text":"science but even more so consulting it","start":346.56,"duration":3.96},{"text":"involves both like the people piece and","start":348.27,"duration":5.13},{"text":"the technical piece so you have to know","start":350.52,"duration":4.17},{"text":"what you're doing technically because","start":353.4,"duration":3.21},{"text":"you're the expert when you come in the","start":354.69,"duration":4.17},{"text":"company and you have to say okay this is","start":356.61,"duration":4.11},{"text":"how we want to do the architecture but","start":358.86,"duration":3.03},{"text":"you're also going to be talking to","start":360.72,"duration":4.5},{"text":"people who maybe don't want this

be","start":367.08,"duration":3.6},{"text":"talking to people who are for it but","start":368.79,"duration":4.08},{"text":"don't necessarily understand it and so a","start":370.68,"duration":4.89},{"text":"lot of that work is actually talking to","start":372.87,"duration":4.86},{"text":"people and building the case for this","start":375.57,"duration":2.97},{"text":"stuff as well","start":377.73,"duration":3.99},{"text":"what is like what is a typical stack end","start":378.54,"duration":6.33},{"text":"up looking like these days uh-huh it's","start":381.72,"duration":5.31},{"text":"hard to say so I've dealt with both","start":384.87,"duration":5.34},{"text":"companies small and large a lot a lot of","start":387.03,"duration":5.55},{"text":"companies are increasingly in the cloud","start":390.21,"duration":5.19},{"text":"so it's interesting I don't think I have","start":392.58,"duration":7.56},{"text":"any GCP clients that I've dealt with AWS","start":395.4,"duration":6.07},{"text":"is of course probably","start":400.14,"duration":3.91},{"text":"and I did a Twitter question about this","start":401.47,"duration":4.17},{"text":"a couple months ago like who's using","start":404.05,"duration":4.65},{"text":"what AWS came out something like 60 to","start":405.64,"duration":6.42},{"text":"70 percent sure I'm surprised is really","start":408.7,"duration":7.47},{"text":"catching up I think even as little as","start":412.06,"duration":5.64},{"text":"two to three years ago they were","start":416.17,"duration":3.99},{"text":"squarely in third place no one was even","start":417.7,"duration":4.92},{"text":"considering them but now it's it's","start":420.16,"duration":3.9},{"text":"really growing and I think part of that","start":422.62,"duration":4.23},{"text":"is Microsoft's leadership plus the fact","start":424.06,"duration":5.28},{"text":"that a lot of companies in the retail","start":426.85,"duration":5.07},{"text":"space are not allowed to use AWS because","start":429.34,"duration":5.25},{"text":"they see them as a competitor and","start":431.92,"duration":4.71},{"text":"partially because they are stepping up","start":434.59,"duration":4.2},{"text":"their game in the tools that they're","start":436.63,"duration":4.5},{"text":"providing is there a particular offering","start":438.79,"duration":3.9},{"text":"from Azure that you like or you think is","start":441.13,"duration":3.77},{"text":"kind of driving some of this growth I","start":442.69,"duration":5.46},{"text":"actually ironically I haven't used Asher","start":444.9,"duration":5.68},{"text":"a lot most of my work has been in AWS","start":448.15,"duration":4.29},{"text":"but now that I'm seeing that people are","start":450.58,"duration":3.54},{"text":"more interested in it I'm definitely","start":452.44,"duration":3.08},{"text":"gonna have to start looking into it","start":454.12,"duration":4.59},{"text":"interesting what about um like is there","start":455.52,"duration":4.6},{"text":"any tool that you think is sort of like","start":458.71,"duration":3.51},{"text":"underrated that you know people like","start":460.12,"duration":3.45},{"text":"probably should be using or you you","start":462.22,"duration":4.58},{"text":"recommend what people aren't using yet I","start":463.57,"duration":12.0},{"text":"wanna say Bosch that's kind of a that's","start":466.8,"duration":11.08},{"text":"a really glib answer but it's really","start":475.57,"duration":4.74},{"text":"true because a lot of the times when you","start":477.88,"duration":5.55},{"text":"come into these big huge projects you","start":480.31,"duration":6.03},{"text":"have five or six different AWS

and","start":488.71,"duration":3.45},{"text":"then you start thinking okay well I have","start":490.03,"duration":3.9},{"text":"all this stuff how am I gonna use it for","start":492.16,"duration":5.91},{"text":"X well oh I can't test this locally I","start":493.93,"duration":6.45},{"text":"can't do this locally I can't sample the","start":498.07,"duration":4.53},{"text":"data what am I gonna do with it so I","start":500.38,"duration":4.02},{"text":"really do think and I find myself","start":502.6,"duration":4.47},{"text":"falling into this pattern to where you","start":504.4,"duration":4.74},{"text":"use all this big data stuff but then you","start":507.07,"duration":3.42},{"text":"don't use the stuff that you have","start":509.14,"duration":4.11},{"text":"available to you and it's even easier","start":510.49,"duration":5.46},{"text":"these days when a lot of us are working","start":513.25,"duration":4.71},{"text":"with pretty high powered machines that","start":515.95,"duration":5.06},{"text":"you can do a lot locally as well","start":517.96,"duration":4.949},{"text":"interesting so you you run a lot of","start":521.01,"duration":5.53},{"text":"stuff locally some yeah especially to","start":522.909,"duration":6.901},{"text":"test stuff to prototype and in cloud","start":526.54,"duration":5.13},{"text":"environments it's really hard to spin up","start":529.81,"duration":4.62},{"text":"those local environments so just even","start":531.67,"duration":3.48},{"text":"like","start":534.43,"duration":2.82},{"text":"look at the data to examine what you're","start":535.15,"duration":5.01},{"text":"dealing with all that stuff so you can","start":537.25,"duration":5.58},{"text":"do locally and you can bash bash goes a","start":540.16,"duration":5.19},{"text":"long way towards that so I know that you","start":542.83,"duration":3.78},{"text":"you know you can't talk about your","start":545.35,"duration":3.12},{"text":"individual customers but could you","start":546.61,"duration":4.23},{"text":"cannot talk broadly about the the sort","start":548.47,"duration":4.62},{"text":"of like questions that are driving

platform","start":563.8,"duration":4.68},{"text":"that they're not getting right now yes","start":566.26,"duration":4.8},{"text":"so the number one question is always to","start":568.48,"duration":5.58},{"text":"understand customers and understand what","start":571.06,"duration":5.22},{"text":"they're doing and understand how what","start":574.06,"duration":4.29},{"text":"the customers are doing ties directly to","start":576.28,"duration":4.08},{"text":"the bottom line and that manifests","start":578.35,"duration":4.65},{"text":"itself in a number of different ways the","start":580.36,"duration":4.83},{"text":"one that I usually talk about which I've","start":583.0,"duration":4.01},{"text":"also written a blog post about is churn","start":585.19,"duration":4.98},{"text":"everybody always wants to know churn

and","start":600.73,"duration":5.88},{"text":"then the second one is better","start":603.61,"duration":5.21},{"text":"understanding operational

interesting","start":617.35,"duration":5.61},{"text":"silence what's like a deliverable that","start":620.5,"duration":4.8},{"text":"you would give a company around

this","start":848.47,"duration":3.359},{"text":"month why is this metric different that","start":850.36,"duration":3.599},{"text":"month so a lot of the churn models I've","start":851.829,"duration":5.851},{"text":"built have been with pretty basic stuff","start":853.959,"duration":6.18},{"text":"like logistic regression and

mean","start":867.279,"duration":3.571},{"text":"the like decision trees versus logistic","start":868.899,"duration":3.091},{"text":"regression that they do kind

again","start":877.81,"duration":6.57},{"text":"depends on the data available usually if","start":880.57,"duration":6.0},{"text":"also depends on who's going to be","start":884.38,"duration":5.399},{"text":"looking at it usually if it's people at","start":886.57,"duration":6.0},{"text":"a higher level like executives that

model","start":905.29,"duration":4.38},{"text":"that spits out is this person gonna","start":907.39,"duration":5.28},{"text":"churn yes or no logistic regression is a","start":909.67,"duration":5.24},{"text":"little bit better for that but again","start":912.67,"duration":5.18},{"text":"depends on the the stack that they have","start":914.91,"duration":5.44},{"text":"there's different software packages that","start":917.85,"duration":4.479},{"text":"are better or worse for logistic","start":920.35,"duration":4.91},{"text":"regression so for example surprisingly","start":922.329,"duration":5.7},{"text":"Python as far as I know does not have","start":925.26,"duration":5.139},{"text":"very good decision tree support you","start":928.029,"duration":5.131},{"text":"could do X G boost which is not quite","start":930.399,"duration":5.591},{"text":"the same but it's it's","start":933.16,"duration":7.989},{"text":"multiple decision boost it boosted trees","start":935.99,"duration":8.31},{"text":"but it's not it doesn't offer like the","start":941.149,"duration":6.031},{"text":"nice visual interpretation I guess as","start":944.3,"duration":7.05},{"text":"much as the art part package so yeah it","start":947.18,"duration":5.46},{"text":"really depends on like what you have","start":951.35,"duration":4.38},{"text":"available what you can do all that kind","start":952.64,"duration":5.22},{"text":"of stuff but I would say all I need","start":955.73,"duration":3.84},{"text":"three of those are my goat cheese for","start":957.86,"duration":3.33},{"text":"that interesting so you'll build like a","start":959.57,"duration":5.329},{"text":"stable pipeline that includes our in it","start":961.19,"duration":7.32},{"text":"I've done it for stuff where I had to","start":964.899,"duration":6.731},{"text":"prototype and kind of like throw it out","start":968.51,"duration":5.13},{"text":"I actually have not built an

increasingly","start":975.32,"duration":4.49},{"text":"becoming more and more possible","start":977.48,"duration":5.82},{"text":"interesting so do you see um like do you","start":979.81,"duration":5.14},{"text":"feel like are is kind of like here to","start":983.3,"duration":2.789},{"text":"stay or do you feel like it's getting","start":984.95,"duration":3.18},{"text":"replaced by Python like where do you I","start":986.089,"duration":4.771},{"text":"mean I think there are two different","start":988.13,"duration":4.95},{"text":"tools for two different things","start":990.86,"duration":5.78},{"text":"so I think R is fantastic for statistics","start":993.08,"duration":6.36},{"text":"for stuff that you're working on in","start":996.64,"duration":6.639},{"text":"probably smaller teams and Python is","start":999.44,"duration":6.3},{"text":"more like of a general like if you need","start":1003.279,"duration":5.491},{"text":"to glue stuff together and if you need","start":1005.74,"duration":4.86},{"text":"to do deep learning and if you need to","start":1008.77,"duration":3.78},{"text":"have stuff and to end you'll use Python","start":1010.6,"duration":5.1},{"text":"but it's basic statistical capabilities","start":1012.55,"duration":7.4},{"text":"are not as good as a lot of VR

like","start":1023.47,"duration":5.27},{"text":"another person can update it like how","start":1026.17,"duration":4.649},{"text":"how does it happen do you like do you do","start":1028.74,"duration":3.31},{"text":"you ever check back in with like a","start":1030.819,"duration":3.571},{"text":"client and see if anyone's like touched","start":1032.05,"duration":3.899},{"text":"your model and it's still useful for","start":1034.39,"duration":4.02},{"text":"them that seems like it must be really","start":1035.949,"duration":5.431},{"text":"hard yeah so what we usually do is we","start":1038.41,"duration":5.82},{"text":"work side by side with the client so","start":1041.38,"duration":4.709},{"text":"we'll have a person on the client side","start":1044.23,"duration":4.229},{"text":"who is a data scientist so we can hand","start":1046.089,"duration":5.761},{"text":"it off or we'll have teams and so we do","start":1048.459,"duration":4.921},{"text":"education throughout the process so we","start":1051.85,"duration":3.09},{"text":"can hand it off and not just be like see","start":1053.38,"duration":3.6},{"text":"ya like this person knows how to pick it","start":1054.94,"duration":4.25},{"text":"up and notice how it was being built I","start":1056.98,"duration":4.17},{"text":"see I see if that makes sense","start":1059.19,"duration":3.94},{"text":"and you probably like pick the","start":1061.15,"duration":3.83},{"text":"technologies they're familiar with or","start":1063.13,"duration":3.9},{"text":"yeah for sure","start":1064.98,"duration":4.57},{"text":"yeah so we we try to pick","start":1067.03,"duration":4.32},{"text":"technologies that are not foreign to the","start":1069.55,"duration":3.21},{"text":"client so it's not like they're","start":1071.35,"duration":3.24},{"text":"completely floundering and gone and when","start":1072.76,"duration":4.92},{"text":"we hand over pi torch or something so","start":1074.59,"duration":5.1},{"text":"what's the biggest like what's the","start":1077.68,"duration":3.81},{"text":"biggest frustration and in this whole","start":1079.69,"duration":4.53},{"text":"process like where's like like where do","start":1081.49,"duration":4.14},{"text":"you see the biggest room for like","start":1084.22,"duration":3.09},{"text":"potential improvement like if you can I","start":1085.63,"duration":3.33},{"text":"mean I just I think we've both you know","start":1087.31,"duration":3.24},{"text":"kind of sold into big companies and you","start":1088.96,"duration":2.94},{"text":"know it's like you know it's challenging","start":1090.55,"duration":2.43},{"text":"like you do want to say bad things about","start":1091.9,"duration":2.82},{"text":"your clients but also you do feel","start":1092.98,"duration":3.09},{"text":"something like come on like this is","start":1094.72,"duration":3.15},{"text":"ridiculous guys do you ever do you have","start":1096.07,"duration":11.13},{"text":"any any patterns there I think so I","start":1097.87,"duration":11.52},{"text":"think I think the biggest issue is","start":1107.2,"duration":6.33},{"text":"trying to explain the benefit of machine","start":1109.39,"duration":6.09},{"text":"learning in a way where it's not always","start":1113.53,"duration":5.49},{"text":"exactly clear so like for example you'll","start":1115.48,"duration":5.91},{"text":"come to someone and they say okay well I","start":1119.02,"duration":4.11},{"text":"want to figure out customer churn and","start":1121.39,"duration":3.15},{"text":"you're like okay well build this model","start":1123.13,"duration":3.93},{"text":"but I can't guarantee that it's gonna be","start":1124.54,"duration":3.36},{"text":"good","start":1127.06,"duration":2.82},{"text":"I can't guarantee it's gonna be accurate","start":1127.9,"duration":3.99},{"text":"in the first pass but in the meantime","start":1129.88,"duration":4.86},{"text":"you have to figure out how long you're","start":1131.89,"duration":4.8},{"text":"gonna be at the client how much value","start":1134.74,"duration":3.96},{"text":"are gonna add so it's it's very very","start":1136.69,"duration":5.49},{"text":"hazy and I think that's a more for a","start":1138.7,"duration":5.73},{"text":"frustration for me but it's also like an","start":1142.18,"duration":4.53},{"text":"educational issue where you're not gonna","start":1144.43,"duration":6.51},{"text":"always get to a right answer like the","start":1146.71,"duration":6.96},{"text":"first sprint or the second sprint it's","start":1150.94,"duration":4.14},{"text":"gonna be an iterative process and","start":1153.67,"duration":3.36},{"text":"sometimes like if you add stuff the","start":1155.08,"duration":4.02},{"text":"model get worse if you take stuff away","start":1157.03,"duration":4.26},{"text":"the model will get better so it's it's","start":1159.1,"duration":5.04},{"text":"kind of hard because data science is","start":1161.29,"duration":5.22},{"text":"always sold or like I see it being sold","start":1164.14,"duration":4.26},{"text":"as this exact thing but it's very much","start":1166.51,"duration":5.64},{"text":"like an art process and so I think","start":1168.4,"duration":5.46},{"text":"that's where some of the frustration is","start":1172.15,"duration":3.84},{"text":"like it's not an exact thing and people","start":1173.86,"duration":4.32},{"text":"expect it to be and I can imagine it's","start":1175.99,"duration":4.08},{"text":"probably really hard going in like I","start":1178.18,"duration":3.57},{"text":"Prairie not knowing like the amount of","start":1180.07,"duration":3.36},{"text":"lift if somebody's like well I for sure","start":1181.75,"duration":3.71},{"text":"want this to get better it's like well","start":1183.43,"duration":4.17},{"text":"the data how would you how would you","start":1185.46,"duration":4.27},{"text":"know exactly how do you like articulate","start":1187.6,"duration":3.84},{"text":"that so like if someone's like hey you","start":1189.73,"duration":4.14},{"text":"know tell me like how much you know","start":1191.44,"duration":5.97},{"text":"you're gonna improve my turn prediction","start":1193.87,"duration":7.68},{"text":"what would you say to that yeah that's","start":1197.41,"duration":5.899},{"text":"that's a good one I think","start":1201.55,"duration":4.859},{"text":"first I don't know I've actually never","start":1203.309,"duration":6.34},{"text":"had it happen that someone was like you","start":1206.409,"duration":5.791},{"text":"have to improve my model by this much","start":1209.649,"duration":6.091},{"text":"it's usually like let's create a model","start":1212.2,"duration":7.319},{"text":"to do X Y or Z but what we usually do is","start":1215.74,"duration":6.899},{"text":"benchmark against previous metrics that","start":1219.519,"duration":6.51},{"text":"they have and so the goal there is to","start":1222.639,"duration":4.951},{"text":"say look we we're not sure how much we","start":1226.029,"duration":3.0},{"text":"can improve your model but we can","start":1227.59,"duration":3.9},{"text":"improve the process around the model so","start":1229.029,"duration":5.461},{"text":"that it can be a little clearer when you","start":1231.49,"duration":5.61},{"text":"look at like like the kind of successful","start":1234.49,"duration":4.799},{"text":"engagements where you feel like you you","start":1237.1,"duration":3.6},{"text":"know you really made a difference

patterns","start":1242.549,"duration":4.48},{"text":"like did like other things that kind of","start":1244.69,"duration":4.469},{"text":"you're you're sort of more successful","start":1247.029,"duration":3.87},{"text":"clients are doing around data science","start":1249.159,"duration":4.951},{"text":"that sets them up for success usually","start":1250.899,"duration":7.26},{"text":"working in a tight loop with me so a lot","start":1254.11,"duration":5.939},{"text":"of the times the companies I work at","start":1258.159,"duration":4.14},{"text":"will be bigger and so the data science","start":1260.049,"duration":4.11},{"text":"team will be on one side the data","start":1262.299,"duration":3.781},{"text":"engineering team will be on one side the","start":1264.159,"duration":3.451},{"text":"project management team will be","start":1266.08,"duration":4.29},{"text":"somewhere over there and so I'll talk to","start":1267.61,"duration":5.789},{"text":"all of them but they don't talk to each","start":1270.37,"duration":7.169},{"text":"other necessarily and so what I've seen","start":1273.399,"duration":6.951},{"text":"work best is when I'm embedded with a","start":1277.539,"duration":5.941},{"text":"developer a data scientist a project","start":1280.35,"duration":4.66},{"text":"manager they're all kind of

we","start":1291.85,"duration":4.98},{"text":"have like a single data science function","start":1294.07,"duration":4.14},{"text":"or should we sort of embed the data","start":1296.83,"duration":3.12},{"text":"scientists and have the different kind","start":1298.21,"duration":4.949},{"text":"of you know functional teams hire

that","start":1311.5,"duration":4.139},{"text":"it's better to keep it all as like a","start":1314.11,"duration":3.179},{"text":"single function so you can you know","start":1315.639,"duration":3.181},{"text":"maybe hire better people or create a","start":1317.289,"duration":4.5},{"text":"better culture yeah I'm not really sure","start":1318.82,"duration":4.739},{"text":"I have an opinion on that I've seen it","start":1321.789,"duration":4.74},{"text":"work well different ways in

a","start":1329.2,"duration":4.439},{"text":"thousand people or so you probably want","start":1331.389,"duration":5.141},{"text":"to have a centralized","start":1333.639,"duration":5.801},{"text":"for

both","start":1359.12,"duration":10.37},{"text":"yeah yeah for sure I see do you see like","start":1360.83,"duration":11.31},{"text":"do you see like the like specific stages","start":1369.49,"duration":4.42},{"text":"where you're like kind of prototyping","start":1372.14,"duration":3.48},{"text":"something and then deploy it into","start":1373.91,"duration":4.08},{"text":"production it sounds like it's something","start":1375.62,"duration":3.6},{"text":"you really focus on sort of

steps","start":1381.35,"duration":3.33},{"text":"first and then solidify them or how do","start":1382.88,"duration":4.53},{"text":"you think about that yeah simply say to","start":1384.68,"duration":4.26},{"text":"a client like we're gonna prototype and","start":1387.41,"duration":4.17},{"text":"then we're gonna deploy yeah that's","start":1388.94,"duration":5.37},{"text":"that's usually what we do so usually I","start":1391.58,"duration":5.19},{"text":"come into an environment and you're not","start":1394.31,"duration":4.41},{"text":"really clear on what's going on in the","start":1396.77,"duration":4.41},{"text":"environment at all right you're just","start":1398.72,"duration":5.64},{"text":"kind of thrown in and say okay go so the","start":1401.18,"duration":5.73},{"text":"first step is to gather and assess","start":1404.36,"duration":4.83},{"text":"what's going on what tools are they","start":1406.91,"duration":4.65},{"text":"using who are the key people involved in","start":1409.19,"duration":5.31},{"text":"this gather all of that out and then","start":1411.56,"duration":6.36},{"text":"start to create a model from whatever","start":1414.5,"duration":5.73},{"text":"data that you have available see if you","start":1417.92,"duration":4.74},{"text":"can actually create that model and then","start":1420.23,"duration":4.77},{"text":"then many Sprint's later take that model","start":1422.66,"duration":4.29},{"text":"to production it's usually never you","start":1425.0,"duration":3.63},{"text":"come in you create something and then","start":1426.95,"duration":5.19},{"text":"it's it's already running it's usually a","start":1428.63,"duration":6.0},{"text":"lot a lot of human steps in the middle","start":1432.14,"duration":4.8},{"text":"to get it to that point and so what's","start":1434.63,"duration":3.51},{"text":"the biggest like when you think about","start":1436.94,"duration":2.55},{"text":"like kind of taking I mean I feel like","start":1438.14,"duration":3.72},{"text":"everyone always underestimates the pain","start":1439.49,"duration":3.87},{"text":"of taking like a prototype into","start":1441.86,"duration":3.99},{"text":"production like what what are the what","start":1443.36,"duration":3.84},{"text":"are the biggest challenges that people","start":1445.85,"duration":3.27},{"text":"might not expect or don't usually expect","start":1447.2,"duration":4.76},{"text":"kind of going into that process","start":1449.12,"duration":5.67},{"text":"packaging the model is always a big one","start":1451.96,"duration":5.29},{"text":"how do you package it so how do you","start":1454.79,"duration":3.96},{"text":"typically package it how's it like what","start":1457.25,"duration":3.63},{"text":"are the options I you could you could","start":1458.75,"duration":5.34},{"text":"pickle it you could create a rest","start":1460.88,"duration":5.52},{"text":"endpoint from it you could put the model","start":1464.09,"duration":4.339},{"text":"in a docker container and expose","start":1466.4,"duration":3.93},{"text":"endpoints from it I think that's","start":1468.429,"duration":3.671},{"text":"something that I've seen happen more and","start":1470.33,"duration":4.079},{"text":"more frequently where the resulting","start":1472.1,"duration":5.91},{"text":"output is essentially a web app or a web","start":1474.409,"duration":5.971},{"text":"service and something hits that web","start":1478.01,"duration":4.32},{"text":"service and you get an inference point","start":1480.38,"duration":6.0},{"text":"all right yeah I would say those are the","start":1482.33,"duration":7.41},{"text":"two too big ways right now","start":1486.38,"duration":5.669},{"text":"I think another big thing that people","start":1489.74,"duration":4.02},{"text":"don't think about a lot is metadata","start":1492.049,"duration":4.291},{"text":"management and a lot of big companies","start":1493.76,"duration":5.94},{"text":"want to do metadata management in fact","start":1496.34,"duration":5.459},{"text":"I've I think almost every company that","start":1499.7,"duration":3.3},{"text":"I've talked to over the last five years","start":1501.799,"duration":3.541},{"text":"I said we need some way to manage all","start":1503.0,"duration":3.899},{"text":"the metadata and the data Lake so with","start":1505.34,"duration":3.089},{"text":"that we can update the models and so the","start":1506.899,"duration":3.39},{"text":"analysts can do the analysis but there's","start":1508.429,"duration":4.081},{"text":"no single tool for it and I think only","start":1510.289,"duration":6.51},{"text":"now have open source tools start coming","start":1512.51,"duration":6.36},{"text":"out for it like what was it Amundsen was","start":1516.799,"duration":4.47},{"text":"it where that came out with Amundsen I","start":1518.87,"duration":5.039},{"text":"forgot but there's at least a couple of","start":1521.269,"duration":4.29},{"text":"companies that have like a metadata","start":1523.909,"duration":4.531},{"text":"management and so the metadata is which","start":1525.559,"duration":4.73},{"text":"variables are in the model when was this","start":1528.44,"duration":4.14},{"text":"model updated when was this table","start":1530.289,"duration":4.421},{"text":"updated all that kind of stuff and","start":1532.58,"duration":4.709},{"text":"surprisingly people actually clamor for","start":1534.71,"duration":5.069},{"text":"that more so than even visibility into","start":1537.289,"duration":5.341},{"text":"how to manage the model and so this is","start":1539.779,"duration":5.61},{"text":"you give I was kind of curious what","start":1542.63,"duration":4.169},{"text":"you're gonna say but like what the","start":1545.389,"duration":2.701},{"text":"minute it is but it sounds like you give","start":1546.799,"duration":2.791},{"text":"examples of like this there's metadata","start":1548.09,"duration":3.63},{"text":"about the actual input data and there's","start":1549.59,"duration":3.54},{"text":"also metadata about like what the model","start":1551.72,"duration":3.48},{"text":"actually doing correct like both are","start":1553.13,"duration":6.99},{"text":"important yeah yeah I was just gonna say","start":1555.2,"duration":7.14},{"text":"yeah the biggest one is usually people","start":1560.12,"duration":4.74},{"text":"create data leaks they throw everything","start":1562.34,"duration":5.939},{"text":"into unstructured environments like s3","start":1564.86,"duration":5.52},{"text":"and then they need to understand what's","start":1568.279,"duration":3.87},{"text":"actually going into those environments","start":1570.38,"duration":2.88},{"text":"and where it's coming from","start":1572.149,"duration":3.181},{"text":"which is where the metadata piece comes","start":1573.26,"duration":5.159},{"text":"from and I guess what kinds of trouble","start":1575.33,"duration":5.04},{"text":"do people run into from like not having","start":1578.419,"duration":4.74},{"text":"like a like you know standardized","start":1580.37,"duration":4.169},{"text":"metadata like what are the issues that","start":1583.159,"duration":4.531},{"text":"come up well they wouldn't know for","start":1584.539,"duration":5.671},{"text":"example which tables they can use for","start":1587.69,"duration":6.079},{"text":"what when those tables are being updated","start":1590.21,"duration":8.49},{"text":"how much like whether those a big thing","start":1593.769,"duration":6.611},{"text":"for big companies is whether that data","start":1598.7,"duration":3.9},{"text":"is proprietary or not whether they're","start":1600.38,"duration":3.93},{"text":"actually allowed to use it","start":1602.6,"duration":5.24},{"text":"there's all sorts of controls around PII","start":1604.31,"duration":5.91},{"text":"all that kind of stuff and then usually","start":1607.84,"duration":5.08},{"text":"for that data like analyst will also","start":1610.22,"duration":4.08},{"text":"want to query it and they won't know","start":1612.92,"duration":4.14},{"text":"what's in there at all so it's another","start":1614.3,"duration":5.25},{"text":"way to surface it in a way so that it","start":1617.06,"duration":3.9},{"text":"doesn't impact production so when","start":1619.55,"duration":2.58},{"text":"analysts are heading it","start":1620.96,"duration":3.15},{"text":"for example they don't pick like the","start":1622.13,"duration":4.89},{"text":"entire redshift table or the entire","start":1624.11,"duration":4.29},{"text":"thing in bigquery","start":1627.02,"duration":4.38},{"text":"it's just they they know what the data","start":1628.4,"duration":4.71},{"text":"is what's available and what they can","start":1631.4,"duration":4.14},{"text":"take from it and what they get and so","start":1633.11,"duration":3.48},{"text":"are most of the models that you're","start":1635.54,"duration":3.21},{"text":"building are they running in kind of","start":1636.59,"duration":4.86},{"text":"like online mode or like are they do","start":1638.75,"duration":5.75},{"text":"they kind of run off plan in batches or","start":1641.45,"duration":6.33},{"text":"a mix I would say most of the models","start":1644.5,"duration":6.46},{"text":"that we built for clients are online or","start":1647.78,"duration":6.15},{"text":"I'm sorry our batches I'm working on a","start":1650.96,"duration":8.46},{"text":"personal project now that's online yeah","start":1653.93,"duration":9.09},{"text":"I'm actually almost done with it so I'm","start":1659.42,"duration":9.65},{"text":"working on learning GPT too and so it's","start":1663.02,"duration":9.53},{"text":"like a medium think piece generator oh","start":1669.07,"duration":13.45},{"text":"no that's too dangerous - really yes so","start":1672.55,"duration":11.77},{"text":"the idea is that you put in like the","start":1682.52,"duration":5.22},{"text":"first few sentences of VC blog posts in","start":1684.32,"duration":5.25},{"text":"there and it generates like a medium","start":1687.74,"duration":5.01},{"text":"think piece for you so hopefully that'll","start":1689.57,"duration":6.72},{"text":"be online but my inference time is five","start":1692.75,"duration":6.06},{"text":"minutes right now so maybe it won't","start":1696.29,"duration":5.06},{"text":"we'll see","start":1698.81,"duration":2.54},{"text":"do you do any kind of like monitoring of","start":1705.16,"duration":7.12},{"text":"these models is that like an issue like","start":1710.6,"duration":3.24},{"text":"cuz I could sometimes we'll talk about","start":1712.28,"duration":3.57},{"text":"like oh you know the input data changes","start":1713.84,"duration":4.2},{"text":"and nobody notices then the the model","start":1715.85,"duration":4.53},{"text":"gets broken nobody notices is that like","start":1718.04,"duration":5.19},{"text":"a real issue that you've seen yeah so a","start":1720.38,"duration":5.06},{"text":"lot of the I think we're just starting","start":1723.23,"duration":4.98},{"text":"starting this as an industry I know","start":1725.44,"duration":3.7},{"text":"there's a lot of talk about","start":1728.21,"duration":3.51},{"text":"observability and caching model

is","start":1746.0,"duration":5.04},{"text":"okay and that's kind of like the level","start":1748.07,"duration":5.25},{"text":"of checking where we are and I think","start":1751.04,"duration":4.29},{"text":"people are just starting to say okay","start":1753.32,"duration":3.57},{"text":"well this is where the model was","start":1755.33,"duration":3.96},{"text":"yesterday this is hard as today and this","start":1756.89,"duration":6.44},{"text":"is where it should be tomorrow

are","start":1816.62,"duration":14.25},{"text":"like my most common cool well yeah we","start":1820.7,"duration":11.64},{"text":"always end with a couple questions I'm","start":1830.87,"duration":3.21},{"text":"gonna touch on some of these but I'd be","start":1832.34,"duration":3.14},{"text":"really curious to kind of hear your","start":1834.08,"duration":3.78},{"text":"perspective on this so what's like an","start":1835.48,"duration":3.88},{"text":"underrated aspects of machine learning","start":1837.86,"duration":3.18},{"text":"that you think people don't pay enough","start":1839.36,"duration":7.32},{"text":"attention to mmm I think I touched on","start":1841.04,"duration":8.37},{"text":"this earlier but like the people part of","start":1846.68,"duration":5.88},{"text":"machine learning if you are able to get","start":1849.41,"duration":6.15},{"text":"more data or better data from people","start":1852.56,"duration":5.43},{"text":"rather than banging your head against","start":1855.56,"duration":4.17},{"text":"the smaller model that's it's always","start":1857.99,"duration":4.59},{"text":"gonna go better than trying to figure","start":1859.73,"duration":5.91},{"text":"out like an advanced model for it","start":1862.58,"duration":5.16},{"text":"you've also touched on this a fair","start":1865.64,"duration":3.51},{"text":"amount but I'm curious how you'll","start":1867.74,"duration":3.63},{"text":"synthesize it so what is the biggest","start":1869.15,"duration":4.98},{"text":"talans of machine learning and the work","start":1871.37,"duration":5.22},{"text":"in the real world right now putting","start":1874.13,"duration":4.74},{"text":"stuff in production putting stuff in","start":1876.59,"duration":3.99},{"text":"production putting stuff in production","start":1878.87,"duration":2.79},{"text":"yeah and I'm like what's in that what's","start":1880.58,"duration":2.67},{"text":"the hardest part open seven crunching oh","start":1881.66,"duration":3.84},{"text":"because there's there's so much that you","start":1883.25,"duration":4.41},{"text":"need to get right in order to make","start":1885.5,"duration":3.75},{"text":"because it's it's not just like a","start":1887.66,"duration":5.25},{"text":"software system well it's it's just as","start":1889.25,"duration":4.89},{"text":"complicated but even more because","start":1892.91,"duration":3.81},{"text":"software's you have a piece of code you","start":1894.14,"duration":4.26},{"text":"put it in docker you put it somewhere","start":1896.72,"duration":4.02},{"text":"and it goes this is you have to keep","start":1898.4,"duration":4.5},{"text":"track of data that's flowing in from","start":1900.74,"duration":4.98},{"text":"Kafka or Kinesis or streaming you have","start":1902.9,"duration":4.17},{"text":"to make sure that all that data is","start":1905.72,"duration":2.67},{"text":"correct you have to make sure

that","start":1914.03,"duration":5.76},{"text":"data then you create your models your","start":1916.4,"duration":5.43},{"text":"models might work one day you might get","start":1919.79,"duration":4.08},{"text":"drift the next day so you have to plan","start":1921.83,"duration":3.9},{"text":"for that and like I said I think we're","start":1923.87,"duration":3.3},{"text":"still in the early stages of planning","start":1925.73,"duration":4.829},{"text":"for that then you have to expose your","start":1927.17,"duration":6.06},{"text":"model to some service or some endpoint","start":1930.559,"duration":5.611},{"text":"that's going to consume it the model","start":1933.23,"duration":5.13},{"text":"piece itself you have to put somewhere","start":1936.17,"duration":6.3},{"text":"like docker or whatever you have to make","start":1938.36,"duration":6.33},{"text":"sure to orchestrate all of that so this","start":1942.47,"duration":5.13},{"text":"is very similar software except and so I","start":1944.69,"duration":4.86},{"text":"think we like in modern software","start":1947.6,"duration":3.66},{"text":"development we have a lot of pieces of","start":1949.55,"duration":3.36},{"text":"the stack that we're now responsible for","start":1951.26,"duration":4.83},{"text":"because of DevOps so DevOps means like","start":1952.91,"duration":5.31},{"text":"in theory it's supposed to make it","start":1956.09,"duration":3.81},{"text":"easier for you but it what it means is","start":1958.22,"duration":4.11},{"text":"that the software developer also now has","start":1959.9,"duration":4.92},{"text":"to be a sysadmin and understand some

that","start":817.43,"duration":2.88},{"text":"you're in production doing this stuff","start":818.93,"duration":4.65},{"text":"and yeah yeah so the modeling team out","start":820.31,"duration":5.07},{"text":"of the machine learning team all up is","start":823.58,"duration":5.1},{"text":"actually a small size so I think they're","start":825.38,"duration":5.04},{"text":"about a quarter of the size of the full","start":828.68,"duration":6.09},{"text":"team so the modeling team they're

just","start":927.92,"duration":4.339},{"text":"the individual algorithm metrics","start":929.78,"duration":4.789},{"text":"and and just to complement that

R&D","start":942.879,"duration":6.781},{"text":"side of the equation and there are the","start":945.489,"duration":5.58},{"text":"teams that she's going to continue to","start":949.66,"duration":3.119},{"text":"talk about there's the four teams within","start":951.069,"duration":3.87},{"text":"the machine learning proper and

a","start":956.85,"duration":5.289},{"text":"program so if it's a specific robot or a","start":959.589,"duration":5.64},{"text":"specific feature or specific

that's","start":981.129,"duration":5.64},{"text":"the milk stool is the product team so we","start":984.549,"duration":4.26},{"text":"have business counterparts who sort

that","start":1027.899,"duration":5.37},{"text":"sort of spans the gamut but for instance","start":1030.6,"duration":4.89},{"text":"on the the first team that Danielle was","start":1033.269,"duration":4.56},{"text":"talking about the the modeling team the","start":1035.49,"duration":4.199},{"text":"way that they talk to their business","start":1037.829,"duration":4.95},{"text":"counterpart is almost similar to the way","start":1039.689,"duration":4.531},{"text":"that they talk to the integration

that","start":1060.6,"duration":3.929},{"text":"it actually has to do as well and so","start":1062.19,"duration":3.6},{"text":"that it","start":1064.529,"duration":4.321},{"text":"truly is a really

up","start":1070.65,"duration":3.21},{"text":"with the solution and they come out and","start":1072.39,"duration":5.13},{"text":"toss it over the fence mmm yeah yeah","start":1073.86,"duration":6.3},{"text":"definitely good good Kampala so after","start":1077.52,"duration":4.26},{"text":"that integration team there's a team","start":1080.16,"duration":3.66},{"text":"that's focused on actually what you were","start":1081.78,"duration":3.84},{"text":"mentioning before look is the platform","start":1083.82,"duration":3.81},{"text":"or an Operations team so that's separate","start":1085.62,"duration":3.39},{"text":"from the integration team and this

both","start":1090.63,"duration":4.65},{"text":"modeling and integration work so things","start":1092.25,"duration":5.25},{"text":"like what's uh how do we scale out or","start":1095.28,"duration":3.96},{"text":"compute how do we train our models and","start":1097.5,"duration":3.9},{"text":"store models and things like that so how","start":1099.24,"duration":3.69},{"text":"do you like how do you think about the","start":1101.4,"duration":5.28},{"text":"different like skill set between that","start":1102.93,"duration":7.29},{"text":"team and the integrations team so the","start":1106.68,"duration":6.36},{"text":"integration team is a lot in our case","start":1110.22,"duration":5.04},{"text":"because we're deploying on a robot there","start":1113.04,"duration":4.92},{"text":"they also have often received plus

have","start":1119.88,"duration":4.47},{"text":"built some experience around the robot","start":1121.55,"duration":5.53},{"text":"software so the integration team is more","start":1124.35,"duration":5.16},{"text":"focused on how do we make this stuff","start":1127.08,"duration":5.04},{"text":"real on the robot versus the

build","start":1144.9,"duration":4.47},{"text":"servantless applications on the cloud to","start":1147.03,"duration":4.47},{"text":"support those different those different","start":1149.37,"duration":6.12},{"text":"applications and the yeah we found that","start":1151.5,"duration":6.63},{"text":"having an integration team separate

of","start":1159.39,"duration":5.16},{"text":"advanced solutions is really important","start":1162.18,"duration":5.22},{"text":"exactly because of this the the last","start":1164.55,"duration":5.82},{"text":"mile of deploying machine learning to","start":1167.4,"duration":5.67},{"text":"production is really long and we have","start":1170.37,"duration":5.73},{"text":"all of the Edit complexity that our last","start":1173.07,"duration":6.06},{"text":"mile is on an incredibly

to","start":1187.47,"duration":5.76},{"text":"focusing on just how hard that last mile","start":1190.53,"duration":7.2},{"text":"is has really paid off in terms of yes","start":1193.23,"duration":6.06},{"text":"it's added complexity have","start":1197.73,"duration":3.54},{"text":"and hold another team edits","start":1199.29,"duration":4.79},{"text":"specialization like we that's not free","start":1201.27,"duration":7.1},{"text":"but it's definitely been net positive","start":1204.08,"duration":7.24},{"text":"and what's the it's the last team so the","start":1208.37,"duration":4.63},{"text":"last team is a reinforcement

often","start":1256.44,"duration":6.51},{"text":"overlooked part is is aspects around how","start":1259.2,"duration":5.79},{"text":"do we deal with data and how does the","start":1262.95,"duration":3.63},{"text":"data feed the rest of the systems so","start":1264.99,"duration":4.32},{"text":"even folks who are supporting the

it's","start":1308.94,"duration":5.46},{"text":"actually not that hard to hire I mean","start":1312.15,"duration":4.47},{"text":"yes it is because this is a you know a","start":1314.4,"duration":4.98},{"text":"very specialized skill set that we're","start":1316.62,"duration":4.68},{"text":"looking for given that we've reached

this","start":2317.39,"duration":3.81},{"text":"sort of like kind of end to end sort of","start":2318.71,"duration":4.68},{"text":"product or business metrics or do you","start":2321.2,"duration":4.25},{"text":"mean something like specific to that","start":2323.39,"duration":5.82},{"text":"so both the actually both I'm so with","start":2325.45,"duration":6.099},{"text":"model metrics that come out as well as","start":2329.21,"duration":4.2},{"text":"how do that model performs in the

we","start":2352.309,"duration":4.04},{"text":"think about approaching that problem","start":2353.96,"duration":5.19},{"text":"interesting interesting","start":2356.349,"duration":5.351},{"text":"and

these","start":2364.359,"duration":4.75},{"text":"metrics has that been important yeah I","start":2367.579,"duration":2.701},{"text":"mean some people say oh it's just about","start":2369.109,"duration":2.881},{"text":"the data some people say well no like","start":2370.28,"duration":3.539},{"text":"you know deeper more sophisticated","start":2371.99,"duration":4.23},{"text":"models they really matter some people","start":2373.819,"duration":3.961},{"text":"think hyper parameter search is a really","start":2376.22,"duration":2.94},{"text":"good idea in some applications it seems","start":2377.78,"duration":2.579},{"text":"like it doesn't help very much like","start":2379.16,"duration":3.06},{"text":"where do you stand on those those types","start":2380.359,"duration":7.71},{"text":"of things so I'd say data first for her","start":2382.22,"duration":8.76},{"text":"for our use cases the because we're","start":2388.069,"duration":6.75},{"text":"trying to hit all of the use all of the","start":2390.98,"duration":6.45},{"text":"houses to be able to generalize to the","start":2394.819,"duration":5.651},{"text":"world and all the variety of the

the","start":2402.46,"duration":5.1},{"text":"most important but the physical world","start":2405.16,"duration":5.76},{"text":"the physical world yeah so thresholds","start":2407.56,"duration":5.34},{"text":"are thresholds between you know one room","start":2410.92,"duration":5.67},{"text":"and the other the architecture of you","start":2412.9,"duration":7.2},{"text":"know 1800s Germany is something that you","start":2416.59,"duration":5.58},{"text":"really can't modify like houses in","start":2420.1,"duration":4.11},{"text":"Berlin will be the way that they are and","start":2422.17,"duration":6.63},{"text":"so it's it's really it's a different","start":2424.21,"duration":7.14},{"text":"world when you're talking about a robot","start":2428.8,"duration":4.68},{"text":"that we're going to be improving these","start":2431.35,"duration":3.54},{"text":"models we're going to be sending new","start":2433.48,"duration":5.19},{"text":"models over an over the air update

environment","start":2441.04,"duration":4.53},{"text":"within which it operates is static and","start":2442.87,"duration":5.16},{"text":"so that's that's the constraint which is","start":2445.57,"duration":4.59},{"text":"why we value the data collection so much","start":2448.03,"duration":5.54},{"text":"because of that sort of constraint","start":2450.16,"duration":5.91},{"text":"essentially yeah absolutely","start":2453.57,"duration":5.19},{"text":"and the other aspect is is the","start":2456.07,"duration":5.25},{"text":"algorithms that run on low compute I","start":2458.76,"duration":5.17},{"text":"think the advancements that happen in","start":2461.32,"duration":5.28},{"text":"that space there are thing little things","start":2463.93,"duration":3.81},{"text":"that you can do that make a big","start":2466.6,"duration":5.07},{"text":"difference so the thinking about that","start":2467.74,"duration":6.3},{"text":"area I think there is a lot of room to","start":2471.67,"duration":4.92},{"text":"go in terms of how how much algorithm","start":2474.04,"duration":5.13},{"text":"improvements can make a difference that","start":2476.59,"duration":4.14},{"text":"they've made they matter to your last","start":2479.17,"duration":3.63},{"text":"couple years like the stuff that's","start":2480.73,"duration":4.59},{"text":"that's been really meaningful yes yes","start":2482.8,"duration":5.22},{"text":"especially advances in inference time

the","start":2489.58,"duration":4.17},{"text":"small differences can make can make a","start":2491.29,"duration":4.59},{"text":"big deal and this is beyond the hardware","start":2493.75,"duration":3.96},{"text":"improvement this is actual kind of model","start":2495.88,"duration":6.3},{"text":"yep cool and I mean well actually I'm","start":2497.71,"duration":5.76},{"text":"just kind of this is really specific but","start":2502.18,"duration":2.91},{"text":"I'm curious so when you think about like","start":2503.47,"duration":3.72},{"text":"um like hyper parameter searches that's","start":2505.09,"duration":3.81},{"text":"an automat all these things is that's","start":2507.19,"duration":4.05},{"text":"what you do a lot of or does that help","start":2508.9,"duration":3.51},{"text":"you much I mean how do you think about","start":2511.24,"duration":3.24},{"text":"that yeah we we definitely leverage","start":2512.41,"duration":3.96},{"text":"hyper perimeter search and auto ml type","start":2514.48,"duration":4.74},{"text":"capabilities to see what the space is","start":2516.37,"duration":6.05},{"text":"out there and and see how we can

augmentation approaches","start":2534.15,"duration":8.08},{"text":"versus versus model architecture which","start":2537.73,"duration":8.51},{"text":"which do you think is more important","start":2542.23,"duration":4.01},{"text":"[Laughter]","start":2547.9,"duration":10.25},{"text":"research I would agree but I think","start":2553.83,"duration":8.08},{"text":"looking back at what we've actually had","start":2558.15,"duration":8.77},{"text":"to overcome over the last call a year","start":2561.91,"duration":6.69},{"text":"and a half","start":2566.92,"duration":5.22},{"text":"I'd say that data augmentation has been","start":2568.6,"duration":7.68},{"text":"more of a sort of a throttling or a","start":2572.14,"duration":6.21},{"text":"bottleneck to us I'm not sure that that","start":2576.28,"duration":4.53},{"text":"is always going to be the case but","start":2578.35,"duration":4.68},{"text":"specifically it's been a problem for you","start":2580.81,"duration":5.07},{"text":"or it's been helpful to you it's been","start":2583.03,"duration":5.07},{"text":"helpful so it's solved a thing that was","start":2585.88,"duration":4.89},{"text":"a real problem for a bigger problem","start":2588.1,"duration":8.57},{"text":"so the the ability to to understand","start":2590.77,"duration":9.93},{"text":"every environment from day zero right so","start":2596.67,"duration":6.01},{"text":"once the robot starts going around the","start":2600.7,"duration":4.59},{"text":"space a cuz somebody who just bought it","start":2602.68,"duration":5.34},{"text":"they don't want to give that robot a","start":2605.29,"duration":5.67},{"text":"month to get good right there they want","start":2608.02,"duration":4.74},{"text":"if you if you wait a month they're gonna","start":2610.96,"duration":4.23},{"text":"stop using it and then you lose a

solid","start":2618.45,"duration":8.98},{"text":"day zero solution was really the the big","start":2621.69,"duration":8.71},{"text":"important objective for us I think but","start":2627.43,"duration":4.56},{"text":"I'm not sure that that is always going","start":2630.4,"duration":7.36},{"text":"to be the case which is why I think it's","start":2631.99,"duration":8.21},{"text":"[Laughter]","start":2637.76,"duration":4.28},{"text":"change for sure","start":2640.2,"duration":3.82},{"text":"I don't could you say I'm just I've","start":2642.04,"duration":3.24},{"text":"always kind of curious like when you","start":2644.02,"duration":3.33},{"text":"like you're like are you like it do you","start":2645.28,"duration":3.27},{"text":"have you focused on kind of one deep","start":2647.35,"duration":2.43},{"text":"learning framework is that

think","start":2652.3,"duration":3.17},{"text":"about that isn't like all of the above","start":2653.8,"duration":4.92},{"text":"so it depends on the team I think

the","start":2659.95,"duration":4.35},{"text":"modeling team I think they get a little","start":2661.57,"duration":6.33},{"text":"bit more leeway in in experimenting the","start":2664.3,"duration":6.42},{"text":"that's the role right like is the stuff","start":2667.9,"duration":5.76},{"text":"that we've settled on continuing to

that","start":362.01,"duration":4.529},{"text":"maybe we should use a 1d convolution\nmore like text and you can try that","start":366.539,"duration":3.63},{"text":"right because maybe you know each

just copy this model\ncode right into our notebook here and","start":403.87,"duration":9.39},{"text":"now we just have to change the input\nshape to be buckets len and

90%","start":458.08,"duration":11.16},{"text":"accuracy ninety-three ninety-four\npercent accuracy on our test stated it's","start":469.24,"duration":4.709},{"text":"right off the bat which is really cool\nwe've actually taken the machinery that","start":473.949,"duration":2.97},{"text":"we've learned in different domains and\napplied it this totally different domain and","start":476.919,"duration":3.271},{"text":"the same intuition that we had that you\nknow convolutions might work better","start":480.19,"duration":3.029},{"text":"actually turns out to be the case and\nyou might think well if one convolution","start":483.219,"duration":5.641},{"text":"works well what about two convolutions\nso we can take this same thing that we","start":488.86,"duration":5.79},{"text":"did before and take a convolution and a\npooling and then a second convolution and","start":494.65,"duration":4.829},{"text":"a pooling build this model here\ncompile it","start":499.479,"duration":10.461},{"text":"and actually we could go into the go\ninto a project we'd call this one","start":511.55,"duration":7.08},{"text":"perceptron we're gonna call this guy one\nconvolution call this guy two","start":518.63,"duration":11.85},{"text":"convolutions","start":530.48,"duration":3.0},{"text":"so you can see here that our two\nconvolution model is actually slightly","start":549.02,"duration":4.48},{"text":"better than our one convolution model\nwhich is awesome it's like you know","start":553.5,"duration":4.23},{"text":"maybe a 94% accuracy versus a 93%\naccuracy but you know another thing is","start":557.73,"duration":4.41},{"text":"pretty glaring which is that this is the\ntest accuracy and on the training data","start":562.14,"duration":4.53},{"text":"both the one convolution and the two\nconvolution model have 100% accuracy","start":566.67,"duration":3.66},{"text":"right so you know it seems like we have\nan issue with overfitting and again we","start":570.33,"duration":4.38},{"text":"can apply all the intuitions that we\nlearned on text and image data to this","start":574.71,"duration":5.22},{"text":"problem right and so the the clear thing\nto do when you see this the first thing","start":579.93,"duration":2.85},{"text":"to try is to add some dropout so let's\nput a little bit of dropout in our model","start":582.78,"duration":5.76},{"text":"if you put it in the same place that we\ndid before so we can see model add","start":588.54,"duration":3.89},{"text":"dropout maybe dropout 1\/4 the stuff and\ndrop out a quarter of the stuff again compile","start":592.43,"duration":12.28},{"text":"the model and run fit","start":604.71,"duration":3.68},{"text":"and you see that the two convolutions\njust drop out is actually learning","start":619.0,"duration":4.9},{"text":"slower on the training data but it\nactually kind of continues to improve","start":623.9,"duration":5.88},{"text":"and the same thing happens on the test\ndata right so it starts off a little bit","start":629.78,"duration":4.5},{"text":"worse but as it runs over time it gets\nbetter and better and better right so","start":634.28,"duration":4.41},{"text":"this dropout actually allows the model\nto fit the data even a little bit better","start":638.69,"duration":4.17},{"text":"than without the dropouts so all the\nthings that we expect all the theory and","start":642.86,"duration":3.42},{"text":"intuitions that we've learned so far\nthey apply it to audio equally as well","start":646.28,"duration":3.54},{"text":"as images or that which I just think is\nsuper cool maybe let that run a little","start":649.82,"duration":5.37},{"text":"bit then there's one more thing that you\ncan try which we did on text which is we","start":655.19,"duration":5.61},{"text":"could take LSTMs or GRUs and apply\nit to audio right and this might make","start":660.8,"duration":4.23},{"text":"sense especially if we had variable\nlength audio files are much longer audio","start":665.03,"duration":4.56},{"text":"files this might make sense I think\nactually CNNs probably make a little","start":669.59,"duration":2.76},{"text":"more sense for these tiny files where\nthey run well but let's take a peek and","start":672.35,"duration":4.77},{"text":"see how they do so we can copy the code\nfrom our LSTM video","start":677.12,"duration":5.84},{"text":"and so when we copy the code and you see\nthat actually we get an error and it's a","start":724.23,"duration":4.149},{"text":"it's a shape error and it's because LSTM\nexpects a two-dimensional input not a","start":728.379,"duration":4.64},{"text":"three-dimensional input and so you get\nthe scary error message in this case","start":733.019,"duration":3.79},{"text":"though remember we actually added the\nchannel variable later so we could do a","start":736.809,"duration":4.411},{"text":"more complicated reshape but I think the\nsimplest thing to do is just undo the","start":741.22,"duration":6.719},{"text":"reshaping that we did before and then we\ncan try the LSTM","start":747.939,"duration":14.711},{"text":"now the LSTMS","start":762.65,"duration":4.129},{"text":"performance is significantly worse than\nthe convolutions but that might be","start":766.779,"duration":3.81},{"text":"because we had a small LSTM it also could\nbe the fact that our data is actually","start":770.589,"duration":4.83},{"text":"not very long and I think LSTM's would\nmatter more as the data gets much longer","start":775.419,"duration":4.29},{"text":"so we could spend some time really doing\nhyper parameter tuning and maybe get","start":779.709,"duration":4.11},{"text":"this LSTM to the same accuracy as CNNS\nbut I'll just say for these kind of","start":783.819,"duration":3.81},{"text":"short audio files I think you know CNN's\nare gonna be faster train faster and run","start":787.629,"duration":5.73},{"text":"faster and probably the better choice\nbut if we were classifying really long","start":793.359,"duration":4.17},{"text":"conversations that's where LSTMS\nmight really shine I guess my biggest","start":797.529,"duration":4.59},{"text":"point here and we can go deeper in\nsubsequent videos on all types of audio","start":802.119,"duration":3.42},{"text":"processing but the the big point that I\nwant to make is actually the stuff that","start":805.539,"duration":3.27},{"text":"you're learning is really transferable\nacross domains I mean domain expertise","start":808.809,"duration":4.291},{"text":"has a huge role to play here but this\nstuff with CNNS is surprisingly","start":813.1,"duration":5.189},{"text":"transferable in many different areas and\nI think that's just super exciting

4x","start":315.07,"duration":4.74},{"text":"increase in batch size if we call model\ndot fit the first thing you'll notice","start":319.81,"duration":4.35},{"text":"is that it takes a little bit

thing.","start":357.82,"duration":6.44},{"text":"Then we realized, man, we could spend another\ntwo years or three years just trying to build","start":364.26,"duration":4.69},{"text":"the houses

finding out what is a good structure\nfor a house, just one thing and then eventually","start":381.39,"duration":5.38},{"text":"maybe we can merge into projects but then\nStephan actually did a phenomenal job deepening","start":386.77,"duration":6.66},{"text":"our understanding of the literature and economics\nand reached out to other economists and that's","start":393.43,"duration":3.981},{"text":"how we worked with David Parkes in the end,\nfrom Harvard, and really fleshed out how to","start":397.411,"duration":7.219},{"text":"make it work in

the Gini\nindex to go all the way to its maximum either,","start":480.02,"duration":5.26},{"text":"because that means absolutely everybody is\nforced to be 100% equal, which is

out.","start":501.8,"duration":4.61},{"text":"Yeah.","start":506.41,"duration":1.0},{"text":"In fact, I think actually this kind of work\nwill help with that kind of equality

really tough one.","start":564.88,"duration":1.65},{"text":"Now, should it only be productivity times\nequality?","start":566.53,"duration":3.6},{"text":"Maybe not.","start":570.13,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Maybe there should be other things like sustainability\nin there.","start":571.13,"duration":2.77},{"text":"So in the simulation, you have trees.","start":573.9,"duration":3.38},{"text":"The trees will eventually regrow, but you\ncan have a tragedy of the common situation","start":577.28,"duration":5.74},{"text":"where all the agents just get rid of all the\ntrees and then there are no more trees and","start":583.02,"duration":5.2},{"text":"they all optimize their thing.","start":588.22,"duration":1.81},{"text":"Everybody's equal.","start":590.03,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But then, long term, everybody will suffer\nbecause there will be spaces and people won't","start":591.03,"duration":5.02},{"text":"feel anything anymore and it will flatline\nbecause they destroyed all their resources.","start":596.05,"duration":4.4},{"text":"So I think sustainability is a reasonable\none, and then there are interesting

to","start":605.62,"duration":7.47},{"text":"this.","start":613.09,"duration":1.14},{"text":"So you may need to have other protections\nin the objective functions and some boundary","start":614.23,"duration":6.09},{"text":"conditions.","start":620.32,"duration":1.39},{"text":"We could talk about just that for hours, probably,\nand over drinks in the

hoping to realistically,\nthough, is that when a politician in the future","start":634.83,"duration":6.86},{"text":"would say, I want to help the middle class,\nthat's one of the things I want to do.","start":641.69,"duration":5.83},{"text":"And then eventually, either right away during\ntheir campaign or later on, they propose to","start":647.52,"duration":4.54},{"text":"say, now, this is what I'm going to do to\ndo this.","start":652.06,"duration":2.58},{"text":"And then you run that set up through the simulation\nand you say that is really different from","start":654.64,"duration":4.86},{"text":"any of the potential solutions that the simulation\nwould get for helping the middle class.","start":659.5,"duration":5.95},{"text":"Why aren't you...","start":665.45,"duration":1.18},{"text":"Why does yours differ so far?","start":666.63,"duration":2.08},{"text":"What's your thinking about how that will actually\nhelp more than these other ways?","start":668.71,"duration":3.39},{"text":"And so hopefully we can agree more easily\non the objective function and then we can","start":672.1,"duration":5.58},{"text":"disagree less on how to exercise and how to\nget there.","start":677.68,"duration":3.89},{"text":"In your simulation, was there any emergent\nbehavior that surprised you?","start":681.57,"duration":4.4},{"text":"Is there anything counter-intuitive that you\ndiscovered from doing these experiments?","start":685.97,"duration":4.98},{"text":"Yeah, there's definitely some things that\nat first you're like, wait, this doesn't make","start":690.95,"duration":3.8},{"text":"sense.","start":694.75,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So we have taxes and we have subsidies.","start":695.75,"duration":1.51},{"text":"And when you look at it, it's actually the\nlowest income bracket got taxed a lot and","start":697.26,"duration":5.46},{"text":"then it actually went down for this sort of\nmiddle class of the simulation.","start":702.72,"duration":4.31},{"text":"And we're like, wait a minute, that seems\nvery counter-intuitive.","start":707.03,"duration":3.25},{"text":"But it turned out they were also getting more\nsubsidies.","start":710.28,"duration":2.59},{"text":"So they were actually much more positive because\nthe subsidies were also given to that income","start":712.87,"duration":8.64},{"text":"bracket.","start":721.51,"duration":1.43},{"text":"But that at first was kind of counter-intuitive\nbut then once you double clicked on and you","start":722.94,"duration":4.07},{"text":"realize, well, effectively they're actually\ngetting more subsidies than they have to pay","start":727.01,"duration":4.7},{"text":"taxes.","start":731.71,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So it kind of levelled out and made more sense.","start":732.71,"duration":2.51},{"text":"Interesting and sorry, this is I guess maybe\na personal question, but you grew up in eastern","start":735.22,"duration":3.92},{"text":"Germany, didn't you?","start":739.14,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I did for a couple of years.","start":740.14,"duration":1.49},{"text":"Ethiopia for three years and four years or\nso of East Germany and then Germany Reunited.","start":741.63,"duration":6.78},{"text":"I see.","start":748.41,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Do you feel like that gives you a different\nperspective maybe than Americans on these","start":749.41,"duration":3.61},{"text":"topics?","start":753.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I mean, I think I was still pretty young when\nthe Berlin Walls came down.","start":754.02,"duration":6.16},{"text":"So I think, though, culturally, of course,\nEast Germany still had...","start":760.18,"duration":4.2},{"text":"It wasn't like Germany Reunited and then there\nwas like no more differences between East","start":764.38,"duration":3.631},{"text":"and West.","start":768.011,"duration":1.0},{"text":"In fact, some of the issues you see in other\ncountries like you would see between east","start":769.011,"duration":4.679},{"text":"and west, like the east, still has lower income\ncompared to the West, and a lot of women actually","start":773.69,"duration":8.22},{"text":"left East Germany to go to the west.","start":781.91,"duration":3.34},{"text":"So there are a couple of counties that have\nlike too many men and so on.","start":785.25,"duration":4.49},{"text":"So there are still a lot of differences between\nthe east and west still to this day.","start":789.74,"duration":5.2},{"text":"But I think growing up in

affect\nme.","start":800.529,"duration":4.761},{"text":"Like in general as I grew up, it was free\nhealth care and free education all the way","start":805.29,"duration":6.56},{"text":"down to or up to a PhD level, Masters level,\nwas just not ever a politicized question.","start":811.85,"duration":7.35},{"text":"It was just a given and being sort of anti\nbig military intervention was something

them","start":303.21,"duration":3.72},{"text":"anymore.","start":306.93,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So we met in this open co-working space at\nYahoo!; and too many people!","start":307.93,"duration":3.86},{"text":"So everybody wanted to write machine learning\ncode.","start":311.79,"duration":3.47},{"text":"And then we started putting out our first\nmeetups.","start":315.26,"duration":2.01},{"text":"And ever since it has been growing pretty\nfast.","start":317.27,"duration":2.84},{"text":"So we started from very small, but kind of,\nyou know, out of our own need to, because","start":320.11,"duration":5.05},{"text":"in Tokyo there was no such thing back then\nlike two and a half years ago, there were","start":325.16,"duration":3.701},{"text":"a lot of communities like great communities.","start":328.861,"duration":2.879},{"text":"But there was no like place to actually build\nAI, there was no place to work on hands on","start":331.74,"duration":4.8},{"text":"stuffs.","start":336.54,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So that's how it all started.","start":337.54,"duration":1.28},{"text":"That's call you built the community that you\nwanted to be a part of.","start":338.82,"duration":3.9},{"text":"That's so great.","start":342.72,"duration":1.0},{"text":"(smile)Yeah.","start":343.72,"duration":1.0},{"text":"How did you frame it?","start":344.72,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Like when you were first saying, hey, come\njoin me?","start":345.72,"duration":2.24},{"text":"What was that thing to do like it was I got\nto learn ML together or read papers or how","start":347.96,"duration":4.65},{"text":"did you think about that?","start":352.61,"duration":1.98},{"text":"So the very first kind of, I think first six\nmonths or so, it was purely dedicated to going","start":354.59,"duration":6.14},{"text":"through tutorials.","start":360.73,"duration":1.04},{"text":"So really learning about how to write machine\nlearning code and learning about the, you","start":361.77,"duration":4.93},{"text":"know, getting a conceptual understanding of\ndifferent algorithms of the math, but mainly","start":366.7,"duration":5.53},{"text":"to write code.","start":372.23,"duration":1.13},{"text":"And that was how we started.","start":373.36,"duration":1.31},{"text":"It's just, you know, going through as much\nstuff as possible.","start":374.67,"duration":4.03},{"text":"And then once we kind of and, you know, the\nteam grew bigger and more people have joined","start":378.7,"duration":6.65},{"text":"us.","start":385.35,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So, after six months, you kind of slowly started\nto broaden.","start":386.35,"duration":3.49},{"text":"So we did a lot more things.","start":389.84,"duration":1.64},{"text":"We did started doing Hands-On Deep Learning\nworkshops in the first year.","start":391.48,"duration":5.14},{"text":"So, we had deep learning engineers who were\nworking as full time at the Japanese companies","start":396.62,"duration":7.07},{"text":"and they were giving 5(five) hour deep learning\nworkshops where we focus on writing life code","start":403.69,"duration":5.9},{"text":"from scratch and training a specific model\ntraining at in a week.","start":409.59,"duration":4.43},{"text":"We first focused a lot of computer vision.","start":414.02,"duration":2.5},{"text":"So we went through a lot of computer vision\nstuff and then gradually kind of moved into","start":416.52,"duration":4.57},{"text":"different areas of machine learning.","start":421.09,"duration":3.26},{"text":"And like as the community kind of progresses\nand grows, we see that we go into different","start":424.35,"duration":6.47},{"text":"directions.","start":430.82,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So now we have like a computer vision team\nthat does CNN architectures and their own","start":431.82,"duration":4.63},{"text":"little ecosystem.","start":436.45,"duration":1.64},{"text":"We have a team that is fully dedicated to\nAGI, so running deep learning algorithms on","start":438.09,"duration":4.93},{"text":"hardware and micro-controllers and EDGE devices.","start":443.02,"duration":4.1},{"text":"We have a NLP team that does research in natural\nlanguage processing.","start":447.12,"duration":3.28},{"text":"And everything is fully community driven.","start":450.4,"duration":2.49},{"text":"So there is no full time employees or anything.","start":452.89,"duration":2.66},{"text":"It's really how the community evolves and\ngrows and that kind of broadens into different","start":455.55,"duration":5.66},{"text":"directions.","start":461.21,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That's so impressive.","start":462.21,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So like, how do you run a good workshop?","start":463.21,"duration":2.19},{"text":"Like, a five hour workshop?","start":465.4,"duration":1.68},{"text":"You know, I've seen really good ones and bad\nones.","start":467.08,"duration":1.72},{"text":"Like, how would you do it to make sure that\nit a good experience for people?","start":468.8,"duration":4.13},{"text":"I think it was learning by doing then; in\nthe beginning, we really didn't know what","start":472.93,"duration":3.6},{"text":"we were doing.","start":476.53,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I think two years ago, where we held our\nfirst deep learning workshops, a lot of things","start":477.53,"duration":5.19},{"text":"were pretty difficult and pretty challenging\nbecause, you know, people come with different","start":482.72,"duration":5.22},{"text":"machines, with different skill sets, with\ndifferent background knowledge, with different","start":487.94,"duration":4.44},{"text":"software and hardware.","start":492.38,"duration":1.47},{"text":"So that's pretty difficult.","start":493.85,"duration":2.3},{"text":"But, kind of slowly we got a lot of feedback\nin kind of first iterations and worked with","start":496.15,"duration":8.82},{"text":"that feedback.","start":504.97,"duration":1.09},{"text":"So things that made it easier for us is just,\nyou know, focus on one thing that is really","start":506.06,"duration":6.15},{"text":"interesting to us, where we see value that\ncan bring value to us as instructors, as deep","start":512.21,"duration":6.24},{"text":"learning engineers, as well as student communities\nfor something that is very useful.","start":518.45,"duration":5.23},{"text":"The second thing, is like make sure that technically\neverything runs smoothly.","start":523.68,"duration":4.28},{"text":"So we switched, I think after a second or\nthird workshop to Google collapsed.","start":527.96,"duration":5.4},{"text":"That makes it very easy, like to just write\ncode and there is no like prerequisite except","start":533.36,"duration":6.42},{"text":"for having a G-mail account.","start":539.78,"duration":1.69},{"text":"But that solves a lot of the technical issues\nand problems that we had.","start":541.47,"duration":4.98},{"text":"Yeah.","start":546.45,"duration":1.41},{"text":"But does everybody like build the same thing\ntogether, is that how you run it?","start":547.86,"duration":3.91},{"text":"It's like you get your sort of, say, a problem\nthat really works together.","start":551.77,"duration":5.63},{"text":"Like how much do you kind of coordinate like\neverybody doing the exact same thing when","start":557.4,"duration":3.54},{"text":"it's like people going off on their own.","start":560.94,"duration":2.58},{"text":"So it depends what kind of workshop we're\ndoing.","start":563.52,"duration":2.81},{"text":"So if we have our standard deep learning workshop,\nthere's typically a topic and we already have","start":566.33,"duration":5.0},{"text":"prepared like a repository with the model\nthat we're going to build.","start":571.33,"duration":4.36},{"text":"We sit down with 50 people and then the instructor.","start":575.69,"duration":1.86},{"text":"We do some theories.","start":577.55,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So we do first like maybe an hour of conceptual\nunderstanding of what is going to happen,","start":578.55,"duration":4.23},{"text":"where we're going to build.","start":582.78,"duration":1.56},{"text":"And then Demetries, for example, he is like\ncoding from scratch.","start":584.34,"duration":5.46},{"text":"So he basically walks you through from the\nvery beginning to getting your performance","start":589.8,"duration":5.17},{"text":"metrics.","start":594.97,"duration":1.46},{"text":"And so these kind of workshops are designed\nto do exactly this,only this.","start":596.43,"duration":5.39},{"text":"And people just follow along with the code\nand they can life code from scratch.","start":601.82,"duration":3.48},{"text":"And this is something that people find really\nuseful because especially that kind of life","start":605.3,"duration":5.01},{"text":"coding aspect, because sometimes when you're\non your own, you look at, you know, blocks","start":610.31,"duration":5.01},{"text":"of code and you kind of trying to figure out\nwhat is happening.","start":615.32,"duration":3.64},{"text":"Try to figure out your own thing.","start":618.96,"duration":1.91},{"text":"It's useful if someone actually writes code\nwith you and explains what is happening.","start":620.87,"duration":5.55},{"text":"It's you learn just faster probably.","start":626.42,"duration":2.28},{"text":"Or this is at least what I find to be useful.","start":628.7,"duration":3.88},{"text":"On the other hand, we have much more open\nsessions.","start":632.58,"duration":2.33},{"text":"So especially like our hardware sessions where\nwe do AGI, the only thing we provide is a","start":634.91,"duration":6.5},{"text":"ton of hardware and then people come in.","start":641.41,"duration":1.61},{"text":"These are typically smaller groups, maybe\n20-25 people, and then people come in.","start":643.02,"duration":4.95},{"text":"They build teams, they choose their hardware\nand they come up with their own idea and they","start":647.97,"duration":4.81},{"text":"build their own stuff.","start":652.78,"duration":1.06},{"text":"And then at the end of the day, each team\npresents what they have been working on.","start":653.84,"duration":4.58},{"text":"So it really kind of depends on the session,\nI guess.","start":658.42,"duration":2.61},{"text":"Do you think is there like a different kind\nof culture in Japan than, say, in San Francisco?","start":661.03,"duration":5.6},{"text":"Like are language barriers like an issue at\nall?","start":666.63,"duration":2.68},{"text":"What it's like to be sort of?","start":669.31,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I guess, I know what it's like to be in San\nFrancisco, but what do you think that there's","start":670.31,"duration":3.06},{"text":"big differences coming from Japan?","start":673.37,"duration":3.48},{"text":"I don't know San Francisco that well.","start":676.85,"duration":2.07},{"text":"So I was and I went to a lot of meetups actually,\nand they're pretty cool.","start":678.92,"duration":5.02},{"text":"I think a lot more things are just happening\nin San Francisco.","start":683.94,"duration":3.88},{"text":"And I think a lot more things are supported\nprobably in S.F.","start":687.82,"duration":3.78},{"text":"In Japan, language is definitely an issue,\nit's a huge barrier.","start":691.6,"duration":4.28},{"text":"It is something that I've been constantly\nthinking about.","start":695.88,"duration":3.44},{"text":"In Japan, there are amazing communities in\nmachine learning; there are two super big","start":699.32,"duration":5.97},{"text":"machine learning communities, one is TensorFlow\nuser group that is very related, of course,","start":705.29,"duration":5.94},{"text":"like to Google and then Deep Lab, which is\nI think affiliated with Microsoft.","start":711.23,"duration":4.88},{"text":"Those guys are very big and the very, very\nJapanese; so everything is in Japanese.","start":716.11,"duration":6.65},{"text":"And then there's us.","start":722.76,"duration":1.05},{"text":"I think we're like similar in size but we\nspeak in English.","start":723.81,"duration":4.44},{"text":"And yes, this is one thing that has been bothering\nme so much because I'm always trying to find","start":728.25,"duration":6.76},{"text":"ways how to not have these isolated communities.","start":735.01,"duration":4.34},{"text":"So this is a challenge in Japan.","start":739.35,"duration":1.82},{"text":"This is definitely a challenge and we're working\non it.","start":741.17,"duration":2.66},{"text":"But other than that, you see that communities\nare growing and there is a huge demand also","start":743.83,"duration":6.78},{"text":"for a machine learning talent.","start":750.61,"duration":1.46},{"text":"So, yeah, apart from the kind of very Japan\nspecific problems like language barriers,","start":752.07,"duration":5.94},{"text":"I think it's a pretty, pretty good and active\nenvironment to be in.","start":758.01,"duration":4.04},{"text":"Yeah, remember, I went to Japan last year\nand I've worked out on off and on with Japan","start":762.05,"duration":4.99},{"text":"as a market, and I've always been impressed\nby how excited people are about, you know,","start":767.04,"duration":4.301},{"text":"machinery giving going back like 10-15 years\nseem like there's a lot of enthusiasm for","start":771.341,"duration":4.589},{"text":"it.","start":775.93,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And actually, I've been kind of wrestling.","start":776.93,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I just would like to find a way to translate\nour documentation into Japanese and kind of","start":777.93,"duration":4.32},{"text":"keep it up to date.","start":782.25,"duration":1.21},{"text":"Yeah.","start":783.46,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I've been thinking about that lately.","start":784.46,"duration":1.7},{"text":"Yeah, I think that would be a good move.","start":786.16,"duration":2.55},{"text":"We were also like only focusing on English,\nbut there needs to be like this bridge and","start":788.71,"duration":5.68},{"text":"we need to start somewhere.","start":794.39,"duration":1.34},{"text":"So we also started translating.","start":795.73,"duration":2.65},{"text":"We worked with a T.A.(Teaching Assistant)\nfrom Stanford to translate their 'C' as deep","start":798.38,"duration":4.29},{"text":"learning course material, of course notes\ninto Japanese to make it more accessible to","start":802.67,"duration":4.31},{"text":"people and have bilingual kind of resources\nfor people.","start":806.98,"duration":3.63},{"text":"So we're trying also very hard kind of to\ninclude as many people as possible.","start":810.61,"duration":4.57},{"text":"That's awesome.","start":815.18,"duration":1.15},{"text":"What do you think when you think about democratization\nof A.I.?","start":816.33,"duration":4.96},{"text":"I mean, what else do you think","start":821.29,"duration":31.78},{"text":"is important?","start":853.07,"duration":43.77},{"text":"Like","start":896.84,"duration":13.21},{"text":"how do you think about that?","start":910.05,"duration":10.64},{"text":"Maybe, because of my personal background,\nbecause I am a domain expert, but I also see","start":920.69,"duration":7.24},{"text":"how important machine learning is and is going\nto be in the near future.","start":927.93,"duration":5.09},{"text":"I feel like, if possible, we should have as\nmany people as possible involved in even technical","start":933.02,"duration":7.54},{"text":"stuff.","start":940.56,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So there have been a lot of democratization\nefforts, for example, If you look at H2O with","start":941.56,"duration":5.871},{"text":"AutoML, like making it really very easy to\nexperiment, but also of course from other","start":947.431,"duration":6.359},{"text":"AutoML platforms from tech giants.","start":953.79,"duration":2.43},{"text":"For us, it's like a lot of education that\nwe do.","start":956.22,"duration":5.46},{"text":"We work with a lot of universities, something\nthat I kind of personally like doing is working","start":961.68,"duration":5.75},{"text":"with research scientists or students coming\nfrom different backgrounds.","start":967.43,"duration":4.599},{"text":"So I think, machine learning could be super\nuseful for people that work with a lot of","start":972.029,"duration":4.531},{"text":"data.","start":976.56,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And we worked with a lot of super interesting\npeople.","start":977.56,"duration":4.4},{"text":"For example, last year in summer, I think\nwe were at the Tokyo Institute of Technology","start":981.96,"duration":5.129},{"text":"where we held a two day boot camp for Elsie;\nElsie is the Earth Life Sciences Institute.","start":987.089,"duration":5.411},{"text":"And those guys are amazing.","start":992.5,"duration":1.39},{"text":"They are astrophysicists, the planetary sciences\nby all computational biologists, chemists","start":993.89,"duration":6.46},{"text":"like...you know, mind blowing stuff!","start":1000.35,"duration":2.84},{"text":"And we had a room full of people and they\nall work with different kinds of data sets","start":1003.19,"duration":4.87},{"text":"and problem sets and with different tools\nand techniques.","start":1008.06,"duration":3.839},{"text":"And machine learning could be one way for\nthem to get new insights and maybe even to","start":1011.899,"duration":4.101},{"text":"advance science.","start":1016.0,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So, personally for me these kinds of things\nare super exciting, getting like more domain","start":1017.0,"duration":7.22},{"text":"experts involved into technical stuff, doing\nopen education, doing open science; this has","start":1024.22,"duration":6.099},{"text":"been pretty interesting.","start":1030.319,"duration":1.681},{"text":"What about people without math or programming\nbackground?","start":1032.0,"duration":6.57},{"text":"Do you think there's room for them to contribute,\ntoo?","start":1038.57,"duration":2.75},{"text":"Yeah, absolutely.","start":1041.32,"duration":1.33},{"text":"I think so.","start":1042.65,"duration":1.26},{"text":"You know, there are Jeremy Howard and Rachel,\nthey've been doing like the best job ever","start":1043.91,"duration":6.94},{"text":"into getting domain experts on board.","start":1050.85,"duration":3.41},{"text":"Right?","start":1054.26,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You do have to have some coding backgrounds,\nso you should be able to write some python","start":1055.26,"duration":3.81},{"text":"code.","start":1059.07,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But going through fast AI courses, for example,\nit's a more top down approach.","start":1060.07,"duration":5.66},{"text":"And they're exactly democratizing machine\nlearning or making it uncool by having so","start":1065.73,"duration":4.64},{"text":"much more people just involved.","start":1070.37,"duration":2.84},{"text":"And this top down approach allows you to get\ninto deep learning without having to have","start":1073.21,"duration":5.09},{"text":"a PhD at Stanford and computer science or\nlike a really strong math background.","start":1078.3,"duration":6.1},{"text":"You build stuff, so you start with thinking\nabout your problem and your data and to build","start":1084.4,"duration":4.55},{"text":"stuff then afterwards you start digging deeper\ninto the math, for example, that you might","start":1088.95,"duration":7.09},{"text":"need for your particular project or problem.","start":1096.04,"duration":2.95},{"text":"And I think I really like this kind of approach.","start":1098.99,"duration":3.88},{"text":"That's very similar to what we've been doing\nwith MLT as well.","start":1102.87,"duration":4.559},{"text":"Even though we also do a lot of like fundamental\nwork.","start":1107.429,"duration":4.171},{"text":"So we also have like study sessions for machine\nlearning, math and other things.","start":1111.6,"duration":4.04},{"text":"But I think there's definitely room for people\nwho are coming from different backgrounds.","start":1115.64,"duration":5.11},{"text":"And I think if they find it even potentially\nuseful, they should look into it.","start":1120.75,"duration":6.35},{"text":"I mean, you've probably seen people go from\nkind of novices to knowing a lot about ML.","start":1127.1,"duration":7.2},{"text":"And people ask me all the time, how do I get\ninto this stuff?","start":1134.3,"duration":4.73},{"text":"Do you like have any advice from the data\nthat you're saying?","start":1139.03,"duration":2.88},{"text":"And you know what folks should do if you have\nno background and you really want to go deep","start":1141.91,"duration":4.85},{"text":"on this stuff?","start":1146.76,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah, for sure.","start":1147.76,"duration":1.16},{"text":"So I think two things are super important.","start":1148.92,"duration":3.01},{"text":"The first thing is, don't neglect your background,\ndon't think that you have to start over from","start":1151.93,"duration":5.74},{"text":"zero and you don't know anything before that.","start":1157.67,"duration":4.46},{"text":"Leverage your background, leverage your professional\nexperience, your academic background, whatever","start":1162.13,"duration":5.79},{"text":"it is that you have been working on in the\npast years, leverage that.","start":1167.92,"duration":4.29},{"text":"It's the same, there are many examples for\nthat.","start":1172.21,"duration":4.37},{"text":"For example, you could be a hardware engineer\nand you know a lot about hardware; and now","start":1176.58,"duration":4.83},{"text":"you're getting into Machine learning and Deep\nlearning.","start":1181.41,"duration":2.3},{"text":"Now leverage that background and that expertise\nto learn about machine learning and learn","start":1183.71,"duration":5.222},{"text":"how to combine these two things.","start":1188.932,"duration":1.918},{"text":"In my case, it's language.","start":1190.85,"duration":1.62},{"text":"So I've studied language as a system for many,\nmany years and I use machine learning, and","start":1192.47,"duration":5.75},{"text":"the combination of language and machine learning\nto bring interesting and unique insights to","start":1198.22,"duration":7.29},{"text":"particular project that I'm working on.","start":1205.51,"duration":2.5},{"text":"I talked to a recruiter here in Japan and\nI asked him, so what does the market need?","start":1208.01,"duration":4.07},{"text":"And he said, well, it's here in Japan, it's\nnot enough just to know Deep learning.","start":1212.08,"duration":5.14},{"text":"You have to have some sort of specialization,\nyou have to have some sort of domain expertise,","start":1217.22,"duration":5.69},{"text":"some like way how you can use this kind of\nDeep Learning in combination with something","start":1222.91,"duration":5.71},{"text":"else.","start":1228.62,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It could be software engineering, it could\nbe hardware, it could be language, it could","start":1229.62,"duration":2.53},{"text":"be anything.","start":1232.15,"duration":1.47},{"text":"So this is the one thing.","start":1233.62,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And the second thing is when you're coming\nfrom a different background and you want to","start":1234.62,"duration":3.3},{"text":"go into machine learning, there is, of course,\nlike two approaches.","start":1237.92,"duration":4.52},{"text":"Either you start with the fundamentals, you\nstart with math or you do what I just earlier","start":1242.44,"duration":4.64},{"text":"mentioned top down.","start":1247.08,"duration":1.62},{"text":"You start with a project and you just write\ncode, build that project and then figure out","start":1248.7,"duration":4.04},{"text":"details later.","start":1252.74,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And I think the most important thing here\nis to figure out what is interesting to you,","start":1253.74,"duration":5.54},{"text":"what would be something that really catches\nyour attention and you love working on and","start":1259.28,"duration":5.96},{"text":"make that decision and then start working\non that.","start":1265.24,"duration":2.27},{"text":"Because, the problem here is that, there are\ntoo many options.","start":1267.51,"duration":4.65},{"text":"You could do too many things.","start":1272.16,"duration":2.09},{"text":"Everything seems to be interesting.","start":1274.25,"duration":1.59},{"text":"But if you spend a little time here and little\ntime there, you will get maybe some shallow","start":1275.84,"duration":5.24},{"text":"understanding of a few things, but you'll\nnot advance as quickly as you might want.","start":1281.08,"duration":4.29},{"text":"So figure out what you want to do and leverage\nyour backgrounds- probably my advice.","start":1285.37,"duration":5.74},{"text":"Do you think that you see people being more\nsuccessful starting from the fundamentals","start":1291.11,"duration":4.28},{"text":"or starting with a project?","start":1295.39,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Because you mentioned that there's sort of\ntwo different approaches and people gravitate","start":1296.39,"duration":4.0},{"text":"towards one or the other.","start":1300.39,"duration":1.31},{"text":"Do you have a preference or can both work?","start":1301.7,"duration":3.17},{"text":"Both can definitely work.","start":1304.87,"duration":1.58},{"text":"I think we were just like only talking about\ndomain experts and people coming from different","start":1306.45,"duration":6.29},{"text":"backgrounds.","start":1312.74,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But of course, I think what research for the\nacademia and industry needs just as much or","start":1313.74,"duration":7.61},{"text":"even more is people with very, very strong\nCS backgrounds, with very strong math backgrounds","start":1321.35,"duration":5.26},{"text":"that know how to optimize and know how to\nwork on theoretical things.","start":1326.61,"duration":4.63},{"text":"So I'm not saying this is not important, not\nat all.","start":1331.24,"duration":3.15},{"text":"I think, of course, this is still the norm\nand this is what probably employers want to","start":1334.39,"duration":4.61},{"text":"see the most.","start":1339.0,"duration":1.98},{"text":"And if you're coming from a strong cs or math\nbackground, I think you already have a strong","start":1340.98,"duration":5.58},{"text":"foundation to go very deep into machine learning\nand deep learning.","start":1346.56,"duration":4.51},{"text":"But I just want to say, like there's room\nfor other people as well.","start":1351.07,"duration":4.14},{"text":"Ok, so this is a little bit outside of the\nscope maybe of a ML podcast, but I am just","start":1355.21,"duration":4.77},{"text":"fascinated by this, so maybe it is.","start":1359.98,"duration":2.72},{"text":"What about starting a community?","start":1362.7,"duration":1.77},{"text":"Do you have advice on someone in an area like\nyou where they want to find like-minded people?","start":1364.47,"duration":5.02},{"text":"I mean, do you have any advice on that, like\nif I'm in a city where there isn't already","start":1369.49,"duration":5.96},{"text":"like an ML group, how would you go about finding\npeople?","start":1375.45,"duration":2.93},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1378.38,"duration":1.06},{"text":"And like so many people write me messages\non that.","start":1379.44,"duration":3.58},{"text":"Oh, yeah(smile)?","start":1383.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah","start":1384.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That's so great!","start":1385.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"They are either in remote areas or in cities\nwhere like literally something like a machine","start":1386.02,"duration":5.001},{"text":"learning community still doesn't exist.","start":1391.021,"duration":2.299},{"text":"And I would always say like, 'go for it'!","start":1393.32,"duration":4.39},{"text":"If there is no such thing out there, be the\nfirst one to do it.","start":1397.71,"duration":3.34},{"text":"Because, MLT has evolved into an amazing community.","start":1401.05,"duration":3.89},{"text":"Like, literally I'm amazed by how active and\nhow engaged communities and all those guys","start":1404.94,"duration":7.97},{"text":"they have; they have full time jobs, but they\nstill find time to work on open source and","start":1412.91,"duration":6.46},{"text":"to teach other people and to do these kind\nof workshops.","start":1419.37,"duration":3.22},{"text":"So it's pretty amazing.","start":1422.59,"duration":1.459},{"text":"So I would really kind of suggest to think\nabout starting a community wherever you are.","start":1424.049,"duration":4.941},{"text":"Do you have any practice(*) for getting people\noff the ground?","start":1428.99,"duration":2.21},{"text":"Because, it seems kind of daunting to me to\ntry to start that and keep people engaged.","start":1431.2,"duration":4.609},{"text":"How do you get people to keep talking?","start":1435.809,"duration":2.561},{"text":"I think the most important thing is to do\nsomething that you are really interested in,","start":1438.37,"duration":4.09},{"text":"because if you're starting it, a lot of things\nwill depend on you.","start":1442.46,"duration":3.93},{"text":"And the key is, I think somebody wrote it\non Twitter recently; the key also to MLT is","start":1446.39,"duration":4.41},{"text":"consistency.","start":1450.8,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So we consistently just keep doing stuff that\nwe think is exciting and interesting.","start":1451.8,"duration":6.11},{"text":"So start from what you're interested in, start\nfrom your own problem set or from your own","start":1457.91,"duration":6.78},{"text":"need, and more people will follow.","start":1464.69,"duration":3.359},{"text":"And then like more practical things like,\nwe started doing remote meet up so there was","start":1468.049,"duration":8.191},{"text":"no burden of having to find a venue and a\nsponsor and other things.","start":1476.24,"duration":5.99},{"text":"So this is an option how to kick things off\nto find more people who are interested; that","start":1482.23,"duration":5.06},{"text":"makes it very easy, like there is no easier\nway probably then to start like remote meet","start":1487.29,"duration":6.18},{"text":"ups.","start":1493.47,"duration":1.0},{"text":"On the other hand, if you want to start something\nin your city, first of all, you might want","start":1494.47,"duration":6.66},{"text":"form a small peer group around yourself and\ntry to figure out what you want to do and","start":1501.13,"duration":4.41},{"text":"then start to look for a physical place and\nfigure out if you want to do hands on stuff","start":1505.54,"duration":5.32},{"text":"or if you want to do like more educational\nstuff; learn together and try to reach as","start":1510.86,"duration":5.84},{"text":"many people as possible.","start":1516.7,"duration":1.2},{"text":"And, you know, just yesterday I talked to\nsomeone, a journalist, and he said to me,","start":1517.9,"duration":6.149},{"text":"wow, there's no such thing for writers out\nthere.","start":1524.049,"duration":2.491},{"text":"I want to start something for writers out\nthere.","start":1526.54,"duration":2.14},{"text":"And I think it's kind of the same thing.","start":1528.68,"duration":2.17},{"text":"Right?There is a need for all these niche\ngroups and communities.","start":1530.85,"duration":5.1},{"text":"So I think if you get it out there and if\nyou do things that you're very passionate","start":1535.95,"duration":4.74},{"text":"about, people will follow.","start":1540.69,"duration":1.57},{"text":"Do you have any thoughts on like diversity\nand any inclusion in ML in these groups that","start":1542.26,"duration":6.97},{"text":"you create?","start":1549.23,"duration":1.03},{"text":"Is that something that is top of mind for\nyou?","start":1550.26,"duration":2.159},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1552.419,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That's something that is very important to\nus.","start":1553.419,"duration":1.661},{"text":"Luckily within MLT, we're a very diverse kind\nof, four and a half thousand people in terms","start":1555.08,"duration":6.0},{"text":"of countries and languages and skill sets\nand backgrounds and professional experiences.","start":1561.08,"duration":6.07},{"text":"So this is really super diverse.","start":1567.15,"duration":2.14},{"text":"But, yeah, women are super underrepresented.","start":1569.29,"duration":3.44},{"text":"I think two years ago when we started on working\non deep learning workshops, we had 60 engineers","start":1572.73,"duration":6.72},{"text":"and I was the only woman.","start":1579.45,"duration":1.32},{"text":"Wow.","start":1580.77,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah, so I realized we really needed to do\nsomething about that.","start":1581.77,"duration":4.26},{"text":"So we're doing like very specific, not only\nevents but also projects that support diversity","start":1586.03,"duration":6.83},{"text":"and inclusion.","start":1592.86,"duration":1.04},{"text":"We do a lot of women in machine learning events,\nthey are supported by Google Japan, Mercari","start":1593.9,"duration":4.529},{"text":"and other companies.","start":1598.429,"duration":2.671},{"text":"We also do projects that I just earlier mentioned\nwhere in one of them, we had about 12 bilingual","start":1601.1,"duration":6.85},{"text":"engineers that worked on translating some\nof the Stanford course notes into Japanese","start":1607.95,"duration":5.63},{"text":"and having this kind of bilingual resources\nfor people just to be more inclusive in general,","start":1613.58,"duration":5.26},{"text":"also to the Japanese community because we\nare literally in Japan and we are very diverse.","start":1618.84,"duration":5.92},{"text":"But it's still seems like there's a disconnection\nbetween a Japanese community and an English","start":1624.76,"duration":5.65},{"text":"speaking community.","start":1630.41,"duration":1.45},{"text":"And I think it has never been more important.","start":1631.86,"duration":2.569},{"text":"We all know, Tech in general is multidisciplinary\nso machine learning should be as well multidisciplinary.","start":1634.429,"duration":6.771},{"text":"We need people with different skills, with\ndifferent expertise, with different backgrounds","start":1641.2,"duration":6.64},{"text":"in general.","start":1647.84,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So, this is something we all have to work\non, I think.","start":1648.84,"duration":2.87},{"text":"Do you have any other suggestions for making\nthe community feel more inclusive?","start":1651.71,"duration":6.33},{"text":"So in our core team, we decided very early\non that we want to create an environment that","start":1658.04,"duration":9.06},{"text":"is very collaborative and that is very inclusive.","start":1667.1,"duration":3.569},{"text":"That means that we really don't want this\nas kind of elite math machine learning group.","start":1670.669,"duration":9.741},{"text":"We want to include as many people as possible\nand we want to have like decision processes.","start":1680.41,"duration":7.44},{"text":"We want to have the community involved in\nwhat directions we take, what kind of things","start":1687.85,"duration":6.36},{"text":"where we're tackling on next.","start":1694.21,"duration":2.51},{"text":"And every project that we do, in every workshop\nand every study session, we kind of have that","start":1696.72,"duration":7.17},{"text":"sort of mindset.","start":1703.89,"duration":1.07},{"text":"So when you look at our math sessions, like\nlast year we started doing remote math reading","start":1704.96,"duration":5.24},{"text":"sessions.","start":1710.2,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So we're going through a book that walks you\nthrough some machine learning math and more","start":1711.2,"duration":8.12},{"text":"than 1000 people signed up from all over the\nworld.","start":1719.32,"duration":3.099},{"text":"Wow","start":1722.419,"duration":1.0},{"text":"We have sessions in the Bay Area, we have\nsessions in India and Apack here in Japan.","start":1723.419,"duration":6.081},{"text":"And the thing is, it is very inclusive because\nthe sessions, the people that join those sessions,","start":1729.5,"duration":6.669},{"text":"their levels of math are very different; so\nwe have complete beginners, we have people","start":1736.169,"duration":4.75},{"text":"that are coming from completely different\nbackgrounds.","start":1740.919,"duration":2.541},{"text":"But in our Tokyo sessions, we also have mathematicians,\nwe have experts, we have PhD's in math, people","start":1743.46,"duration":6.52},{"text":"that have taught math for many years.","start":1749.98,"duration":2.25},{"text":"And it's pretty amazing, after the reading\nit's a very interactive discussion where people","start":1752.23,"duration":7.0},{"text":"ask all sorts of questions and together we\nkind of brainstorm around things and our experts","start":1759.23,"duration":6.38},{"text":"like Emil and Jason, they try to explain mathematical\nconcepts.","start":1765.61,"duration":4.83},{"text":"And it's been pretty amazing.","start":1770.44,"duration":1.109},{"text":"So I think really having this mindset that\nwhatever you do, you need this.","start":1771.549,"duration":4.791},{"text":"It's something that is actually enriching\nto whatever you do and that is very important","start":1776.34,"duration":5.41},{"text":"and having that mindset is probably going\nto help a lot.","start":1781.75,"duration":3.35},{"text":"Super cool.","start":1785.1,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That sounds really fun.","start":1786.1,"duration":7.079},{"text":"What is something underrated maybe in machine\nlearning that you think people don't pay enough","start":1793.179,"duration":4.25},{"text":"attention to?","start":1797.429,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Something underrated?","start":1798.429,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So, I think something still underrated in\nmachine learning is data.","start":1799.429,"duration":3.961},{"text":"Still?!","start":1803.39,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Oh my God!","start":1804.39,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah, I think so.","start":1805.39,"duration":1.14},{"text":"Like, it doesn't matter who I talk to, always\nI feel like it's a troublesome thing to do.","start":1806.53,"duration":8.06},{"text":"Right.","start":1814.59,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You don't want to work with data, you want\nto write machine learning algorithms, you","start":1815.59,"duration":4.11},{"text":"want to train models, you want to get good\naccuracy and then push accuracy or metric.","start":1819.7,"duration":5.64},{"text":"It's not about data.","start":1825.34,"duration":1.04},{"text":"So data is kind of doilies that people think\nabout sometimes or this is at least kind of","start":1826.38,"duration":5.0},{"text":"my understanding of it.","start":1831.38,"duration":3.771},{"text":"And I think we should definitely think more\nabout data and put more emphasis on data.","start":1835.151,"duration":7.018},{"text":"Maybe this is also because of my own background,\nbecause I've been working with data pretty","start":1842.169,"duration":3.611},{"text":"much all my career and just three years ago\nstarted working with machine learning algorithms.","start":1845.78,"duration":6.74},{"text":"But yeah, it all starts with data and it'll\nprobably ends with data.","start":1852.52,"duration":3.72},{"text":"I think Chip Huyen just mentioned recently,\nwho owns the data pipeline will own the machine","start":1856.24,"duration":5.47},{"text":"learning and production or the machine learning\nsystem.","start":1861.71,"duration":2.23},{"text":"So yeah, I guess; I don't know if it's still\nthat case.","start":1863.94,"duration":3.19},{"text":"Maybe in SF, maybe in the Bay Area people\nthink more about data.","start":1867.13,"duration":3.88},{"text":"I don't know.","start":1871.01,"duration":1.26},{"text":"I don't know.","start":1872.27,"duration":1.25},{"text":"I think my background is similar to yours.","start":1873.52,"duration":2.45},{"text":"And so I feel like data is so unbelievably\nimportant, I guess.","start":1875.97,"duration":3.15},{"text":"Right, Yeah.","start":1879.12,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It's not possible for Data to be properly\nrated for its contribution to ML.","start":1880.12,"duration":5.75},{"text":"And then when you think about making machine\nlearning work in the real world for real applications,","start":1885.87,"duration":5.77},{"text":"what's the hardest part about getting it to\nwork?","start":1891.64,"duration":3.71},{"text":"So in our case, we love to experiment with\nnew things.","start":1895.35,"duration":3.4},{"text":"And I think, it's difficult when you're trying\nnew things, you kind of need to figure out","start":1898.75,"duration":4.4},{"text":"a lot of stuff.","start":1903.15,"duration":2.0},{"text":"And generally, I think in production environments,\nthere is a lot of experimenting and trying","start":1905.15,"duration":6.34},{"text":"to see what works.","start":1911.49,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So making a production pipeline work and deploying\nmachine learning for different use cases has","start":1912.49,"duration":6.54},{"text":"different challenges, from data to all the\nway to software engineering to monitoring","start":1919.03,"duration":7.69},{"text":"your model like how it changes in different\nreal-world scenarios.","start":1926.72,"duration":4.38},{"text":"So even though like things are taking off,\nthere's still a lot of room to work on these","start":1931.1,"duration":8.319},{"text":"kinds of things, infrastructure things, deployment\nthing, finding new use cases, finding use","start":1939.419,"duration":4.231},{"text":"cases that make a lot of sense for machine\nlearning.","start":1943.65,"duration":3.12},{"text":"But at the same time, I think this is super\nexciting, so this is something that really","start":1946.77,"duration":6.31},{"text":"excites me probably the most is thinking about\nuse cases and experimenting a lot and trying","start":1953.08,"duration":7.2},{"text":"new things.","start":1960.28,"duration":2.269},{"text":"At MLT, we do work on production things as\nwell, but it's not our main thing.","start":1962.549,"duration":7.49},{"text":"Our main thing is just trying out new things,\nexperimenting and make POC (Proof of Concept),","start":1970.039,"duration":4.741},{"text":"so we don't actually deploy a lot of things\non a large scale to production.","start":1974.78,"duration":5.85},{"text":"So maybe I can't talk about like the main\nchallenges here, but what I can say is that","start":1980.63,"duration":6.2},{"text":"we try like if we take EDGE, for example,\nwe're trying out a lot of things.","start":1986.83,"duration":6.06},{"text":"We're working with different hardware where\nwe're trying to think about different use","start":1992.89,"duration":3.88},{"text":"cases where these things can be deployed.","start":1996.77,"duration":3.03},{"text":"And there is a lot of things that just don't\nwork out and fail but that's totally fine.","start":1999.8,"duration":6.91},{"text":"That's good as well.","start":2006.71,"duration":1.0},{"text":"This is something that we also need to grow\nand to figure out things.","start":2007.71,"duration":4.01},{"text":"But then at the same time, we also build things\nthat work and that are super interesting.","start":2011.72,"duration":4.36},{"text":"So, yeah, it's a lot of experimenting, I guess.","start":2016.08,"duration":4.079},{"text":"Yeah.","start":2020.159,"duration":1.0},{"text":"OK, so my final question.","start":2021.159,"duration":4.241},{"text":"If listening to you talk I get excited about\njoining one of your virtual ventures, how","start":2025.4,"duration":5.149},{"text":"do I find out more?","start":2030.549,"duration":1.141},{"text":"How do I get more involved with MLT?","start":2031.69,"duration":2.2},{"text":"Can I do that remotely?","start":2033.89,"duration":1.61},{"text":"Yes, you can, definitely.","start":2035.5,"duration":2.03},{"text":"So we do, as I mentioned earlier, like on\nMeetup, you can find all of our events and","start":2037.53,"duration":4.8},{"text":"a lot of them are actually remote.","start":2042.33,"duration":2.77},{"text":"So if you want to be part of an event or a\nmeetup or something like that, you can just","start":2045.1,"duration":6.229},{"text":"join meetup and we will post everything there.","start":2051.329,"duration":2.67},{"text":"There's also more active things.","start":2053.999,"duration":1.62},{"text":"So if you would like to work on open source\nor doing some other things or get more involved","start":2055.619,"duration":6.13},{"text":"in general, you can join our slack group.","start":2061.749,"duration":3.03},{"text":"There is pretty much the whole community,\nthey are talking about different things, so","start":2064.779,"duration":3.981},{"text":"probably more in technical depth.","start":2068.76,"duration":1.659},{"text":"So you can also find people there to work\non projects and do other things.","start":2070.419,"duration":4.67},{"text":"And so these are kind of the main two things,\nthe meet up for events and maybe slack for","start":2075.089,"duration":4.81},{"text":"projects and other stuff.","start":2079.899,"duration":1.641},{"text":"Awesome.","start":2081.54,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Thank you so much.","start":2082.54,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It's great to talk with

about\nthe data part of that infrastructure, teams","start":373.73,"duration":9.189},{"text":"that think about the compute part of the infrastructure\nand then we also have to think about

there's a whole lot of\nother testing that needs to happen in between.","start":400.919,"duration":4.341},{"text":"Simulation is one example where you try to\nrun the software that you built, that will","start":405.26,"duration":6.35},{"text":"eventually run your car, somewhere in the\ncloud.","start":411.61,"duration":2.97},{"text":"And then we also have rigs that we build;\nwe call them test

tests.","start":434.23,"duration":1.35},{"text":"So there are different types of these testbuilds\nthat we build and you can think of them as","start":435.58,"duration":5.72},{"text":"mini data

cloud.","start":447.52,"duration":3.99},{"text":"So we have teams that do all of that and then\nthere's teams that work on simulation....","start":451.51,"duration":5.34},{"text":"All of these teams eventually come together\nat the end of the day.","start":456.85,"duration":3.01},{"text":"It all gets packaged up into software that\nis the part of the code in the car and then","start":459.86,"duration":4.91},{"text":"we test the car on the road, and then there\nare metrics used to drive work on the software","start":464.77,"duration":7.28},{"text":"that runs on the

hour.","start":475.79,"duration":4.379},{"text":"That means you may have to potentially replan\nyour storage capacity.","start":480.169,"duration":6.75},{"text":"Things like that.","start":486.919,"duration":1.5},{"text":"Did I answer your question?","start":488.419,"duration":2.491},{"text":"There are so many more questions actually.","start":490.91,"duration":3.5},{"text":"I think you're at the point where you probably\nhave some metric like how long you can drive","start":494.41,"duration":8.11},{"text":"without intervention that you're trying to\noptimize for something like that.","start":502.52,"duration":4.77},{"text":"But then do you break it down by teams of\nlike, \"we need to make our perception 10%","start":507.29,"duration":5.7},{"text":"better\", or something like that?","start":512.99,"duration":1.45},{"text":"How do you think about that?","start":514.44,"duration":3.05},{"text":"It's kind of broken down, right?","start":517.49,"duration":2.62},{"text":"For example, there's a top-level metric for\nthe world system performance and then...","start":520.11,"duration":5.88},{"text":"Is it like time between intervention?","start":525.99,"duration":1.7},{"text":"Is that the right metric to look at?","start":527.69,"duration":2.49},{"text":"California DMV reporting that that's what\nthey look at.","start":530.18,"duration":3.07},{"text":"So they look at what's called MPI, Miles Per\nIntervention; how many miles do you drive","start":533.25,"duration":5.52},{"text":"before you have an intervention?","start":538.77,"duration":1.97},{"text":"It's a really common metric that people track\nbut then there are so many other metrics that","start":540.74,"duration":5.78},{"text":"you have to think about.","start":546.52,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Like the endpoint latency is one example.","start":547.52,"duration":1.77},{"text":"How long does it take from, say, the time\nyou your camera captured a frame to the time","start":549.29,"duration":5.59},{"text":"that you reacted to it?","start":554.88,"duration":3.06},{"text":"So there's a number of other metrics that\nmatter but of course, you can argue that all","start":557.94,"duration":4.3},{"text":"of them come down into an intervention like\nsome human had to intervene.","start":562.24,"duration":5.5},{"text":"That's kind of how generally the industry\nis standardized around today but, you know,","start":567.74,"duration":4.26},{"text":"it's really controversial because what is\nan intervention?","start":572.0,"duration":2.14},{"text":"How do you report it?","start":574.14,"duration":3.77},{"text":"It's up for debate.","start":577.91,"duration":1.46},{"text":"But then internally we track a number of other\nbroader system level metrics and you can do","start":579.37,"duration":6.68},{"text":"two things.","start":586.05,"duration":1.0},{"text":"One is you can apportion.","start":587.05,"duration":1.729},{"text":"Let's say you do MPI, the Miles Per Intervention,\nyou could apportion MPI to different components","start":588.779,"duration":7.591},{"text":"and say, \"hey, the reason the intervention\nhappened was because we misperceived, the","start":596.37,"duration":3.35},{"text":"reason the intervention happened was because\nour map was wrong.\"","start":599.72,"duration":2.53},{"text":"And apportion those.","start":602.25,"duration":2.12},{"text":"And they can go round as far as they can go\nround.","start":604.37,"duration":3.57},{"text":"That's it.","start":607.94,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But then really, that's just only part of\nthe problem.","start":608.94,"duration":2.98},{"text":"So each component will also have its own separate\nmetric.","start":611.92,"duration":4.16},{"text":"Perception, for example, we may want to track\nthe position and recall of seeing different","start":616.08,"duration":7.75},{"text":"agents.","start":623.83,"duration":2.07},{"text":"What's the position recall for seeing a pedestrian\nor a car or a bus?","start":625.9,"duration":5.01},{"text":"And then you can follow something like that.","start":630.91,"duration":2.42},{"text":"How good is my perception\/recall at 50 meters?","start":633.33,"duration":5.05},{"text":"100 meters?","start":638.38,"duration":2.12},{"text":"500 meters?","start":640.5,"duration":2.12},{"text":"So there's lots and lots of metrics that eventually\nbreak down at the component level where it","start":642.62,"duration":5.24},{"text":"comes down to every component.","start":647.86,"duration":2.62},{"text":"How do you allocate your resources?","start":650.48,"duration":1.62},{"text":"Is the perception team a lot bigger than the\nplanning team?","start":652.1,"duration":3.24},{"text":"That's a very good question.","start":655.34,"duration":3.53},{"text":"I'd say it's \nroughly similar between the two teams.","start":658.87,"duration":9.75},{"text":"I don't think that there's a perfect science\nwhen you want to allocate resources.","start":668.62,"duration":4.18},{"text":"You kinda have to look at the stage of the\nproject you are in and the majority...","start":672.8,"duration":5.15},{"text":"Because sometimes each project, each arc of\nthe stack will move at different paces depending","start":677.95,"duration":7.09},{"text":"upon what they're building.","start":685.04,"duration":1.7},{"text":"So let's say you're doing something which\nis highly machine-learning-dependent, I'm","start":686.74,"duration":4.66},{"text":"talking about when you're starting from scratch.","start":691.4,"duration":4.25},{"text":"Steady state, of course, is very different.","start":695.65,"duration":1.92},{"text":"When you're starting from scratch, when you're\nbeginning, you first may have to spend quite","start":697.57,"duration":6.11},{"text":"a bit of time building your machine learning\ninfrastructure, data gathering, all of that.","start":703.68,"duration":4.32},{"text":"So those teams you probably want to populate\nfirst before you start throwing models at","start":708.0,"duration":4.27},{"text":"it.","start":712.27,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Maybe you can get away with a relatively rudimentary\nteam, a smaller team of just a few code experts","start":713.27,"duration":6.31},{"text":"in the perception part.","start":719.58,"duration":2.51},{"text":"And then once that is ready, then you start\nputting more people in that area and maybe","start":722.09,"duration":5.97},{"text":"you don't have to work so hard to throw additional\npeople on the infrastructure side of things.","start":728.06,"duration":5.91},{"text":"Once you start unlocking the ability to see\nthe world, then you can start doing more and","start":733.97,"duration":4.809},{"text":"more complicated maneuvers and planning and\nthen you start pushing more into the planning","start":738.779,"duration":4.651},{"text":"world; and then you start hitting bottlenecks\non that side and then you will kind of say,","start":743.43,"duration":3.969},{"text":"\"oh, yeah, I should look at adding few more\npeople to unlock this thing in that area.\"","start":747.399,"duration":5.931},{"text":"It kind of is very, very dynamic so I wouldn't\nsay there's one standard formula through which","start":753.33,"duration":5.03},{"text":"we do resource allocation here.","start":758.36,"duration":2.53},{"text":"I see.","start":760.89,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But is it like where you're seeing the most\nactually interventions being caused by, or","start":761.89,"duration":4.62},{"text":"is it where you see the most opportunity for\nimprovement?","start":766.51,"duration":3.83},{"text":"I think interventions in a steady state world,\nlet's say that a lot of bugs ignored interventions.","start":770.34,"duration":7.62},{"text":"I mean, if you just replace interventions\nwith bugs.","start":777.96,"duration":3.74},{"text":"It's the same problem in any software; like\nrarely have you biggeest bugs.","start":781.7,"duration":3.97},{"text":"And sometimes throwing more people at the\nproblem is the right answer.","start":785.67,"duration":3.39},{"text":"And sometimes it is not the right answer.","start":789.06,"duration":1.36},{"text":"In fact, it's the wrong answer.","start":790.42,"duration":1.919},{"text":"So you may want to figure out putting the\nright people into that.","start":792.339,"duration":3.521},{"text":"Maybe you don't have the right expertise.","start":795.86,"duration":1.82},{"text":"So it's not always clear that the resource\nallocation is directly proportional to the","start":797.68,"duration":5.54},{"text":"number of bugs that you have.","start":803.22,"duration":2.22},{"text":"I see.","start":805.44,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That makes sense.","start":806.44,"duration":1.28},{"text":"At this moment, is there a particular part\nof the chain that feels like the most challenging","start":807.72,"duration":4.369},{"text":"for you, that feels like there's the most\nroom to improve?","start":812.089,"duration":2.961},{"text":"I think that if you look at the state of understanding\nand state of research in this space, the place","start":815.05,"duration":9.86},{"text":"where there is a lot of scope for improvement\nis in the area of prediction and say, behavior","start":824.91,"duration":7.36},{"text":"planning.","start":832.27,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So there's an area where there's still a lot\nof active development going

team.","start":838.72,"duration":5.62},{"text":"So there's a lot of activity going on in that\nwork.","start":844.34,"duration":3.749},{"text":"So I would say thats an area, which is developing\nquite a bit.","start":848.089,"duration":2.411},{"text":"So this is like predicting where another car\nis going to go whether at a pedestrian...?","start":850.5,"duration":4.48},{"text":"What will happen in

problems.","start":864.35,"duration":2.63},{"text":"So inside of the car when it's when it's operating\nright now, how many different models are

updated?","start":965.75,"duration":2.99},{"text":"It completely depends on which one you're\ntalking about.","start":968.74,"duration":8.659},{"text":"So if you're doing the mapping ones that's\nreally dependent on why you're using the model.","start":977.399,"duration":7.641},{"text":"So sometimes, these models are used to help\nthe operators as they work on the new UI techniques","start":985.04,"duration":10.0},{"text":"or whatever where there's some additional\nassist they're providing.","start":995.04,"duration":2.44},{"text":"They made update it when that time comes.","start":997.48,"duration":3.549},{"text":"Otherwise, generally they're assisting humans\nas opposed to doing it on their own.","start":1001.029,"duration":7.601},{"text":"So those models don't update us frequently.","start":1008.63,"duration":1.87},{"text":"But the models that are operating on the card,\nyou do that depending on what you're addressing","start":1010.5,"duration":10.55},{"text":"and which area that you're trying to improve.","start":1021.05,"duration":2.789},{"text":"So let's say you're working in winter and\nyou see a lot of vapour or smoke much more","start":1023.839,"duration":8.571},{"text":"visible, there'll be some parts of the code\nthat are more impacted by all of that.","start":1032.41,"duration":4.65},{"text":"So you'll see those iterating very fast.","start":1037.06,"duration":2.62},{"text":"In general, though, these models tend to get\ntrained and iterated upon on almost a continuous","start":1039.68,"duration":6.72},{"text":"basis like the ones which go on the car.","start":1046.4,"duration":5.23},{"text":"Did these models feed into each

don't","start":1074.899,"duration":4.071},{"text":"know the specific details about how the team\nmanages it, but I don't think that they have","start":1078.97,"duration":6.17},{"text":"to go and retrain their downstream models.","start":1085.14,"duration":1.83},{"text":"But maybe you can think about it as you have\nyour model metrics, right?","start":1086.97,"duration":4.04},{"text":"So you train your model.","start":1091.01,"duration":1.08},{"text":"You get a bunch of metrics around the model.","start":1092.09,"duration":2.57},{"text":"But that's not enough.","start":1094.66,"duration":1.07},{"text":"So you have to look at downstream metrics\nalso.","start":1095.73,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Because quite often, those tend to be the\ntrickiest bugs also.","start":1099.01,"duration":3.08},{"text":"So you bring your model, it all looks good\nin terms of the metrics and it's all working","start":1102.09,"duration":4.73},{"text":"fine.","start":1106.82,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You deploy it in the car and then you see\nthe behaviors change quite a bit.","start":1107.82,"duration":3.9},{"text":"The car may decide to break more often, or\ndo something different.","start":1111.72,"duration":5.0},{"text":"And then you have to debug that because the\nmodel behavior has impacted something downstream.","start":1116.72,"duration":5.74},{"text":"So then you have to debug that.","start":1122.46,"duration":2.839},{"text":"So it's not necessarily that you have to retrain\nthose downstream models, you may just want","start":1125.299,"duration":5.551},{"text":"to figure out where the interaction is happening.","start":1130.85,"duration":3.6},{"text":"There are a number of few things you do have\nto be very careful about though.","start":1134.45,"duration":3.1},{"text":"Like the validation search that you'd use\nto validate this model and the training set","start":1137.55,"duration":6.53},{"text":"that you'd use for the training downstream.","start":1144.08,"duration":1.62},{"text":"You have to be very careful of keeping them\nall separated and hopefully there's no overlap.","start":1145.7,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Otherwise, you may introduce some of your\nartifacts.","start":1151.54,"duration":3.47},{"text":"So those things the team has to be very careful\nabout.","start":1155.01,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Do you think it's harder with these kinds\nof models?","start":1158.51,"duration":3.23},{"text":"A lot of people have talked about like predicting\ntimelines is much more difficult.","start":1161.74,"duration":4.309},{"text":"Have you

improvements.","start":1170.29,"duration":1.22},{"text":"I feel like software's already hard, right?","start":1171.51,"duration":2.96},{"text":"But with the models, it almost seems like\nit might be

10% improvement on","start":1182.6,"duration":5.16},{"text":"this accuracy metric\"?","start":1187.76,"duration":3.799},{"text":"They set themselves goals for improving it.","start":1191.559,"duration":4.171},{"text":"I think ultimately it's the same with any\nsoftware.","start":1195.73,"duration":3.18},{"text":"You set yourself a goal.","start":1198.91,"duration":1.759},{"text":"But just because it's machine learning doesn't\nmean that it's a new problem.","start":1200.669,"duration":4.971},{"text":"The problem has got to do with the fact that\nyou really don't know the perfect solution","start":1205.64,"duration":5.12},{"text":"and you can't really estimate what it'll take\nfor you to get to the perfect solution.","start":1210.76,"duration":4.64},{"text":"So the way you do that is by series of experiments,\nby iteration.","start":1215.4,"duration":6.19},{"text":"Because if you know exactly what to write,\nthen why wouldn't you pretty accurately estimate","start":1221.59,"duration":4.45},{"text":"the time?","start":1226.04,"duration":1.22},{"text":"And sometimes that's the case like in say\nyou say, \"oh, I need to know refactor this","start":1227.26,"duration":7.12},{"text":"thought.\"","start":1234.38,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You know roughly how long it would take and\nyou have test cases around, you can test it","start":1235.38,"duration":3.09},{"text":"so you know all your unknown unknowns, all\nof those things that people get off.","start":1238.47,"duration":4.6},{"text":"So you become more and more predictable over\ntime.","start":1243.07,"duration":2.39},{"text":"That's basically what I'm trying to say.","start":1245.46,"duration":2.339},{"text":"Basically, what happens is that as you keep\nworking on the problem, you start having a","start":1247.799,"duration":5.441},{"text":"better idea about how long it will take because\nyou start developing intuition about that","start":1253.24,"duration":7.68},{"text":"particular area.","start":1260.92,"duration":3.68},{"text":"Then you probably have unit test sort like\nintegration tests and some other tests that","start":1264.6,"duration":4.81},{"text":"help you guide and focus on the right areas\nand carve out the noise.","start":1269.41,"duration":5.98},{"text":"Then you tend to get a lot more predictable\nin the work that you do.","start":1275.39,"duration":6.57},{"text":"Then after that, if you change your model,\nyou come in with a new model, you know how","start":1281.96,"duration":5.579},{"text":"many experiments you need to run.","start":1287.539,"duration":1.611},{"text":"You know how to scale.","start":1289.15,"duration":1.75},{"text":"Then at a point, it's like throwing money\nat the problem.","start":1290.9,"duration":2.59},{"text":"You paralyze it and you do a lot more work.","start":1293.49,"duration":6.9},{"text":"But you are getting more and more predictable\njust because you've built all those intuition","start":1300.39,"duration":4.66},{"text":"and all those collateral through tests so\nI would say that, going back to your question,","start":1305.05,"duration":5.89},{"text":"are they predictable?","start":1310.94,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Definitely not that I would say.","start":1311.94,"duration":2.25},{"text":"But as they start working on it, they get\nbetter and better and more accurate about","start":1314.19,"duration":4.32},{"text":"it in terms of how much they can do.","start":1318.51,"duration":1.26},{"text":"And this isn't predicting improvements, like\nincremental improvements.","start":1319.77,"duration":4.46},{"text":"I would say more like let's say they're trying\nto fix issues because they tend to get like","start":1324.23,"duration":9.26},{"text":"more and more predictable about that.","start":1333.49,"duration":2.79},{"text":"Now, they're bringing in they say like, \"oh,\nthe circumstances with the goal of saying","start":1336.28,"duration":3.37},{"text":"I'm going to improve it by X% improvement.\"","start":1339.65,"duration":4.97},{"text":"So the best way they can do that is by running\na whole bunch of experiments and see how fast","start":1344.62,"duration":4.97},{"text":"they can come.","start":1349.59,"duration":1.53},{"text":"Even that, if your infrastructure is better\nand you have a good set of personnel that","start":1351.12,"duration":5.73},{"text":"you can get incrementally better but I don't\nthink that it's any different than any other","start":1356.85,"duration":3.59},{"text":"software development that you can get super\npredictable.","start":1360.44,"duration":2.75},{"text":"I guess one question or one thing that some\npeople say is different, or that I imagine","start":1363.19,"duration":4.402},{"text":"is different is testing these models.","start":1367.592,"duration":4.418},{"text":"Before you put them into production, do you\ntest them against a set of unit tests where","start":1372.01,"duration":5.049},{"text":"it's, \"I insist that the model does this or\nthat the car does this in this situation?\"","start":1377.059,"duration":5.231},{"text":"Or is it more like an overall accuracy of\nI want it to make the right decision 99% of","start":1382.29,"duration":7.129},{"text":"the time.","start":1389.419,"duration":1.201},{"text":"How do you think about that?","start":1390.62,"duration":3.0},{"text":"Because aren't these models somewhat inherently\nunpredictable or they're not always going","start":1393.62,"duration":5.88},{"text":"to do exactly the same thing, right?","start":1399.5,"duration":2.47},{"text":"Right.","start":1401.97,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So the way it works is that you have a model\nand you will have a certain...","start":1402.97,"duration":6.92},{"text":"I'm talking in terms of Perception models\nbecause if you're doing something else downstream","start":1409.89,"duration":5.83},{"text":"in the area of planning, it's pretty different.","start":1415.72,"duration":3.38},{"text":"So you will have certain metrics that you\nreached today.","start":1419.1,"duration":6.56},{"text":"Then what you will do is obviously you're\nworking to go beyond that metric, right?","start":1425.66,"duration":9.009},{"text":"You can identify that as part of your model\ndevelopment.","start":1434.669,"duration":2.771},{"text":"Like you'll develop it, you'll have the model\nresults.","start":1437.44,"duration":3.62},{"text":"But that's not enough.","start":1441.06,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So you then have to do some level of integration\ntesting.","start":1442.06,"duration":5.109},{"text":"You put it all together and then you see,\nlike, \"how's the downstream metric?\"","start":1447.169,"duration":4.481},{"text":"Let's say if it's perception.","start":1451.65,"duration":3.04},{"text":"The output of perception that really planning\nwould consume is what we call Tracks.","start":1454.69,"duration":5.18},{"text":"These are basically objects over time that\nyou track over time.","start":1459.87,"duration":4.669},{"text":"So you have to get those tracking metrics\nimproved or better or impacted in one way","start":1464.539,"duration":5.591},{"text":"or another in those areas.","start":1470.13,"duration":3.15},{"text":"And then when you put that in the car, then\nthe top level metrics that you have, like,","start":1473.28,"duration":6.62},{"text":"how's the car behaving, whether it is driving,\nis it comfortable?","start":1479.9,"duration":5.86},{"text":"Is it safe?","start":1485.76,"duration":1.09},{"text":"So what are the metrics that you track for\nany of those things?","start":1486.85,"duration":4.48},{"text":"So you have to get that right.","start":1491.33,"duration":1.45},{"text":"So you have to go through this entire journey\nrepeatedly.","start":1492.78,"duration":2.92},{"text":"It's not you just run the model once and it\nworks.","start":1495.7,"duration":5.53},{"text":"And are you able to run these tests every\ntime there's a new model, as you try to pass","start":1501.23,"duration":5.0},{"text":"the first test and then sort of expand out?","start":1506.23,"duration":3.02},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1509.25,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You have to run through the entire gamut if\nyou're doing something brand new.","start":1510.25,"duration":2.99},{"text":"Do you have any interesting examples of something\nthat improved the local tests but made that","start":1513.24,"duration":7.21},{"text":"the test worse?","start":1520.45,"duration":1.45},{"text":"Yeah, yeah.","start":1521.9,"duration":1.0},{"text":"There's a bunch of examples.","start":1522.9,"duration":1.0},{"text":"The thing is, I don't know what I can tell\nyou.","start":1523.9,"duration":5.54},{"text":"Fair enough.","start":1529.44,"duration":1.02},{"text":"I mean, there are all these cases where you'll\nsee the interaction between the model you","start":1530.46,"duration":6.99},{"text":"see upstream, the perception and what happens\non the planning side.","start":1537.45,"duration":5.04},{"text":"I mean, I can tell you as a friend but maybe\nI shouldn't put it out there on the clip.","start":1542.49,"duration":5.31},{"text":"But anyways, I was just giving you an example\nof winter; you have a lot more smoke that","start":1547.8,"duration":11.9},{"text":"you have to deal with.","start":1559.7,"duration":2.2},{"text":"We could see that the model performance is\nreally good but when we integrated it, it","start":1561.9,"duration":4.48},{"text":"didn't work right.","start":1566.38,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And so we had to go back and see if there\nwas some interaction going on between the","start":1567.38,"duration":6.12},{"text":"upstream model and the downstream model that\ncaused this problem.","start":1573.5,"duration":2.72},{"text":"These kind of things happen all the time.","start":1576.22,"duration":3.64},{"text":"So the team over time has become much more\nrigorous about all these things.","start":1579.86,"duration":3.689},{"text":"So any time they do this, there's a lot of\nautomation built in.","start":1583.549,"duration":3.341},{"text":"They test all these things.","start":1586.89,"duration":5.19},{"text":"So they have to go through the whole thing.","start":1592.08,"duration":3.14},{"text":"I see.","start":1595.22,"duration":1.39},{"text":"When you see teams improve models, is it typically\nthat they've collected more different data,","start":1596.61,"duration":9.33},{"text":"changed the data pipeline or improved the\nmodel itself?","start":1605.94,"duration":4.25},{"text":"Do you have a sense of what...?","start":1610.19,"duration":2.8},{"text":"Most often you feel like the improvements\nhappen with the right data.","start":1612.99,"duration":4.83},{"text":"Interesting, the right data.","start":1617.82,"duration":3.57},{"text":"It's less often that the model architecture\nitself has to be changed.","start":1621.39,"duration":2.87},{"text":"Got it.","start":1624.26,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1625.26,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But is it that it's the MLT themselves that's\nasking for different types of datasets?","start":1626.26,"duration":4.57},{"text":"Do they control that process, or is there\na data team?","start":1630.83,"duration":5.17},{"text":"OK, so this is another big thing that we've\nbeen somewhat religious about it, level 5.","start":1636.0,"duration":7.21},{"text":"We don't have a notion of an engineering team,\na science team or a data team.","start":1643.21,"duration":4.37},{"text":"We just have a perception team.","start":1647.58,"duration":3.56},{"text":"I'll tell you my mental model around ML.","start":1651.14,"duration":5.05},{"text":"I think ML is a skill.","start":1656.19,"duration":3.339},{"text":"It's like anything you learn.. you know how\nto write python, great.","start":1659.529,"duration":3.061},{"text":"Or you know how to write C++, that's a skill.","start":1662.59,"duration":2.72},{"text":"So ML is a skill but a skill alone is not\nenough.","start":1665.31,"duration":3.44},{"text":"So you need domain expertise.","start":1668.75,"duration":2.179},{"text":"So just because you know how to write Python\nmay be good enough for some things, but if","start":1670.929,"duration":5.471},{"text":"you're trying to build some complex insurance\nthing, you probably need to understand insurance.","start":1676.4,"duration":5.95},{"text":"So how do you divide the domain knowledge\nfrom the skill?","start":1682.35,"duration":6.02},{"text":"In some cases you can't.","start":1688.37,"duration":1.52},{"text":"And you see that happening like so you'll\nhave EMs write a spec and then they'll give","start":1689.89,"duration":3.27},{"text":"you something and say, go and implement it.","start":1693.16,"duration":4.35},{"text":"More often you'll see that the engineer has\nto really ramp up and truly understand what","start":1697.51,"duration":4.049},{"text":"the actual problem is because they would debug\nsomething and they have to really understand","start":1701.559,"duration":5.081},{"text":"what is going on.","start":1706.64,"duration":1.05},{"text":"It's the same thing in ML.","start":1707.69,"duration":1.02},{"text":"So we have a team that is called the prediction\nteam, their job is to predict.","start":1708.71,"duration":7.64},{"text":"So we don't have a difference between some\ndata scientist or a data team and an engineer.","start":1716.35,"duration":4.9},{"text":"So it's the same people who have the domain\nexpertise and have ML skills.","start":1721.25,"duration":5.99},{"text":"And that's how we've been operating so far.","start":1727.24,"duration":2.22},{"text":"That's cool.","start":1729.46,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So all of your teams have a mix of skillsets.","start":1730.46,"duration":3.47},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1733.93,"duration":1.19},{"text":"So this seems to be a pretty big debate in\nthe industry, you know, should we have a science","start":1735.12,"duration":9.09},{"text":"and an engineering team idea.","start":1744.21,"duration":2.81},{"text":"So the mental model I've come up with is Job\nof our Science; is to develop knowledge, the","start":1747.02,"duration":5.149},{"text":"art of what they produce, the production is\nknowledge and the job of an engineering team","start":1752.169,"duration":6.211},{"text":"is an artifact.","start":1758.38,"duration":1.01},{"text":"In most cases, we are actually building an\nartifact.","start":1759.39,"duration":4.49},{"text":"We are building a product.","start":1763.88,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So in each case I see that the science vs\nengineering divide to be less

asked..","start":1812.331,"duration":2.149},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1814.48,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So if you are a domain specialist, you already\nhave a very good intuition about what is

interesting.","start":2267.77,"duration":1.249},{"text":"There are teams which were nonexistent and\nthen they've been built and then now they've","start":2269.019,"duration":8.57},{"text":"gotten to

scale.","start":2279.049,"duration":3.81},{"text":"But then there are still some new teams that\nare forming and it almost feels like they're","start":2282.859,"duration":4.911},{"text":"doing things

few things happened.","start":2302.16,"duration":1.06},{"text":"One is as you get bigger and operate on a\nwider scale...","start":2303.22,"duration":4.5},{"text":"In the beginning, we would not care

be","start":2316.779,"duration":4.951},{"text":"like that.","start":2321.73,"duration":1.0},{"text":"As the team started growing, more engineers\nstarted coming in and the reproducibility","start":2322.73,"duration":5.26},{"text":"and all of that started becoming a real problem\nbecause multiple people are working on the","start":2327.99,"duration":3.609},{"text":"same thing.","start":2331.599,"duration":1.19},{"text":"And so then you start becoming much more rigorous\nin your process, and that's fine.","start":2332.789,"duration":4.71},{"text":"But it would work only if you have maybe four\nof them working together.","start":2337.499,"duration":5.441},{"text":"But once you go beyond that, process won't\nfix it, mutual agreements won't fix it.","start":2342.94,"duration":6.929},{"text":"So you probably should be building a framework\nto help you standardize that process and just","start":2349.869,"duration":5.49},{"text":"make you not worry about all the moving parts.","start":2355.359,"duration":3.01},{"text":"Then after that, you'll find that the framework\ndoesn't last you and then you'll write a

that.","start":2367.489,"duration":2.5},{"text":"Then another thing that will happen is as\nyou ramp up and you grow that much, you'll","start":2369.989,"duration":5.04},{"text":"start becoming

things.","start":2419.609,"duration":3.51},{"text":"And then you start getting even more electro-track\nall your experiment, and then you begin to","start":2423.119,"duration":4.091},{"text":"use Weights and Biases.","start":2427.21,"duration":1.359},{"text":"And then you start running into time problems.","start":2428.569,"duration":2.201},{"text":"You know, you do more and more

can\nexpand it to autonomous vehicles.","start":2458.849,"duration":6.19},{"text":"What's one underrated aspect of machine learning\nor AV's that you think people should pay more","start":2465.039,"duration":4.77},{"text":"attention to than they do?","start":2469.809,"duration":1.53},{"text":"I noticed that there's a tendency to think\nof it as just a skill, and it's like you throw","start":2471.339,"duration":6.361},{"text":"it at your brain and it gets better and you\ncan do that over and over again and then you","start":2477.7,"duration":8.109},{"text":"may be able to get a good result.","start":2485.809,"duration":1.31},{"text":"But I always go back to the idea that one\nvery underrated aspect of machine learning","start":2487.119,"duration":4.301},{"text":"is that it has to be coupled with domain knowledge.","start":2491.42,"duration":2.779},{"text":"You really have to have a good understanding\nabout what problem you're solving and have","start":2494.199,"duration":4.8},{"text":"a good understanding of the domain.","start":2498.999,"duration":1.3},{"text":"In fact, I would say spend quite a bit of\ntime really understanding the data that you're","start":2500.299,"duration":4.57},{"text":"going to get.","start":2504.869,"duration":1.34},{"text":"And then because I said the right data is\nmore important than a lot of data, actually,","start":2506.209,"duration":5.711},{"text":"there was this interesting case where we made\nsome change and we cut down our data usage","start":2511.92,"duration":7.039},{"text":"by half, it became way cheaper for us and\nour model became more accurate.","start":2518.959,"duration":6.91},{"text":"So that's what you get by actually genuinely\nunderstanding.","start":2525.869,"duration":5.23},{"text":"And I would say I don't care too much about\ntheir domain knowledge but I think that's","start":2531.099,"duration":8.25},{"text":"something that I would say is very important\nin this area.","start":2539.349,"duration":5.841},{"text":"Especially with machine learning.","start":2545.19,"duration":2.899},{"text":"But you could argue it's true for any anything\nbut.","start":2548.089,"duration":3.411},{"text":"Yeah.","start":2551.5,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah.","start":2552.5,"duration":1.0},{"text":"All right.","start":2553.5,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Well said.","start":2554.5,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Today's last question is, you've actually\ndeployed several serious machine learning","start":2555.5,"duration":6.589},{"text":"products at scale, what's been the biggest\nchallenge in taking them from the experimental","start":2562.089,"duration":8.811},{"text":"stage to actually running in production?","start":2570.9,"duration":2.339},{"text":"So one of the biggest problems with machine\nlearning is that get into generalize right.","start":2573.239,"duration":6.08},{"text":"So there are a lot of tail events and the\nbeta is typically really sparse in your dataset","start":2579.319,"duration":8.9},{"text":"and trying to figure out why that happened,\nwhat happened is generally really difficult.","start":2588.219,"duration":8.041},{"text":"So this is one area that I can think you have\nto figure out how to combine machine learning","start":2596.26,"duration":7.349},{"text":"with other techniques.","start":2603.609,"duration":2.41},{"text":"You know, a place where you want to have absolute\nguarantees in a system like a robot where","start":2606.019,"duration":8.51},{"text":"there is actually no human intervention.","start":2614.529,"duration":3.111},{"text":"In other areas, I think there's some very\nnice properties if you're doing a human assist.","start":2617.64,"duration":5.929},{"text":"So ML has a really nice property of being\nable to do good

vaccines.","start":231.159,"duration":1.541},{"text":"So nowadays, I think DeepChem is slowly trying\nto grow out to enable open-source medicine","start":232.7,"duration":6.869},{"text":"discovery across a broader swath of modern\nbiotech.","start":239.569,"duration":7.09},{"text":"So that's just a little bit about the project.","start":246.659,"duration":1.64},{"text":"I think there is a very active community of\nusers.","start":248.299,"duration":3.26},{"text":"There's a number of educational materials\nand tutorials built up around it.","start":251.559,"duration":6.091},{"text":"I think it's also that a lot of medicine discovery\nis quite proprietary.","start":257.65,"duration":6.19},{"text":"There is biotech things that we often see\ntheir advertising material like in our proprietary","start":263.84,"duration":5.13},{"text":"algorithm, our proprietary technique, which\nhas worked fine for the industry for a

discovered.","start":275.66,"duration":2.03},{"text":"But, of course, as we know in tech there's\njust been a shift, in that open source is","start":277.69,"duration":4.34},{"text":"increasingly a foundational part of the way\nwe build companies, we discover things.","start":282.03,"duration":5.04},{"text":"So I think part of the goal of DeepChem is\nto bring some of this open-source energy to","start":287.07,"duration":5.43},{"text":"the biotech drug discovery community and enable\nmore people to be able to share in these tools.","start":292.5,"duration":7.2},{"text":"It seems like

would","start":301.81,"duration":8.35},{"text":"say, over half of the conversations I've had\nwith pharma companies have mentioned DeepChem,","start":310.16,"duration":5.13},{"text":"I thought it was pretty cool that they are\nusing the same platform and contributing IP.","start":315.29,"duration":8.23},{"text":"I didn't know that pharma did that at all.","start":323.52,"duration":2.33},{"text":"So that seems really wonderful.","start":325.85,"duration":3.03},{"text":"I think it definitely is kind of a new shift\nin thinking.","start":328.88,"duration":2.8},{"text":"But of course, you know, pharma has seen the\nfact that TensorFlow is open source, PyTorch's","start":331.68,"duration":4.54},{"text":"open source.","start":336.22,"duration":1.04},{"text":"So I think it is the beginnings of a shift.","start":337.26,"duration":3.15},{"text":"At the same time, I think IP considerations\ndefinitely do matter a lot.","start":340.41,"duration":4.8},{"text":"So I think a lot of folks find they can't\ncontribute at some places, which is fine,","start":345.21,"duration":5.98},{"text":"I think it's just a policy.","start":351.19,"duration":2.1},{"text":"But there is still a culture of caution around\npotentially releasing valuable IP.","start":353.29,"duration":4.57},{"text":"But I think what helps things a bit is there's\nthis recognition that oftentimes it's the","start":357.86,"duration":5.66},{"text":"actual data that's the core IP.","start":363.52,"duration":2.67},{"text":"It's not necessarily the algorithm that's\njust calculus.","start":366.19,"duration":2.98},{"text":"And so I think there is some favorable shifts\nin the industry, but it's definitely something","start":369.17,"duration":5.35},{"text":"that's only beginning to happen.","start":374.52,"duration":2.45},{"text":"So just taking a step back, because I think\nnot everyone necessarily

this.","start":382.43,"duration":4.44},{"text":"What's the canonical problem here that Pharma\nis trying to solve?","start":386.87,"duration":4.06},{"text":"Yeah, I think it's a great question.","start":390.93,"duration":3.37},{"text":"At heart, the goal really is to design medicine\nfor diseases you care about and the reality","start":394.3,"duration":7.71},{"text":"is this is an extraordinarily complicated\nprocess.","start":402.01,"duration":3.61},{"text":"And I'd say even now, machine learning is\nonly useful for 10% of it.","start":405.62,"duration":6.39},{"text":"And the task here is that say you identify\na disease, then you want to find a hypothesis","start":412.01,"duration":6.42},{"text":"for what causes the disease.","start":418.43,"duration":2.22},{"text":"Maybe there is a protein that somehow has\nbecome misconfigured or mutate in the body.","start":420.65,"duration":5.48},{"text":"There can be a whole host of disease-causing\nfactors but you oftentimes try to take a reductionist,","start":426.13,"duration":8.19},{"text":"you narrow that down to one protein target.","start":434.32,"duration":2.73},{"text":"So you say that if I somehow could change\nthe behavior of this protein, I could potentially","start":437.05,"duration":5.27},{"text":"cure this disease.","start":442.32,"duration":1.01},{"text":"It's a hypothesis.","start":443.33,"duration":1.28},{"text":"It might be right, It might be wrong, but\nit's a good starting place.","start":444.61,"duration":4.35},{"text":"Then you go out and you say, now I know this\nprotein.","start":448.96,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Can I find a molecule that causes it to have\nsome interaction?","start":452.08,"duration":4.18},{"text":"So there is a few mental models for this,\nyou can about it as a lock and key, you can","start":456.26,"duration":5.45},{"text":"think of it as basically an interacting agent\nthat comes in, the drug, that is, and shifts","start":461.71,"duration":7.36},{"text":"the behavior of the protein the way that's\nfavorable.","start":469.07,"duration":2.61},{"text":"So the goal computationally at a crude level\nis that design the molecule, given the description","start":471.68,"duration":6.51},{"text":"of this problem, print out the ideal molecule\nfor this.","start":478.19,"duration":2.99},{"text":"Now, the reason this gets challenging is that\nthe ideal molecule is extremely hard.","start":481.18,"duration":5.63},{"text":"I think one of the hardest problem here is\nthat there's this question of toxicity.","start":486.81,"duration":6.26},{"text":"I think the silly example for this is if you\nwant to kill cancer cells, you can pour bleach","start":493.07,"duration":3.42},{"text":"on them.","start":496.49,"duration":1.05},{"text":"You can't drink that bleach - that's going\nto kill you too.","start":497.54,"duration":3.65},{"text":"So a lot of medicine is pretty indistinguishable\nfrom poison.","start":501.19,"duration":4.11},{"text":"It's really targeted poison that goes after\none particular part of the body.","start":505.3,"duration":7.2},{"text":"So when you're designing medicine, you're\noften just struggling with this challenge,","start":512.5,"duration":3.879},{"text":"if you're on this very razor-thin design edge\nof between poison to medicine.","start":516.379,"duration":5.37},{"text":"You also often don't have a precise model\nof whether the potential drug works or not","start":521.749,"duration":5.77},{"text":"until you try it in real patients.","start":527.519,"duration":1.911},{"text":"So you try to make proxy models for this.","start":529.43,"duration":2.959},{"text":"Traditionally you'd have something like a\nrat that has some variant of the disease,","start":532.389,"duration":3.291},{"text":"or sometimes it's things like cats or even\ndogs but when you think it's safe, you then","start":535.68,"duration":7.159},{"text":"try it out on real patients.","start":542.839,"duration":1.44},{"text":"So this is kind of the clinical trial process:\nPhase One, which tests toxicity.","start":544.279,"duration":6.43},{"text":"Is it safe for humans?","start":550.709,"duration":1.12},{"text":"There's Phase Two that has efficacy.","start":551.829,"duration":2.211},{"text":"Is this actually showing effect in a group\nof patients I'm trying this on?","start":554.04,"duration":4.6},{"text":"And then Phase Three is basically \"OK.","start":558.64,"duration":1.98},{"text":"We think there is effect, let's make sure\non a big trial with lots of people.\"","start":560.62,"duration":5.18},{"text":"And occasionally there are things like Phase\nFour, which is after the drug is being used","start":565.8,"duration":3.31},{"text":"by real people, let's do more studies, understand\nthe real effects it's having on patients so","start":569.11,"duration":4.951},{"text":"that we can give better guidance to doctors.","start":574.061,"duration":3.268},{"text":"So I think the heart of the challenge in applying\nmachine learning here is that we are dealing","start":577.329,"duration":3.661},{"text":"with a lot of unknowns.","start":580.99,"duration":1.74},{"text":"We don't know precisely why things become\npoisonous.","start":582.73,"duration":3.709},{"text":"We know some of the reasons.","start":586.439,"duration":1.421},{"text":"But oftentimes you'll get these strange factors\nthat crop up.","start":587.86,"duration":3.409},{"text":"We don't know if a potential medicine actually\ntreats the disease in question until we try","start":591.269,"duration":5.13},{"text":"it.","start":596.399,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Just to slow down for a second.","start":597.399,"duration":2.1},{"text":"I think it's not even obvious to me necessarily\nwhat the machine learning problem is within","start":599.499,"duration":5.221},{"text":"that.","start":604.72,"duration":1.84},{"text":"What's the input data and what are we trying\nto predict?","start":606.56,"duration":3.67},{"text":"That's definitely another great question.","start":610.23,"duration":3.719},{"text":"And usually, the challenge here is that you\nstart with a very narrow sliver of this problem.","start":613.949,"duration":5.901},{"text":"So there are, say, limited models for toxicity\nthat given some amount of data, you create","start":619.85,"duration":5.33},{"text":"a database of compounds and you're like this\nmolecule induces a negative effect.","start":625.18,"duration":6.449},{"text":"You can train a machine learning model that\ngiven the structure of a new molecule, will","start":631.629,"duration":3.911},{"text":"predict an output, which is the toxicity label.","start":635.54,"duration":3.849},{"text":"The challenge, of course, is generalization.","start":639.389,"duration":1.351},{"text":"You know it works on your training set but\nif I give you a new molecule, does it actually","start":640.74,"duration":6.149},{"text":"work?","start":646.889,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That's often the question.","start":647.889,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That it's very hard to gauge that.","start":648.889,"duration":1.94},{"text":"And then how is it possible.?","start":650.829,"duration":1.411},{"text":"Sorry, there are some questions I have.","start":652.24,"duration":6.039},{"text":"How would you possibly have enough training\ndata?","start":658.279,"duration":2.47},{"text":"You're not going to keep poisoning cats to\nkeep finding more and more poisonous molecules,","start":660.749,"duration":5.181},{"text":"right?","start":665.93,"duration":1.0},{"text":"How does that work?","start":666.93,"duration":2.34},{"text":"I think there's another great question, and\nthe real answer is we don't have enough training","start":669.27,"duration":3.09},{"text":"data.","start":672.36,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Which is why I think molecular machine learning\nis a bit of an art right now.","start":673.36,"duration":5.07},{"text":"Unlike images and speech where there are these\ndramatically larger training sets, the datasets","start":678.43,"duration":6.33},{"text":"are fundamentally limited.","start":684.76,"duration":2.139},{"text":"There are a few approaches people take to\ndeal with this.","start":686.899,"duration":2.25},{"text":"I think one common theme is let's use more\nof the fact that we know a lot about physics","start":689.149,"duration":5.24},{"text":"and chemistry.","start":694.389,"duration":1.51},{"text":"Toxicity, I think is a very hard problem;\nit's biology.","start":695.899,"duration":5.021},{"text":"It's kind of harder.","start":700.92,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But in many cases, you'd say that \"well, okay,\nI know something about the molecule.","start":701.92,"duration":3.74},{"text":"I know something about its invariances.","start":705.66,"duration":2.25},{"text":"I can encode that into the convolution network.\"","start":707.91,"duration":3.929},{"text":"So now you have increasingly sophisticated\ngraph convolutional networks that encode more","start":711.839,"duration":6.72},{"text":"factors of known molecular structure.","start":718.559,"duration":4.72},{"text":"It's definitely not a salt field.","start":723.279,"duration":2.771},{"text":"I think this entire part of machine learning\nis far from what I call the image net moment,","start":726.05,"duration":5.07},{"text":"there is that point in which the thing just\ncrosses over and breaks out and I think right","start":731.12,"duration":5.6},{"text":"now it's useful, but it isn't that magic bullet\nin this order.","start":736.72,"duration":3.5},{"text":"I actually really would like to go back to\nthat but I want to make sure I understand","start":740.22,"duration":3.789},{"text":"the core problem here.","start":744.009,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So it sounds like you have a molecule and\nyou want to predict some kind of property?","start":745.009,"duration":7.02},{"text":"I think that is definitely the most common\none.","start":752.029,"duration":2.47},{"text":"There's a number of variants to this.","start":754.499,"duration":1.2},{"text":"Like you might have a protein, then you want\nto find a molecule that interacts with it.","start":755.699,"duration":4.771},{"text":"One way you can do this is, does the property\ninteract with the protein?","start":760.47,"duration":3.02},{"text":"There is also generative models where you\nsay that okay, given a database of known drugs","start":763.49,"duration":6.789},{"text":"use an LSTM or something to just print out\nthe new potential drug.","start":770.279,"duration":4.211},{"text":"This tends to get a little hairy.","start":774.49,"duration":2.24},{"text":"It's kind of hot research, but it's not safe\nto really use in production.","start":776.73,"duration":4.349},{"text":"I think there is some reaching academic debates\nabout that right now.","start":781.079,"duration":4.651},{"text":"Alright.","start":785.73,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Sorry, could I ask some more dumb questions?","start":786.73,"duration":1.389},{"text":"How do you even represent a molecule?","start":788.119,"duration":3.551},{"text":"Text seems kind of obvious to me but I mean,\nit seems like molecules have a variable length","start":791.67,"duration":4.839},{"text":"and they have some structure.","start":796.509,"duration":2.43},{"text":"Is it a graph?","start":798.939,"duration":1.32},{"text":"It's actually a great question.","start":800.259,"duration":3.101},{"text":"Thankfully there's the field of chemo informatics\nwhere a number of years ago they defined a","start":803.36,"duration":5.669},{"text":"thing which is called SMILES, S-M-I-L-E-S.","start":809.029,"duration":4.31},{"text":"So SMILES strings are basically a language\nthat allows you to write down molecules.","start":813.339,"duration":4.94},{"text":"It's most often used for small molecules but\nyou can write pretty big arbitrary molecules","start":818.279,"duration":3.941},{"text":"as well.","start":822.22,"duration":4.459},{"text":"Many architectures take the smiles and do\nconvert it into a graph.","start":826.679,"duration":4.21},{"text":"And the idea is that the atoms in the molecule\nturn into nodes in the graph and bonds usually","start":830.889,"duration":5.44},{"text":"turn into edges.","start":836.329,"duration":1.29},{"text":"Although sometimes you do something like a\ndistance cut off because there's these non-covalent","start":837.619,"duration":3.53},{"text":"interactions.","start":841.149,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So you might say all atoms that are close\nto each other are now bonds and have edges","start":842.149,"duration":5.901},{"text":"in my graph.","start":848.05,"duration":3.289},{"text":"And does that completely represent a molecule?","start":851.339,"duration":3.401},{"text":"Honestly, not at all.","start":854.74,"duration":3.62},{"text":"The real molecules are these very complex\nquantum beasts that have orbitals and extremely","start":858.36,"duration":7.169},{"text":"complicated wave functions.","start":865.529,"duration":2.54},{"text":"In fact, I'd say that when you get past really\nteensy molecules like helium (there's probably","start":868.069,"duration":7.12},{"text":"a few slightly more complicated ones), you\nactually don't know the quantum structure","start":875.189,"duration":3.7},{"text":"of these things.","start":878.889,"duration":1.471},{"text":"Until the quantum computers arrive and we\ncan run these simulations, we actually do","start":880.36,"duration":5.339},{"text":"not really have the ability to grasp the \"true\nstructure\" of a molecule in most cases.","start":885.699,"duration":6.091},{"text":"So it's an approximation.","start":891.79,"duration":2.019},{"text":"It's mostly useful for many purposes though.","start":893.809,"duration":2.39},{"text":"But yeah, molecules are more complicated than\nwe understand.","start":896.199,"duration":3.961},{"text":"In many cases.","start":900.16,"duration":1.59},{"text":"So when you talk about an LSTM generating\na molecule, it's generating, literally generating,","start":901.75,"duration":8.17},{"text":"a string that gets interpreted as a molecule?","start":909.92,"duration":2.789},{"text":"Exactly.","start":912.709,"duration":1.12},{"text":"So the smiles language I mentioned, precisely\nwhat you do is that you just treat it like","start":913.829,"duration":4.75},{"text":"a sentence generation task but you're generating\nin the smiles language.","start":918.579,"duration":4.711},{"text":"And oftentimes the

something?","start":1053.79,"duration":4.69},{"text":"So.","start":1058.48,"duration":1.67},{"text":"I think part of the challenge here is that\nit's hard.","start":1060.15,"duration":4.45},{"text":"There is like many steps in the process.","start":1064.6,"duration":2.03},{"text":"So there is a paper from Google recently where\nthey showed that on one particular task that,","start":1066.63,"duration":7.18},{"text":"when they ran the experiment, they say naively\nwas like a few percent hit rate.","start":1073.81,"duration":6.69},{"text":"That is like things that actually like looked\nlike they might work in that stage.","start":1080.5,"duration":3.87},{"text":"And when they bootstrapped it by training\nand machine learning model, then make

like one step out of like","start":1089.99,"duration":4.97},{"text":"20 in the process.","start":1094.96,"duration":2.821},{"text":"So, you take the thing that comes with that\nand you go to the next

need to, like, change it somehow so that\nit avoids that.","start":1105.46,"duration":3.25},{"text":"And right now, the best way to do that is\nstill to hire a seasoned team of

because you have very small amounts","start":1117.01,"duration":3.06},{"text":"of data.","start":1120.07,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So like the Google paper, it was at an early\nstage where they could generate programmatic","start":1121.07,"duration":5.06},{"text":"large datasets, like 50 million data points\nor something.","start":1126.13,"duration":2.88},{"text":"But in the later stages, you might have like\na hundred.","start":1129.01,"duration":3.49},{"text":"And then also you are in that fuzzy no man's\nworld in which machine learning is kind of","start":1132.5,"duration":6.28},{"text":"witchcraft.","start":1138.78,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I think that's part of the reason.","start":1139.78,"duration":1.55},{"text":"Because maybe you started out with something\nthat was AI-generated but then 10 medicinal","start":1141.33,"duration":5.71},{"text":"chemists came along, tweaked it here tweaked\nit there, then what do you have at the end?","start":1147.04,"duration":4.28},{"text":"And honestly, we don't know, like, I think\n10 years from now, maybe there will be a molecule","start":1151.32,"duration":3.94},{"text":"we can point to.","start":1155.26,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But for now, I think it's so fuzzy.","start":1156.26,"duration":1.73},{"text":"It's kind of interesting that you said I mean,\nI totally resonate with the ImageNet moment,","start":1157.99,"duration":5.09},{"text":"because I definitely remember the ImageNet\nmoment for vision, because I ran a company","start":1163.08,"duration":4.4},{"text":"that was selling training data and suddenly,\nyou know, everyone flipped from wanting text","start":1167.48,"duration":4.71},{"text":"training data to images because suddenly all\nthe image applications were working.","start":1172.19,"duration":4.52},{"text":"But I guess what was kind of interesting was\nthat I actually feel like the ImageNet moment","start":1176.71,"duration":5.44},{"text":"came a few years after ImageNet, like not\nonly did we see vision starting to work, but","start":1182.15,"duration":7.36},{"text":"it took people a while to realize it.","start":1189.51,"duration":1.57},{"text":"And then companies started to staff up.","start":1191.08,"duration":1.49},{"text":"And now, you know, I can go on Pinterest and\nclick on stuff and buy them right away.","start":1192.57,"duration":4.94},{"text":"Or I can find out my baby photos on my iPhone.","start":1197.51,"duration":4.19},{"text":"But like, it seems like this one, the medical\ncompanies have kind of staffed up maybe before","start":1201.7,"duration":7.1},{"text":"it's clear that it's working.","start":1208.8,"duration":1.24},{"text":"Because it does seem like deep learning is\nnow important to basically every Pharma company.","start":1210.04,"duration":4.45},{"text":"I mean, it seems like this could be set up\nfor a real serious disappointment also.","start":1214.49,"duration":5.74},{"text":"I think that's very kind of insightful as\nan observation and I think you're totally","start":1220.23,"duration":6.28},{"text":"right.","start":1226.51,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I think if you talk to a former veteran and\nthey'll talk, there's like this old

everything.","start":1245.69,"duration":3.65},{"text":"But I think the recurring theme of biology\nis that billions of years of evolution always","start":1249.34,"duration":5.26},{"text":"have more tricks behind them.","start":1254.6,"duration":2.59},{"text":"So I think you're right.","start":1257.19,"duration":1.74},{"text":"I think deep learning is a useful but not\nmagical tool in the space right now.","start":1258.93,"duration":5.82},{"text":"And I think that in some cases that disappointment\nhas already hit people.","start":1264.75,"duration":4.9},{"text":"I think in other cases still, my hope is that\npeople stick with it because I think these","start":1269.65,"duration":3.93},{"text":"techniques do have a lot to offer.","start":1273.58,"duration":2.6},{"text":"But I don't think it's going to magically\ncure cancer.","start":1276.18,"duration":2.87},{"text":"I think it'll be one useful tool in the scientist's\ntoolkit to discover medicine.","start":1279.05,"duration":6.12},{"text":"But what do you think caused people to feel\nthis optimism because machine learning techniques","start":1285.17,"duration":9.58},{"text":"have been around for quite a long time.","start":1294.75,"duration":1.16},{"text":"And I presume people were trying these on\nthe same datasets.","start":1295.91,"duration":3.03},{"text":"Like, is there something special about deep\nlearning that it sort of feels more promising","start":1298.94,"duration":4.45},{"text":"in some way?","start":1303.39,"duration":1.1},{"text":"It's a great question.","start":1304.49,"duration":2.25},{"text":"You know, I think, you know, we all saw this\namazing wave of just deep learning hype.","start":1306.74,"duration":5.95},{"text":"Because I think that ImageNet moment spread\nout into these other fields.","start":1312.69,"duration":4.7},{"text":"And I think people started hoping.","start":1317.39,"duration":4.18},{"text":"I think there are some genuinely new advances\nthat deep learning on molecules has engendered.","start":1321.57,"duration":6.25},{"text":"For example, the more predictive models, when\nyou have enough data, they actually start","start":1327.82,"duration":4.21},{"text":"working considerably better.","start":1332.03,"duration":2.24},{"text":"This Google paper I mentioned a while back,\nit actually gets like a considerable boost","start":1334.27,"duration":5.37},{"text":"over a simpler or random forest or something\nbecause it has enough data.","start":1339.64,"duration":3.66},{"text":"The generative

isn't that.","start":1352.25,"duration":3.65},{"text":"I think there is the hope that it might lead\nto a breakthrough.","start":1355.9,"duration":4.2},{"text":"And just speaking for me personally, when\nI started working in this field, I didn't","start":1360.1,"duration":3.37},{"text":"really understand any biology or chemistry,\nI think 9th bio classes, was my last

this?","start":1379.86,"duration":3.3},{"text":"Why not?","start":1383.16,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And I think the answer is evolution has had\nbillions of years and that just builds up","start":1384.16,"duration":4.29},{"text":"irreducible complexity sometimes.","start":1388.45,"duration":2.01},{"text":"So I think it's still hopeful.","start":1390.46,"duration":2.65},{"text":"I think there is real potential and value.","start":1393.11,"duration":3.68},{"text":"But I think also once you can spend some time\nin you get some humility, the scope of

hype cycle.","start":1414.56,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I think now we'll end that trough of disappointment\nand then that slope of enlightenment coming","start":1415.56,"duration":5.85},{"text":"up a few years from now.","start":1421.41,"duration":1.69},{"text":"Interesting.","start":1423.1,"duration":1.0},{"text":"People seem fairly optimistic for a trough\nof

hope\nnot.","start":1430.95,"duration":4.51},{"text":"One problem that I've always found in health\napplications is missing data.","start":1435.46,"duration":5.84},{"text":"Like, are there data sets like ImageNet for\nthese kinds of applications?","start":1441.3,"duration":5.56},{"text":"So honest answer, not really.","start":1446.86,"duration":1.61},{"text":"So I kind of started a project called MoleculeNet\na number of years back in grad school, along","start":1448.47,"duration":6.69},{"text":"with kind of one of my coauthors.","start":1455.16,"duration":1.87},{"text":"And our intent was to gather as many datasets\nas we could to try to make something like","start":1457.03,"duration":4.71},{"text":"ImageNet.","start":1461.74,"duration":1.4},{"text":"And I think the honest answer is we helped\na little bit.","start":1463.14,"duration":3.43},{"text":"I think there is a useful collection of data\nand benchmarks we put together.","start":1466.57,"duration":3.94},{"text":"But the challenge is that molecules are non...","start":1470.51,"duration":4.05},{"text":"So I think in computer vision, I think object\ndetection, object localization don't cover","start":1474.56,"duration":7.51},{"text":"all vision tasks.","start":1482.07,"duration":1.02},{"text":"I think their is some hard frontier of problems\nstill.","start":1483.09,"duration":2.69},{"text":"But you get like a pretty big chunk of them.","start":1485.78,"duration":2.72},{"text":"In molecules, it's more like there's just\nan entire range of things people want to do","start":1488.5,"duration":4.92},{"text":"with them.","start":1493.42,"duration":1.09},{"text":"You have a little bit of data for each task\nand the tasks are often not latent.","start":1494.51,"duration":4.49},{"text":"So if you take like a quantum mechanical dataset,\nyou'll find that very different featurization","start":1499.0,"duration":5.64},{"text":"and algorithms actually work better than if\nyou take a biophysical task or a biological","start":1504.64,"duration":5.59},{"text":"task.","start":1510.23,"duration":1.35},{"text":"So I think there is a reasonable amount of\ndata in aggregate.","start":1511.58,"duration":3.43},{"text":"But it's for different applications and you\ncan't easily blend it into one ImageNet style","start":1515.01,"duration":6.15},{"text":"mono data set yet.","start":1521.16,"duration":1.87},{"text":"Interesting.","start":1523.03,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It kind of reminds you of natural language\nprocessing with all of its different applications.","start":1524.03,"duration":8.67},{"text":"I think there is a dream that maybe we can\nfigure out some type of universal pretraining","start":1532.7,"duration":4.56},{"text":"that akin to the GPT2 models or to like actually\ndoes get you to that universal molecular model.","start":1537.26,"duration":8.61},{"text":"I think as of now, we haven't achieved it,\nbut maybe it's so crazy to think that we can.","start":1545.87,"duration":4.18},{"text":"Like, we do know that Schrodinger's equation\nat some deep level is pretty close to a, leaving","start":1550.05,"duration":6.43},{"text":"aside relativity, it's the best known model\nof these molecules we have.","start":1556.48,"duration":3.89},{"text":"So maybe if the quantum computers will eventually\nhelp solve this.","start":1560.37,"duration":4.6},{"text":"But it's a ways off for now.","start":1564.97,"duration":3.41},{"text":"Interesting.","start":1568.38,"duration":1.75},{"text":"And the experiments presumably are kind of\nexpensive to run now.","start":1570.13,"duration":3.62},{"text":"Yeah I think there's the rise of mail-order\nservices, things like Enamine or Muchi where","start":1573.75,"duration":8.89},{"text":"you can pick out a molecule out of a catalog,\nthen they'll make it for you and they'll ship","start":1582.64,"duration":4.25},{"text":"it to you.","start":1586.89,"duration":1.31},{"text":"So it's a little easier than it used to be.","start":1588.2,"duration":1.501},{"text":"You don't actually need to be a bench chemist\nat the same time you do still need to run","start":1589.701,"duration":5.009},{"text":"an experiment.","start":1594.71,"duration":1.31},{"text":"So oftentimes people will say use Enamine\nto buy it and they'll use a second contract","start":1596.02,"duration":4.38},{"text":"research organization to run the experiment\nand they'll just keep track of quality control.","start":1600.4,"duration":4.99},{"text":"So it is possible to do it, you know, not\nquite in your basement, I think.","start":1605.39,"duration":5.18},{"text":"But maybe in a well stocked garage where you\ncan carefully coordinate many e-mail threads","start":1610.57,"duration":5.27},{"text":"or something like that.","start":1615.84,"duration":1.45},{"text":"But, yeah, it's expensive.","start":1617.29,"duration":2.94},{"text":"It'll put you somewhere between a few hundred\nto a few thousand dollars per compound depending.","start":1620.23,"duration":7.07},{"text":"We have a whole bunch of customers that are\nstartups doing this type of thing, how do","start":1627.3,"duration":8.75},{"text":"they hope to kind of compete with bigger companies\nwhen they don't have access to these datasets?","start":1636.05,"duration":6.7},{"text":"That is a great question in many ways.","start":1642.75,"duration":4.38},{"text":"Maybe I'm not the right person to ask because\nI didn't found one of these startups.I think","start":1647.13,"duration":5.93},{"text":"there is some advantage to coming at it with\nsome new eyes.","start":1653.06,"duration":4.96},{"text":"I think when you're a very big company and\nare trying to introduce just a shift and thinking.","start":1658.02,"duration":4.47},{"text":"There is of course, a lot of cultural inertia.","start":1662.49,"duration":3.94},{"text":"Traditional startup versus Bigco dynamics.","start":1666.43,"duration":2.95},{"text":"I think there is some potential to pick up\nkind of interesting potentially looking fruit","start":1669.38,"duration":6.68},{"text":"that just people haven't looked at.","start":1676.06,"duration":3.02},{"text":"I think there is also some eventually, I think,\npotential for mergers and acquisitions.","start":1679.08,"duration":4.64},{"text":"I think building a talented machine learning\nteam can be difficult.","start":1683.72,"duration":3.09},{"text":"And I think if you have a company that has\nsucceeded and has shown some promise, maybe","start":1686.81,"duration":5.02},{"text":"it's a good acquisition target.","start":1691.83,"duration":1.04},{"text":"So I think there are fruitful paths forward\nfor many of these companies.","start":1692.87,"duration":5.96},{"text":"I think some of them are actually aiming really\nhigh.","start":1698.83,"duration":2.02},{"text":"They want to be the next Genentech.","start":1700.85,"duration":2.42},{"text":"And I think it is possible, but I think that\nmight end up coming down more to your biologists","start":1703.27,"duration":3.93},{"text":"than it does to your machine learning people.","start":1707.2,"duration":2.44},{"text":"And perhaps I'm a bit of a pessimist on that\nfront.","start":1709.64,"duration":4.1},{"text":"I think core biology, the really foundational\nstuff, is still beyond our current machine","start":1713.74,"duration":4.64},{"text":"learning and AI techniques.","start":1718.38,"duration":1.79},{"text":"I think it's beginning to change as you get\nmore genomics data, more kind of biological","start":1720.17,"duration":7.64},{"text":"material that you can feed into machine learning\nmodels, there's a lot of companies at that","start":1727.81,"duration":3.2},{"text":"frontier.","start":1731.01,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But for now, I think it really is that if\nyou have a crack team of scientists, that","start":1732.01,"duration":4.55},{"text":"might take you further than a crack team or\nmachine learning engineers.","start":1736.56,"duration":3.49},{"text":"Ideally have both, and then you have the best\nof all worlds,","start":1740.05,"duration":2.64},{"text":"Though it just seems like the data collection\nprocess is so hard.","start":1742.69,"duration":3.01},{"text":"It seems you might need to innovate there,\ntoo.","start":1745.7,"duration":2.68},{"text":"I mean, I'm coming from my own background\nof data leveling.","start":1748.38,"duration":5.27},{"text":"It seems so daunting, the idea that you have\nto order molecules somehow and run a wet lab.","start":1753.65,"duration":8.97},{"text":"I guess again, I have a whole bunch of different\nquestions.","start":1762.62,"duration":6.64},{"text":"One thought I have I guess is probably like\nthe dumb things that people think of when","start":1769.26,"duration":3.85},{"text":"they first hear about this stuff.","start":1773.11,"duration":1.3},{"text":"But it seems like if you could model things\nabout molecules, that's so powerful.","start":1774.41,"duration":5.08},{"text":"That's like the stuff everything's made out\nof.","start":1779.49,"duration":2.59},{"text":"Like, there must be applications besides biology\nthat might be simpler.","start":1782.08,"duration":4.25},{"text":"Is that is that true?","start":1786.33,"duration":2.0},{"text":"I think absolutely.","start":1788.33,"duration":1.15},{"text":"Now, unfortunately, the challenging part of\nsome of the most interesting applications","start":1789.48,"duration":3.85},{"text":"are in places like batteries.","start":1793.33,"duration":3.8},{"text":"So I think there are kind of other fields.","start":1797.13,"duration":3.91},{"text":"Like, for example, the crop protection industry.","start":1801.04,"duration":3.86},{"text":"So if you make pesticides, herbicides, fungicides,\npretty similar

that phenotype, it's like the\nexpression of a gene.","start":2040.64,"duration":4.18},{"text":"Is that right?","start":2044.82,"duration":1.66},{"text":"Yes, exactly.","start":2046.48,"duration":1.659},{"text":"So I think one way to think about it is maybe\nbottom-up design versus top-down design.","start":2048.139,"duration":6.071},{"text":"So kind of the

smart doctor.","start":2073.55,"duration":2.84},{"text":"This is like the penicillin story, notes some\neffect, you have no idea what the effect is","start":2076.39,"duration":4.8},{"text":"caused by.","start":2081.19,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You don't really understand the intricate\nbiophysics, the chemistry behind it.","start":2082.19,"duration":5.239},{"text":"But you see it, maybe there's something that\nyou just observe.","start":2087.429,"duration":5.471},{"text":"I think this famous case of penicillin wasn't\nthe mold on the bread.","start":2092.9,"duration":4.91},{"text":"But I think for a phenotypic screen like the\nones Recursion do.","start":2097.81,"duration":4.37},{"text":"Basically they have these cell-based acids\nwhere they grow cells in a petri dish.","start":2102.18,"duration":5.189},{"text":"And essentially they test, you put a little\nbit of medicine in there and then you see","start":2107.369,"duration":4.441},{"text":"how the cells state changes and use the microscope\nand the deep learning system on that to pick","start":2111.81,"duration":6.16},{"text":"up those changes.","start":2117.97,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So you can do this very rapidly.","start":2118.97,"duration":1.63},{"text":"What would be an example change?","start":2120.6,"duration":1.93},{"text":"Is that the cells are a different shape?","start":2122.53,"duration":4.42},{"text":"That's a really good question.","start":2126.95,"duration":4.91},{"text":"I think it often depends on the disease in\nquestion.","start":2131.86,"duration":2.42},{"text":"So like a common thing, say for like cancer\nis that, the silly one is can you kill the","start":2134.28,"duration":5.7},{"text":"tumor cells?","start":2139.98,"duration":3.6},{"text":"The hard part there is can you kill it without\nfinding bleach?","start":2143.58,"duration":4.32},{"text":"So that's something that's a medicine.","start":2147.9,"duration":2.16},{"text":"I think, for other readouts really depends\non the disease.","start":2150.06,"duration":5.3},{"text":"I think the general point there is like diseases\nare complicated.","start":2155.36,"duration":2.77},{"text":"So there are many proxys people use.","start":2158.13,"duration":2.54},{"text":"So kind of the hierarchy of proxy's is if\nyou have a pure test-tube, which is molecules,","start":2160.67,"duration":4.59},{"text":"that's like the weakest, if you have cells,\nthat's a little better, if you have a rat,","start":2165.26,"duration":5.54},{"text":"that's a little better; but I think the gold\nstandard of course, is like the human.","start":2170.8,"duration":5.41},{"text":"So you can think of this as like it's better\nthan the pure test-tube, but it's absolutely","start":2176.21,"duration":4.06},{"text":"not the same as a human, it is a useful kind\nof proxy.","start":2180.27,"duration":6.64},{"text":"So, okay.","start":2186.91,"duration":1.02},{"text":"So what the method with the machine learning\ndoes is kind of find properties based on the","start":2187.93,"duration":6.76},{"text":"images from the microscope?","start":2194.69,"duration":4.2},{"text":"The way I like to think about it is that machine\nlearning is kind of like making a better microscope.","start":2198.89,"duration":6.92},{"text":"So in many ways, if you go back to classical\nsignal processing.","start":2205.81,"duration":4.91},{"text":"We have all these, you know, Fourier transforms,\nyou have high pass filters, low pass filters.","start":2210.72,"duration":5.17},{"text":"And these, you know, traditional signal processing\ntechniques made things like microscopy even","start":2215.89,"duration":6.53},{"text":"feasible in the first place.","start":2222.42,"duration":1.98},{"text":"Well, you have purely kind of optical microscopes\nback in the day.","start":2224.4,"duration":6.3},{"text":"But in the last century, I think there's been\na lot of signal processing attached to it.","start":2230.7,"duration":3.29},{"text":"So I think of deep learning in these applications\nas signal processing, turned up to eleven.","start":2233.99,"duration":5.76},{"text":"And so you can pull things out of the image\nfor which there is no obvious way to write","start":2239.75,"duration":5.09},{"text":"down that function.","start":2244.84,"duration":3.13},{"text":"So I think right now it's more like this really\nfascinating scientific thing, you know there's","start":2247.97,"duration":4.99},{"text":"got to be something there.","start":2252.96,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But I want to make sure I'm like, picture\nit, like I want to have a mental model.","start":2253.96,"duration":3.77},{"text":"So, like, maybe that was evocative of like,\ndid I kill that tumor cell?","start":2257.73,"duration":3.83},{"text":"So is the point that like the machine learning\ncould tell me if the tumor cells were killed","start":2261.56,"duration":5.03},{"text":"without me having to actually look at it?\nor is it that the machine learning, like sees","start":2266.59,"duration":3.971},{"text":"something deeper that like I couldn't figure\nout if I looked at it.","start":2270.561,"duration":4.539},{"text":"So I'll have to apologize up front because\nI'm not an expert at cellular biology but","start":2275.1,"duration":5.7},{"text":"I'll try to.","start":2280.8,"duration":2.06},{"text":"So, for example, I might be making this up,\nso if there are real biologists that eventually","start":2282.86,"duration":5.96},{"text":"listen to this, please bear with me.","start":2288.82,"duration":1.37},{"text":"No, it's a machine-learning audience, you\ncan pontificate.","start":2290.19,"duration":3.25},{"text":"By the way I think machine learning people\nwill be really familiar with the idea of just","start":2293.44,"duration":7.08},{"text":"looking at results and not worry about the\nprocess behind it.","start":2300.52,"duration":2.59},{"text":"So I feel like this is very appealing to our\nmachine-learning audience.","start":2303.11,"duration":3.88},{"text":"You know, I do have to say I still have no\nway idea about what happens deep in layer","start":2306.99,"duration":4.379},{"text":"37 of my ConvNet.","start":2311.369,"duration":2.521},{"text":"Imagine you have a muscle cell and you can\noften measure like the stretchiness of the","start":2313.89,"duration":8.64},{"text":"muscle cell.","start":2322.53,"duration":2.77},{"text":"There is often ways to kind of guess that\na proxy for healthiness.","start":2325.3,"duration":5.04},{"text":"I think the actual thing you measure depends\na lot on the biology of the system.","start":2330.34,"duration":9.22},{"text":"For example, like one common thing is that\nthere is these things called fluorescent reporters","start":2339.56,"duration":7.69},{"text":"and you can engineer the cells so that if\nyou have the drug and it actually hits something","start":2347.25,"duration":5.23},{"text":"in the cell that you know about, it sets off\nlight.","start":2352.48,"duration":2.66},{"text":"Here, It's you have to know a little bit about\nwhat's happening inside the cell.","start":2355.14,"duration":3.06},{"text":"You have to have a guess already.","start":2358.2,"duration":2.23},{"text":"I think the cruder version might be, you know,\nyou have this muscle cell you're looking at.","start":2360.43,"duration":3.92},{"text":"You know, maybe there's some measure of how\nstretchY it is.","start":2364.35,"duration":3.69},{"text":"Oftentimes it's just like kind of obvious\nto the eye.","start":2368.04,"duration":4.33},{"text":"It's like that traditional, you know a dog\nwhen you see it.","start":2372.37,"duration":3.71},{"text":"You see the healthy cells, they have some,\nlike, nice geometric shape, it looks good.","start":2376.08,"duration":2.69},{"text":"And you see, like disease and they're all\nlike shriveled up and just looks bad.","start":2378.77,"duration":4.36},{"text":"And you can't quite write down that function.","start":2383.13,"duration":1.69},{"text":"You can't know when you look at it.","start":2384.82,"duration":1.75},{"text":"Yeah.","start":2386.57,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So it makes sense to begin to pick this up.","start":2387.57,"duration":2.79},{"text":"Right.","start":2390.36,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And I guess I've seen versions of like cancer\ncells and kind of different levels.","start":2391.36,"duration":4.59},{"text":"What do they call them, like biopsies?","start":2395.95,"duration":2.71},{"text":"Where you look at the cells.","start":2398.66,"duration":3.93},{"text":"Its 9th grade biology.","start":2402.59,"duration":3.6},{"text":"I guess I can picture what you're saying like\nthat there's like healthy cells.","start":2406.19,"duration":8.35},{"text":"My question is what is the machine learning\nhelping with?","start":2414.54,"duration":3.51},{"text":"Is it sort of like reducing the cost of looking\nat this stuff, or is it like pulling out other","start":2418.05,"duration":5.48},{"text":"signals that are somehow like, useful?","start":2423.53,"duration":3.57},{"text":"I think it's a bit of both.","start":2427.1,"duration":2.01},{"text":"So I think traditionally, the traditional\nlabor was you'd have a grad student whose","start":2429.11,"duration":4.89},{"text":"painful job it is.","start":2434.0,"duration":1.08},{"text":"If you're unfortunate to be stuck in this\nlab to is look at cell 1,2,3 ...10,000.one","start":2435.08,"duration":2.992},{"text":"to three, ten thousand.","start":2438.072,"duration":2.158},{"text":"Now, I think there a number of readouts where\nyou just look and you kind of know there is","start":2440.23,"duration":7.08},{"text":"a difference.","start":2447.31,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I think you can train yourself to read\nthese things.","start":2448.31,"duration":2.94},{"text":"I think this is, again like an interesting\nexample you brought up where you're training","start":2451.25,"duration":4.96},{"text":"the model to basically pick out something\nand you do it at a bigger scale to maybe before","start":2456.21,"duration":7.42},{"text":"I can only test 10000 views.","start":2463.63,"duration":1.45},{"text":"You know, the grad student union would revolt\nat that point.","start":2465.08,"duration":3.72},{"text":"But now, you know, maybe I can test a billion\nor I'm limited more by my supplies.","start":2468.8,"duration":5.53},{"text":"I think the second question you asked is actually\nthe more exciting one.","start":2474.33,"duration":3.83},{"text":"Is it possible we can pick out something we\ndidn't know?","start":2478.16,"duration":2.94},{"text":"So I think there are glimmers that this is\nyes, I know there are a few papers that are","start":2481.1,"duration":6.23},{"text":"doing things like you can identify where the\norganelles are, you can begin to do some more","start":2487.33,"duration":4.92},{"text":"complex readouts.","start":2492.25,"duration":1.16},{"text":"But I think there is sort of almost a chicken\nand egg problem here, as in like when you're","start":2493.41,"duration":5.89},{"text":"discovering something it's like unsupervised\nlearning, right?","start":2499.3,"duration":4.41},{"text":"If you know the thing you're looking for,\nthen you can, like, slot it into buckets pretty","start":2503.71,"duration":3.6},{"text":"easily.","start":2507.31,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But then if it's like you want to go deeper\nand find something you don't know.","start":2508.31,"duration":3.17},{"text":"I think yes, I think there are likely places\nthat ConvNets act as amplified microscopes","start":2511.48,"duration":7.83},{"text":"and like pick up biology that we don't know.","start":2519.31,"duration":2.44},{"text":"But if I knew that, I would have gone off\nand written nature paper about it already.","start":2521.75,"duration":6.08},{"text":"I'm sure there is a couple that have already\ncome out of this thing.","start":2527.83,"duration":4.59},{"text":"Okay.","start":2532.42,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I have to ask you, one of the Nature papers\nthat blew my mind and I think a lot of people","start":2533.42,"duration":4.25},{"text":"was the dermatologist's one where they fine-tuned\nan ImageNet classifier on cancers.","start":2537.67,"duration":9.39},{"text":"That was not like under a microscope, that\nwas just literally just like photos.","start":2547.06,"duration":8.02},{"text":"And that seemed so amazing.","start":2555.08,"duration":1.31},{"text":"I mean, should I be as enamored with that\nas I felt or are there some gotchas where","start":2556.39,"duration":6.35},{"text":"it's not actually like it?","start":2562.74,"duration":2.03},{"text":"Should we actually using doctors for these\ndiagnoses still?","start":2564.77,"duration":4.27},{"text":"It sort of seemed like from the paper that\nit was more accurate than the doctor's diagnosis,","start":2569.04,"duration":6.09},{"text":"wasn't it?","start":2575.13,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You know, I think that entire field for sure,\nI think is like radiology or I think usually","start":2576.13,"duration":6.31},{"text":"it's like pathology or like dermatology.","start":2582.44,"duration":3.72},{"text":"You look at some picture and then you kind\nof diagnose it, I think that absolutely is","start":2586.16,"duration":3.82},{"text":"a place ConvNets will just make a big difference.","start":2589.98,"duration":3.09},{"text":"And I do think that these models do kind of\nachieve a striking advance over what you could","start":2593.07,"duration":5.89},{"text":"do previously.","start":2598.96,"duration":2.3},{"text":"So my understanding is that the challenge\nthere is that sometimes these models pick","start":2601.26,"duration":4.65},{"text":"up things that are kind of silly.","start":2605.91,"duration":1.87},{"text":"I remember there is this really excellent\nblog post where we kind of discussed failed","start":2607.78,"duration":7.339},{"text":"models that are turned out.","start":2615.119,"duration":1.081},{"text":"There are like scans

accuracy\nknow something is up.","start":2620.89,"duration":4.87},{"text":"It turned out there's like some label at the\nbottom or something that printed to the

right\nthere.","start":2632.2,"duration":3.11},{"text":"So I think it kind of comes down to, what\nis the model learning?","start":2635.31,"duration":5.809},{"text":"Is it a

a view that","start":2894.05,"duration":7.059},{"text":"is not as commonly celebrated.","start":2901.109,"duration":2.401},{"text":"But I think there is these really exciting\nthings going

internet of things , but like\nnot the consumer version.","start":2913.44,"duration":5.29},{"text":"I think traditionally new scientific instruments\nare the predecessor to fundamental new scientific","start":2918.73,"duration":8.56},{"text":"discovery.","start":2927.29,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I think that when we find deep learning\nis making our instruments better and more","start":2928.29,"duration":3.72},{"text":"capable.","start":2932.01,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Then I think that we're actually setting ourselves\nup to discover and build fundamental science.","start":2933.01,"duration":3.81},{"text":"So that's something I'm very excited by.","start":2936.82,"duration":2.04},{"text":"But it's kind of a longer...","start":2938.86,"duration":3.07},{"text":"We might have the instrument and we still\nneed the Einstein or something to come in","start":2941.93,"duration":2.95},{"text":"and work that and really get us that magical\nnew understanding about the world.","start":2944.88,"duration":5.17},{"text":"But I'm excited by that.","start":2950.05,"duration":2.18},{"text":"That is a totally cool answer.","start":2952.23,"duration":1.119},{"text":"But I guess they may give some many readings\nthat it's like hard to even interpret, but","start":2953.349,"duration":4.071},{"text":"I guess a good algorithm would give you a\nfew high values what you call processed outputs","start":2957.42,"duration":8.24},{"text":"like that.","start":2965.66,"duration":2.83},{"text":"I think for now it's still going to be quite\na while before.","start":2968.49,"duration":3.15},{"text":"I think we see.","start":2971.64,"duration":2.43},{"text":"I think we talk a lot about HTI and I know\nthere are many ways

guess the reason I naively find them exciting","start":3009.099,"duration":8.151},{"text":"is that, like if you're trying to compete\nwith the human for navigation and driving.","start":3017.25,"duration":5.46},{"text":"Our brains are designed for that.","start":3022.71,"duration":2.63},{"text":"Clearly, like huge part of our brain is just\nto navigate the world and

see","start":3030.13,"duration":5.46},{"text":"and like what effects they might have.","start":3035.59,"duration":1.95},{"text":"I mean, I'm still trying to visualize it in\nmy head, I can't even do

world.","start":3065.53,"duration":5.15},{"text":"Maybe, part of the challenge is that it's\nhard to validate a discovery.","start":3070.68,"duration":5.189},{"text":"Many times a model says something, but after\nyou spend a while like 9 times out of 10,","start":3075.869,"duration":4.841},{"text":"you're like what bullshit did the system pick\nup this time.","start":3080.71,"duration":3.48},{"text":"And I think the challenge there is like maybe\nwe have to make the model like you said, we","start":3084.19,"duration":5.302},{"text":"have to make the models robust enough that\nthere is actually high-quality signals coming","start":3089.492,"duration":3.888},{"text":"out.","start":3093.38,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So we're like, oh, that's a clue or

beginning to change.","start":3107.92,"duration":1.33},{"text":"It feels like still discovery, like invention\nis the province of the human and not the

comes\nto pass.","start":3123.88,"duration":4.75},{"text":"All right.","start":3128.63,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So final question is, so, you know, right\nnow in 2020.","start":3129.63,"duration":4.11},{"text":"I guess its already June, what do you think\nis.","start":3133.74,"duration":3.28},{"text":"What do you think is currently the biggest\nchallenge of

you've run into?","start":3143.14,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Like what have been the surprising hurdles?","start":3146.42,"duration":2.97},{"text":"I think things more specific to me are often\nsmall data.","start":3149.39,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Like, again, you have 30 data points and oftentimes\nit's a very well-meaning scientist who kind","start":3153.94,"duration":7.169},{"text":"of comes and says, what can you do for us\nwith 30 data points?","start":3161.109,"duration":2.731},{"text":"yet oftentimes I'm like, oooh, I wish I had\na better answer.","start":3163.84,"duration":7.97},{"text":"Sometimes you just try seven things like you're\ntrying to transfer learning and you try like","start":3171.81,"duration":4.19},{"text":"multitask learning, the mental learning and\nall the learning fail.","start":3176.0,"duration":3.099},{"text":"And then at the end, the random forces like,\nyeah, it's all great, but it does something.","start":3179.099,"duration":5.151},{"text":"So I think for things I'm excited by, I think\nrobust transfer learning that actually works","start":3184.25,"duration":6.5},{"text":"on small data, which I think this has occurred\nin NLP.","start":3190.75,"duration":4.25},{"text":"But I think has not occurred in molecules,\nI think that would be an amazing advance

it's also\ntotally happened in vision for sure.","start":3200.38,"duration":3.28},{"text":"And NLP now, definitely it's too interesting.","start":3203.66,"duration":3.459},{"text":"It doesn't work for molecules.","start":3207.119,"duration":1.091},{"text":"It might just be data.","start":3208.21,"duration":2.389},{"text":"I think if someone just found a gigantic trove\nof molecular measurements, so

that\nright.","start":3217.64,"duration":2.05},{"text":"I think this is just one thing that I think\nthe governmental effort could do, like

the","start":3226.15,"duration":4.44},{"text":"open-source data out there.","start":3230.59,"duration":1.38},{"text":"So they are actually working hard at this.","start":3231.97,"duration":2.03},{"text":"But, yeah, maybe the sort of thing that like\nif you get a $10,000,000 grant or something.","start":3234.0,"duration":4.94},{"text":"I think you could make a serious dent at putting\ntogether a high-quality open data set for","start":3238.94,"duration":5.44},{"text":"this but it is more expensive than ImageNet,\nand it will take more

taught","start":258.859,"duration":6.911},{"text":"a course.","start":265.77,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Your third year as an

undergrad, I feel embarrassed.","start":271.36,"duration":3.54},{"text":"To be fair, I was like older than most people,\nright?","start":274.9,"duration":6.129},{"text":"And I actually didn't have to spend time on\nfrat parties, or trying to like impress people.","start":281.029,"duration":5.28},{"text":"I was pretty much done with the party scene\nby then.","start":286.309,"duration":3.711},{"text":"Right, so you taught a really popular class,\nright?","start":290.02,"duration":5.229},{"text":"I think you could say it was a popular class,\nI could say.","start":295.249,"duration":2.621},{"text":"I think you can say that.","start":297.87,"duration":4.59},{"text":"It was quite unexpected.","start":302.46,"duration":1.679},{"text":"I didn\u2019t even know that the class was popular.","start":304.139,"duration":3.09},{"text":"I was just teaching it.","start":307.229,"duration":2.131},{"text":"And one day walking to the dining hall, a\nfriend

on Hacker News?","start":313.71,"duration":4.049},{"text":"And it turned out that my course had been\npicked up by hackernews and I was like wow,","start":317.759,"duration":2.521},{"text":"that's interesting.","start":320.28,"duration":1.03},{"text":"And at some point, you know what happened?","start":321.31,"duration":3.52},{"text":"I was not really active on twitter back then\nand one day I opened twitter and I saw I had","start":324.83,"duration":5.059},{"text":"ten thousand followers and I went, \u201cWow.","start":329.889,"duration":1.661},{"text":"Who are these people?\u201d","start":331.55,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It was great.","start":332.55,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Well, it was timely class.","start":333.55,"duration":1.0},{"text":"What was the topic of the class?","start":334.55,"duration":1.64},{"text":"Just for people who might not know.","start":336.19,"duration":1.539},{"text":"Oh, it was TensorFlow.","start":337.729,"duration":2.02},{"text":"I think it was the right time.","start":339.749,"duration":2.04},{"text":"TensorFlow was very popular in 2016.","start":341.789,"duration":4.37},{"text":"Wow.","start":346.159,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It's crazy how fast things change.","start":347.159,"duration":3.161},{"text":"Like back then in 2016, Tensorflow was all\npeople could talk about and now it\u2019s what","start":350.32,"duration":5.64},{"text":"people complain about.","start":355.96,"duration":1.109},{"text":"So, yeah.","start":357.069,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I taught a course on TensorFlow and the\nofficial name was TensorFlow for Deep Learning","start":358.069,"duration":7.81},{"text":"Research, which is a not-so-flashy name and\nI think I also put a lot of materials online.","start":365.879,"duration":10.28},{"text":"And I think it was maybe the first college\nlevel course on TensorFlow.","start":376.159,"duration":3.111},{"text":"I\u2019m trying to remember it in 2016, I think\nyou must\u2019ve had to compile it yourself right,","start":379.27,"duration":6.04},{"text":"to use the GPU back then?","start":385.31,"duration":2.0},{"text":"I'm trying to remember\u2026","start":387.31,"duration":2.16},{"text":"I remember just installing TensorFlow as a\npretty painful experience for me.","start":389.47,"duration":4.3},{"text":"I don't remember it to be so painful.","start":393.77,"duration":3.13},{"text":"It was just some concepts that were a little\nbit hard to grasp.","start":396.9,"duration":4.409},{"text":"As in like a computation graph; so there should\nbe a graph first before you can run it.","start":401.309,"duration":6.38},{"text":"So I think Tensorflow 2.0 now is a bit different.","start":407.689,"duration":3.361},{"text":"Got it.","start":411.05,"duration":1.399},{"text":"How did you come up with the material for\nthat class?","start":412.449,"duration":5.381},{"text":"How did you even think of that?","start":417.83,"duration":1.509},{"text":"So when I started teaching the course, I was\njust hoping to learn personally, you know?","start":419.339,"duration":6.44},{"text":"I started taking courses as a sophomore, sometime\nin my second year.","start":425.779,"duration":4.131},{"text":"So I didn't know a lot.","start":429.91,"duration":3.509},{"text":"I interned at a start up where they used Tensorflow\nit was an internship and I was blown away.","start":433.419,"duration":8.261},{"text":"Like, wow, I didn't realize you could do so\nmany things with it.","start":441.68,"duration":3.699},{"text":"So I went to a couple of my professors and\nwas like, can you teach a course on this?","start":445.379,"duration":4.592},{"text":"And my professor was like, I don't have time.","start":449.971,"duration":1.908},{"text":"Why don't you teach it?","start":451.879,"duration":1.711},{"text":"So I was OK.","start":453.59,"duration":2.74},{"text":"And I got a lot of people to help me.","start":456.33,"duration":3.01},{"text":"I had some friends at Google who knew a lot\nabout tensor flow, I had professors take a","start":459.34,"duration":9.879},{"text":"look at my curriculum and got a lot of feedback.","start":469.219,"duration":4.341},{"text":"I read lecture notes.","start":473.56,"duration":1.9},{"text":"I was really nervous so I had really good\nfriends who were coerced into being my fake","start":475.46,"duration":8.34},{"text":"students.","start":483.8,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So for every lecture, I would make them sit\nand listen to me.","start":484.8,"duration":8.01},{"text":"Give them a fake lecture.","start":492.81,"duration":3.3},{"text":"So I think I got a lot of help.","start":496.11,"duration":1.82},{"text":"It was like learning together with my students.","start":497.93,"duration":2.549},{"text":"I didn't think of it as teaching as much as\na group study.","start":500.479,"duration":4.791},{"text":"That's super cool.","start":505.27,"duration":2.28},{"text":"When you came to Stanford, you hadn't taken\nany computer science class before?","start":507.55,"duration":5.83},{"text":"So I came from a math background, so I did\nmath in high school.","start":513.38,"duration":4.349},{"text":"So I think I took some C.S courses but, you\nknow, it was more like very, very basic.","start":517.729,"duration":6.25},{"text":"And if I remember, it was a blue screen back\nthen.","start":523.979,"duration":4.121},{"text":"Wow.","start":528.1,"duration":1.25},{"text":"Yeah.","start":529.35,"duration":1.25},{"text":"This is simply amazing, you went from introductory\ncomputer science type stuff to teaching a","start":530.6,"duration":9.58},{"text":"TensorFlow class two years later.","start":540.18,"duration":3.19},{"text":"It\u2019s amazing.","start":543.37,"duration":1.279},{"text":"Do you have any advice to other people who\nwant to learn this stuff?","start":544.649,"duration":6.471},{"text":"I think this is the beauty of computer science;\nthe barrier\u2019s to entry is really low.","start":551.12,"duration":5.389},{"text":"Also with ML.","start":556.509,"duration":1.82},{"text":"Especially with the experiment-oriented progress\nwhich translates to mean that you actually","start":558.329,"duration":6.771},{"text":"don't need to know a lot of theories to make\na contribution.","start":565.1,"duration":3.69},{"text":"So I've seen people who get into ML for like\na year and are able to make pretty great projects.","start":568.79,"duration":7.34},{"text":"Which like I am still a little ambivalent\nabout it.","start":576.13,"duration":2.829},{"text":"It\u2019s good as it lowers the entry barrier\nand allows more people from different backgrounds","start":578.959,"duration":4.831},{"text":"get into it.","start":583.79,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So like what does it say about the field,\nwhen somebody joins for a year and is able","start":584.79,"duration":4.71},{"text":"to make a pretty mind-blowing experiment.","start":589.5,"duration":3.68},{"text":"So I don't know how to feel like...","start":593.18,"duration":5.17},{"text":"Maybe it means that there's lots of interesting\nstuff to try [laughs]","start":598.35,"duration":7.429},{"text":"I'm so skeptical of giving advice.","start":605.779,"duration":2.56},{"text":"I think I\u2019ll just say get your hands dirty.","start":608.339,"duration":3.141},{"text":"Then try things, try things out and be friends\nwith smart people.","start":611.48,"duration":4.31},{"text":"Be friends with smart people [laughs]","start":615.79,"duration":1.919},{"text":"[laughs] I have friends smarter than you,\nI think.","start":617.709,"duration":3.662},{"text":"I don't think I could have got anything done\nwithout my friends.","start":621.371,"duration":3.129},{"text":"Really.","start":624.5,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That\u2019s so cool.","start":625.5,"duration":1.12},{"text":"I think that's good advice.","start":626.62,"duration":2.65},{"text":"Why did you choose to go into AI?","start":629.27,"duration":2.27},{"text":"For me, it was just the promise that AI held.","start":631.54,"duration":4.64},{"text":"So I come from a village in Vietnam and I\ntravelled and there was a time I realized","start":636.18,"duration":6.099},{"text":"that it could be great to actually overcome\nlanguage barriers.","start":642.279,"duration":6.56},{"text":"For the simple majority of human knowledge,\nit\u2019s written in English, and people who","start":648.839,"duration":5.591},{"text":"don't speak English can't access it.","start":654.43,"duration":2.3},{"text":"Like people in my hometown can't really read\nanything that I write in English or my parents","start":656.73,"duration":5.279},{"text":"are afraid of visiting me in the U.S. because\nthey wouldn't be able to navigate the airport","start":662.009,"duration":5.88},{"text":"or how to get here.","start":667.889,"duration":3.791},{"text":"So at this time, I was really interested in\nmachine translation and thinking if you can","start":671.68,"duration":8.0},{"text":"automate a translation process, then it could\nbe really, really helpful and if we can overcome","start":679.68,"duration":8.76},{"text":"the language barriers and help people, then\nmaybe people from my village can access human","start":688.44,"duration":7.001},{"text":"knowledge or just step out of the border.","start":695.441,"duration":4.088},{"text":"That's so cool.","start":699.529,"duration":1.391},{"text":"That's what I thought back then and very idealistic.","start":700.92,"duration":4.87},{"text":"What are the topics that are most interesting\nto you right now in machine learning?","start":705.79,"duration":7.83},{"text":"I think over time, what we are liking is better\nengineering in machine learning.","start":713.62,"duration":6.579},{"text":"So there are two aspects, both as in engineering\nand in research and during production.","start":720.199,"duration":9.661},{"text":"So in research there are a lot of researchers\nwho are amazing at what they do, but who are","start":729.86,"duration":8.14},{"text":"also not good with engineers and it's not\nbecause of them, it's just because as humans,","start":738.0,"duration":5.5},{"text":"our time is limited.","start":743.5,"duration":2.089},{"text":"We focus too much on research.","start":745.589,"duration":2.671},{"text":"We can't expect them to be great engineers.","start":748.26,"duration":2.639},{"text":"So I wonder if there is a better.. if we can\nbuild a good tool or toolset to help researchers","start":750.899,"duration":7.81},{"text":"carry out their research more efficiently.","start":758.709,"duration":4.341},{"text":"Also if you have clean code, it\u2019s easier\nto experiment and this helps with reproducibility","start":763.05,"duration":7.8},{"text":"and in production, I also think that there\u2019s\na gap with people; researchers and production","start":770.85,"duration":7.039},{"text":"engineers.","start":777.889,"duration":1.2},{"text":"I think there's been a lot of progress in\nresearching machine learning and now the question","start":779.089,"duration":6.1},{"text":"is how do we bring the research into production\nand that\u2019s what I'm very interested in and","start":785.189,"duration":5.171},{"text":"also the start-up I'm part of right now is\nalso focusing on that by helping companies","start":790.36,"duration":4.45},{"text":"productionize","start":794.81,"duration":46.12},{"text":"machine research.","start":840.93,"duration":11.61},{"text":"You've worked with some big companies, generally\nwhat kinds of problems do you see when companies","start":852.54,"duration":50.27},{"text":"try to take on research and production?","start":902.81,"duration":1.6},{"text":"What are the main ways you see companies fail\nat this?","start":904.41,"duration":3.25},{"text":"One of the big things is a lot of companies\nare chasing buzzwords.","start":907.66,"duration":8.029},{"text":"They are like how can we use BERT, How can\nwe use transformers?","start":915.689,"duration":5.871},{"text":"And you can look at them and say you actually\ndon't need that.","start":921.56,"duration":4.219},{"text":"You don't even need deep learning.","start":925.779,"duration":1.68},{"text":"Like, a lot of your problems can be solved\nby traditional classical algorithms.","start":927.459,"duration":5.86},{"text":"So sometimes companies say things like this\none should use very fancy techniques.","start":933.319,"duration":8.611},{"text":"The reason can be because they don't understand\nwhat is happening, because I think there is","start":941.93,"duration":6.94},{"text":"a lot of misunderstanding in AI reporting\nthat you will see, like a lot of journalists","start":948.87,"duration":5.709},{"text":"and reporters talking about AI and if they\ndon't have background in AI they can simplify","start":954.579,"duration":7.391},{"text":"or just present it as an accessory they give.","start":961.97,"duration":2.179},{"text":"Like what?","start":964.149,"duration":1.0},{"text":"What exactly is going on?","start":965.149,"duration":1.361},{"text":"And it's like in some companies may just want\nto attract clients, like you said, they say","start":966.51,"duration":4.749},{"text":"we are using state-of-the-art techniques.","start":971.259,"duration":4.56},{"text":"So some companies actually go out of their\nway to try to use that.","start":975.819,"duration":4.81},{"text":"So that\u2019s one problem.","start":980.629,"duration":1.421},{"text":"I think the second is a lack of data, and\nI think you guys know that very well because","start":982.05,"duration":7.81},{"text":"you also are trying to solve that problem,\nright?","start":989.86,"duration":4.169},{"text":"So in research, people work with very clean\nstatic datasets and in any business, you'll","start":994.029,"duration":7.5},{"text":"want a clean and standard datasets because\nyou want to focus on separate models.","start":1001.529,"duration":5.0},{"text":"I think more and more as models are being\ncommoditized, you can take off-the-shelf models.","start":1006.529,"duration":5.461},{"text":"So now the bottleneck is data and real world\ndata is nowhere close to research data.","start":1011.99,"duration":8.05},{"text":"So the problem is how do you collect data\nand verify data, how do you cope with constant","start":1020.04,"duration":5.77},{"text":"distribution shifting\/data drift?","start":1025.81,"duration":4.97},{"text":"So there's a problem with data.","start":1030.78,"duration":2.17},{"text":"Another problem is with interpretability.","start":1032.95,"duration":5.48},{"text":"So in research, sometimes you can have more\nof the state-of-the-art but also in the real","start":1038.43,"duration":10.36},{"text":"world, you just don't care about accuracy\nor F1 or whatever metric do you were seeing].","start":1048.79,"duration":9.43},{"text":"How can we explain the decisions that the\nmodel is making?","start":1058.22,"duration":5.68},{"text":"I think a lot of people are focusing a lot\nof time on this so I think we are making progress.","start":1063.9,"duration":12.11},{"text":"It's funny, I saw a tweet recently.","start":1076.01,"duration":2.31},{"text":"I think it was someone had Opeen AI who was\narguing that folks should not teach anything","start":1078.32,"duration":7.57},{"text":"besides neural nets.","start":1085.89,"duration":1.35},{"text":"Oh my God, it\u2019s such click bait.","start":1087.24,"duration":2.11},{"text":"And it's funny because it reminded me of when\nI got my first job out of school.","start":1089.35,"duration":6.39},{"text":"There was sort of a similar debate but it\nwas different topics, it was basically like","start":1095.74,"duration":4.56},{"text":"machine learning versus rule-based systems.","start":1100.3,"duration":2.34},{"text":"And there were a lot of older researchers\nwho had kind of built their careers on logic","start":1102.64,"duration":4.92},{"text":"and rule-based systems.","start":1107.56,"duration":2.4},{"text":"And they would say, oh, obviously you should\ndo both and I was like, \u201cCome on!","start":1109.96,"duration":4.54},{"text":"Rule-based systems don\u2019t really work on\nanything.","start":1114.5,"duration":2.13},{"text":"Can you find me a benchmark where it actually\nmakes sense to use a rule-based system?\u201d","start":1116.63,"duration":6.41},{"text":"And I was thinking, that\u2019s how I felt at\nthe time and I think I might still\u2026","start":1123.04,"duration":3.53},{"text":"I mean, you don't see a lot of rule-based\nsystems in production in the

thinking, you know, when that\nperson made a click-bait tweet and I went,","start":1135.58,"duration":4.16},{"text":"no, no, it's ridiculous.","start":1139.74,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And then now

a model is,\nit\u2019s easier to understand, implement and","start":1258.35,"duration":6.401},{"text":"to avoid mistakes.","start":1264.751,"duration":3.589},{"text":"So if you don't get improvement from more\ncomplicated methods, don't go there.","start":1268.34,"duration":9.79},{"text":"It's also hard to tell because a lot of improvement\nis incremental, right?","start":1278.13,"duration":4.42},{"text":"So you can say this only gives 1% improvement,\nit's not worth it.","start":1282.55,"duration":4.17},{"text":"But for like a 1% improvement, you invest\nmore time investing again, then another and","start":1286.72,"duration":6.03},{"text":"another and another and over time, you can\nget it up to 10% improvement but stifle it","start":1292.75,"duration":4.58},{"text":"from the beginning, then you would never be\nable to reach the point where it should be.","start":1297.33,"duration":6.67},{"text":"I\u2019m not pro using

enough","start":1311.19,"duration":5.09},{"text":"time talking about or defending baselines.","start":1316.28,"duration":3.61},{"text":"Interesting.","start":1319.89,"duration":1.0},{"text":"A lot of people have said that and I happen\nto agree with them, but if someone were to","start":1320.89,"duration":4.23},{"text":"ask you why are baselines important, how would\nyou answer that?","start":1325.12,"duration":6.41},{"text":"A metric, by itself, doesn't mean anything.","start":1331.53,"duration":2.51},{"text":"You saying 90% accuracy doesn't mean anything.","start":1334.04,"duration":3.73},{"text":"So we say, \u201cOh, my model is amazing.","start":1337.77,"duration":1.82},{"text":"It has this accuracy.\u201d","start":1339.59,"duration":2.52},{"text":"What does that even mean?","start":1342.11,"duration":3.16},{"text":"For example, somebody showed me this model\nand is like it has 90%

point of getting this?","start":1357.36,"duration":6.33},{"text":"So I think baselines and landmarks should\nhelp you localize where the model performance","start":1363.69,"duration":5.67},{"text":"is and where you want it to get you.","start":1369.36,"duration":1.94},{"text":"Also interestingly looking at human baselines,\nfor example.","start":1371.3,"duration":4.62},{"text":"If humans could just

long road to go.","start":1393.76,"duration":4.51},{"text":"So the human baseline is maybe in some sense\nlike a best case

so","start":1404.38,"duration":7.58},{"text":"always.","start":1411.96,"duration":1.15},{"text":"Right.","start":1413.11,"duration":1.15},{"text":"Another thing I'm curious about is your work\non this, because I think fake news is probably","start":1414.26,"duration":8.44},{"text":"going to be a big topic again with the election\ncoming up.","start":1422.7,"duration":3.52},{"text":"I think this was a fun class project.","start":1426.22,"duration":3.12},{"text":"So it was after the election and we were curious\nto see\u2026","start":1429.34,"duration":4.1},{"text":"I think echo chamber can also help echoing\nfake news.","start":1433.44,"duration":5.47},{"text":"I feel like the same fake news is usually\ncirculating the same echo chamber.","start":1438.91,"duration":5.94},{"text":"And, you know, if one echo chamber shares\na certain piece of news and now the echo chamber","start":1444.85,"duration":9.4},{"text":"shares similar news but with different prospective,\nI'm not sure how healthy this might be but","start":1454.25,"duration":5.85},{"text":"it might be interesting to cross-share, to\nbring the similar piece of news from one prospective","start":1460.1,"duration":6.16},{"text":"to another echo chamber.Not fake news, of\ncourse, there\u2019s no point in spreading fake","start":1466.26,"duration":4.13},{"text":"news from one echo chamber to another.","start":1470.39,"duration":4.26},{"text":"So what we did was that we got a lot of tweets\nand formed hashtags.","start":1474.65,"duration":4.49},{"text":"At that time, as I said, it was after the\nelection, so we collected a lot of tweets","start":1479.14,"duration":6.28},{"text":"from during the elections in U.S. sitting\nstates and what we did was we had some seed","start":1485.42,"duration":6.2},{"text":"hashtags that we know was from tweets that\nwere pro-Republican or pro-Democratic.","start":1491.62,"duration":7.38},{"text":"So from those seed hashtags, we made exemptions\nthat if two hashtags belong in the same tweet,","start":1499.0,"duration":8.64},{"text":"then they likely have the same sentiment.","start":1507.64,"duration":8.37},{"text":"If one hashtag appears next to a hashtag that\u2019s\npro-Republican then it's likely to also be","start":1516.01,"duration":6.15},{"text":"pro-Republican.","start":1522.16,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So from that, we had an algorithm that was\nused just to resolve conflicts.","start":1523.16,"duration":5.49},{"text":"It's very simple like major reporting and\nfrom that we were able to label about a thousand","start":1528.65,"duration":9.73},{"text":"hashtags.","start":1538.38,"duration":1.44},{"text":"And so from those hashtags\u2026","start":1539.82,"duration":1.84},{"text":"So just to be clear, you labelled those hashtags\nas liberal or conservative essentially?","start":1541.66,"duration":5.15},{"text":"Yes.","start":1546.81,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Based on what they co-occurred with?","start":1547.81,"duration":1.73},{"text":"Yes.","start":1549.54,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So after that, we looked into tweets.","start":1550.54,"duration":1.97},{"text":"So we built a graph of relationship between\nusers, for example, if user A replied to or","start":1552.51,"duration":7.29},{"text":"retweet another user\u2019s link, we group them.","start":1559.8,"duration":5.11},{"text":"So we built graphs of users and we had to\nlook as a kind of the hashtags they use.","start":1564.91,"duration":6.38},{"text":"So we tried to predict whether a person is\nliberal or conservative and then we used some","start":1571.29,"duration":6.74},{"text":"graph algorithms to detect communities and\nthen we looked at those communities and checked","start":1578.03,"duration":6.69},{"text":"whether this community had much more conservative\nthan liberal members.","start":1584.72,"duration":6.24},{"text":"It was really fascinating because what we\nfound out was that\u2026.","start":1590.96,"duration":3.96},{"text":"About 50% of the communities we found are\nneutral, like there\u2019s a difference between","start":1594.92,"duration":9.29},{"text":"the number of conservatives or liberals is\nnot that high.","start":1604.21,"duration":3.45},{"text":"But then about 25% of them are conservative\nversus the number of conservative members","start":1607.66,"duration":5.79},{"text":"are like more than three times higher than\nDemocrats and this is 25 percent Democrat","start":1613.45,"duration":6.14},{"text":"Communities.","start":1619.59,"duration":1.53},{"text":"So you found the echo chambers?","start":1621.12,"duration":4.63},{"text":"I'm not sure I would say echo chamber but\nI just feel like people who share similar","start":1625.75,"duration":7.9},{"text":"beliefs definitely have stronger ties with\npeople with different feelings.","start":1633.65,"duration":6.36},{"text":"I see.","start":1640.01,"duration":2.39},{"text":"So then were you suggesting to sort of like\nspread information between these communities","start":1642.4,"duration":4.83},{"text":"or...?","start":1647.23,"duration":1.37},{"text":"We never had access to that because it would\nrequire having such a strong social network,","start":1648.6,"duration":8.25},{"text":"but we would have ideas.","start":1656.85,"duration":1.4},{"text":"So we ran to some literature and they say\nthat if you actually show somebody perhaps","start":1658.25,"duration":9.59},{"text":"a news article with an opposite point of view\nfrom their beliefs, they're going to ignore","start":1667.84,"duration":6.98},{"text":"it.","start":1674.82,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So if you believe in a show and saw the opposite\nof it, you\u2019d only be like, \u201coh, just fake","start":1675.82,"duration":3.87},{"text":"news\u201d, right?","start":1679.69,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So you actually have to slowly show them a\nsimilar news article but with a slightly different","start":1680.69,"duration":4.59},{"text":"point of view.","start":1685.28,"duration":1.73},{"text":"You can't give people a totally opposite viewpoint\nand expect people to listen to it.","start":1687.01,"duration":6.86},{"text":"I see.","start":1693.87,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That makes sense.","start":1694.87,"duration":1.17},{"text":"So we never had a chance to test an algorithm\nbut we thought that detecting echo chambers","start":1696.04,"duration":7.46},{"text":"maybe a first step in finding a way to break\nthem up.","start":1703.5,"duration":4.03},{"text":"I see.","start":1707.53,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1708.53,"duration":1.0},{"text":"A lot of people just want to live in their\necho chambers [laughs]","start":1709.53,"duration":5.11},{"text":"I think that Silicon Valley is a massive echo\nchamber, really.","start":1714.64,"duration":5.0},{"text":"I think we all live in the bubble and I feel\nlike somehow this pandemic has made me realize","start":1719.64,"duration":10.84},{"text":"how different our bubble is and how strong\nit is.","start":1730.48,"duration":3.96},{"text":"The other question I wanted to ask you about\nis you've recently gone from a bigger company","start":1734.44,"duration":8.37},{"text":"to a start-up, which is a little bit of a\nshift.","start":1742.81,"duration":3.49},{"text":"Has there been any surprises there?","start":1746.3,"duration":2.74},{"text":"How does that feel to go from, big company\nto start-up?","start":1749.04,"duration":4.02},{"text":"Was that a big cultural shift or...?","start":1753.06,"duration":3.08},{"text":"It\u2019s a big difference.","start":1756.14,"duration":1.28},{"text":"It\u2019s such a big difference and it's just\nwhat I wanted.","start":1757.42,"duration":9.8},{"text":"I thought that after graduation I would like\nto try a different working environment to","start":1767.22,"duration":5.92},{"text":"see which one I would like.","start":1773.14,"duration":2.1},{"text":"So leaving NVIDIA was not a reflection on\nNVIDIA, it was just a reflection on myself,","start":1775.24,"duration":5.27},{"text":"because I just wanted a change.","start":1780.51,"duration":3.44},{"text":"And my co-workers at NVIDIA have been really,\nreally, helpful.","start":1783.95,"duration":4.31},{"text":"And, um, they're really great.","start":1788.26,"duration":2.56},{"text":"So it was a big shock to join a start-up.","start":1790.82,"duration":5.81},{"text":"The first I think, is the workload is so much\nmore; which is a good thing.So you know at","start":1796.63,"duration":10.66},{"text":"a big company, you might be leaving work at\nlike 5, 6:00pm but at a start-up, you might","start":1807.29,"duration":9.82},{"text":"have P.R requests at like midnight on Saturday,\nright?","start":1817.11,"duration":4.34},{"text":"Which is not a bad thing\u2026","start":1821.45,"duration":4.04},{"text":"I don't know.I think I'm just still very ambivalent\nabout one's work-life balance discussions,","start":1825.49,"duration":7.98},{"text":"you know.","start":1833.47,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So some people say, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t work\non the weekends\u201d or \u201cNo company should","start":1834.47,"duration":5.85},{"text":"expect its employees to work on a Saturday\nevening.\u201d","start":1840.32,"duration":4.73},{"text":"As much as companies may not expect you, it\nisn't what they expect of you as much as what","start":1845.05,"duration":4.521},{"text":"we expect out of ourselves.","start":1849.571,"duration":5.339},{"text":"I don't want you to promote the pressure of\nworking too hard but I do believe that when","start":1854.91,"duration":6.47},{"text":"you leave careers, there are certain compromises\nyou might have to make, which depends on what","start":1861.38,"duration":6.5},{"text":"you want out of life.","start":1867.88,"duration":2.17},{"text":"Anyways, there's a very roundabout way of\nsaying that I work on weekends.","start":1870.05,"duration":6.54},{"text":"[Both laugh]","start":1876.59,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It sounds like you're enjoying that experience.","start":1877.59,"duration":4.68},{"text":"I also don't have much of a life, you know,\nso...","start":1882.27,"duration":2.04},{"text":"I guess right now there's less going on, yeah","start":1884.31,"duration":7.08},{"text":"So yes, it\u2019s a big shock that people work\non the weekends.","start":1891.39,"duration":5.8},{"text":"I think I like it.","start":1897.19,"duration":2.2},{"text":"I'm not sure how much longer I would like\nit for because I also heard that when you","start":1899.39,"duration":4.12},{"text":"have family, like for you guys, I heard you\nhad a baby recently.","start":1903.51,"duration":3.72},{"text":"Congratulations!","start":1907.23,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1908.23,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Do you still work on the weekends?","start":1909.23,"duration":3.31},{"text":"I don't think I have a very strong point of\nview.","start":1912.54,"duration":6.2},{"text":"I feel like it's a little bit weird to tell\npeople not to work super hard.","start":1918.74,"duration":4.14},{"text":"Like, I worked incredibly hard in my 20s and.","start":1922.88,"duration":3.89},{"text":"I kind of like to imagine that hard work pays\noff.","start":1926.77,"duration":3.45},{"text":"I feel proud of the stuff that I did.","start":1930.22,"duration":5.64},{"text":"I think you did a great job.","start":1935.86,"duration":4.86},{"text":"I mean, I\u2019ve heard you have done a lot of\ngreat things.","start":1940.72,"duration":6.82},{"text":"I\u2019m a fan.","start":1947.54,"duration":1.4},{"text":"Oh thank you.","start":1948.94,"duration":1.81},{"text":"In the best situation, working really hard\ncan be incredibly fun like for me.","start":1950.75,"duration":4.43},{"text":"So I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019d rather run a\ncompany than, you know, work for someone else,","start":1955.18,"duration":6.21},{"text":"that\u2019s my particular point of view.","start":1961.39,"duration":2.13},{"text":"But for me, working really hard, can be like\na real joy.","start":1963.52,"duration":5.04},{"text":"Like when I started my second company, one\nof the really fun things for me was that it","start":1968.56,"duration":5.331},{"text":"actually made sense for me to pull an all-nighter\nonce in a while, allow it to happen.","start":1973.891,"duration":4.849},{"text":"Really?","start":1978.74,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Do you still pull all-nighters?","start":1979.74,"duration":1.49},{"text":"No, now I have a baby so I have a different\nkind of all-nighter.","start":1981.23,"duration":8.79},{"text":"[Both laugh] I think that the important thing\nis that the company is trying to do something","start":1990.02,"duration":8.24},{"text":"and figuring out how to do it over the long\nterm is the important thing and it needs to","start":1998.26,"duration":7.3},{"text":"be at a sustainable pace because if you work\nhard and burnout, that's super counterproductive.","start":2005.56,"duration":6.6},{"text":"But I don't always think that burnout actually\ncomes from working hard.","start":2012.16,"duration":4.16},{"text":"I think burnout comes more from like working\nhard at things that seem pointless or not","start":2016.32,"duration":3.59},{"text":"seeing the success that you wanted.","start":2019.91,"duration":2.59},{"text":"Yeah.","start":2022.5,"duration":1.29},{"text":"That makes sense.","start":2023.79,"duration":2.0},{"text":"So I think for me I see people working on\nthe weekends doing better and like me I also","start":2025.79,"duration":6.76},{"text":"like working on the weekends because I feel\nmotivated, because I really like what I do","start":2032.55,"duration":5.1},{"text":"and I have faith in it and I also want to\ncontribute.","start":2037.65,"duration":2.66},{"text":"Like if on a Saturday night I could stay at\nhome and watch some I don\u2019t know, like the","start":2040.31,"duration":5.16},{"text":"bachelor.","start":2045.47,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I don't know what people seem to be watching\nor I could just go on Github and check out","start":2046.47,"duration":7.75},{"text":"some P.Rs.","start":2054.22,"duration":1.54},{"text":"I know that sounds like a horrible analogy,\nbut yeah.","start":2055.76,"duration":4.83},{"text":"I feel motivated.","start":2060.59,"duration":1.03},{"text":"So okay.","start":2061.62,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Anyway, back to the question, the first thing\nI noticed was the different workload.","start":2062.62,"duration":8.059},{"text":"And I feel okay to work on the weekends because\nI also get to talk to my co-workers on the","start":2070.679,"duration":7.231},{"text":"weekend and I like it.","start":2077.91,"duration":2.69},{"text":"Then there\u2019s a very simple understanding\nbecause I think everyone knows that some people","start":2080.6,"duration":5.579},{"text":"work on the weekends and it gives them more\nflexibility.","start":2086.179,"duration":1.431},{"text":"Like if you work on the weekday and you feel\nburned out and tired, you can take a day or","start":2087.61,"duration":5.569},{"text":"two off during the week, it\u2019s fine as well.","start":2093.179,"duration":4.371},{"text":"And so this understanding is in consideration\nwhile making the schedule as it will be unnecessary","start":2097.55,"duration":3.66},{"text":"for us to follow a typical five-day workweek\nand I work on the weekdays and then take the","start":2101.21,"duration":7.23},{"text":"weekend off.","start":2108.44,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I think the second thing is the exposure I\nhave to the entire stack.","start":2109.44,"duration":5.79},{"text":"So working in a big company, I was focused\non very specific products and shielded away","start":2115.23,"duration":5.59},{"text":"from aspects like QA or client but at a start-up,\nI get the chance to see everything and we","start":2120.82,"duration":10.83},{"text":"sort of built it from scratch.","start":2131.65,"duration":2.0},{"text":"So I'm exposed to the decisions that we have\nto make; like what\u2019s the tool to use or","start":2133.65,"duration":7.14},{"text":"how to structure the repo.","start":2140.79,"duration":1.58},{"text":"For example, do you want a modern repo or\ndo you want a very small repo?","start":2142.37,"duration":5.739},{"text":"So a recent decision is what tools to use\nbecause when you join a big company, usually","start":2148.109,"duration":5.211},{"text":"you had to use standard tools and someone\nhas decided for you but at a start-up, you","start":2153.32,"duration":6.14},{"text":"have a say in choosing the tools which expose\nyou to various problems as well.","start":2159.46,"duration":4.3},{"text":"So I really like it.","start":2163.76,"duration":1.3},{"text":"And also, of course, there\u2019s the size at\na big company.","start":2165.06,"duration":5.44},{"text":"There are a lot of people and I think it\u2019s\nnice that at a big company, you have access","start":2170.5,"duration":4.3},{"text":"to a lot of people but at a start-up, you\nhave only a small number of colleagues so","start":2174.8,"duration":4.39},{"text":"you can\u2019t send a message to somebody from\nanother team because all you have are just","start":2179.19,"duration":6.09},{"text":"the people on the team.","start":2185.28,"duration":2.19},{"text":"Cool.","start":2187.47,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Makes sense.","start":2188.47,"duration":1.07},{"text":"So I think we\u2019ve gone a bit overtime but\nwe always end with two questions, really kind","start":2189.54,"duration":7.36},{"text":"of curious to hear your takes on these.","start":2196.9,"duration":2.54},{"text":"So the first question is, what is a topic\nin machine learning that you think people","start":2199.44,"duration":8.11},{"text":"don't talk enough about or is an underrated\ntopic that people should talk about more,","start":2207.55,"duration":6.38},{"text":"but they don't?","start":2213.93,"duration":1.2},{"text":"So I think you have a list of things I usually\ncarry around.","start":2215.13,"duration":3.88},{"text":"One of them is graph.","start":2219.01,"duration":2.23},{"text":"I love graph and I used to think they were\nunderrated, I tweeted about three years ago","start":2221.24,"duration":8.07},{"text":"about it.","start":2229.31,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But I think that has changed.","start":2230.31,"duration":2.44},{"text":"Like I was at Neurips in

talk","start":371.879,"duration":5.28},{"text":"to a lot of the folks that are working in\nthe field and seeing how they approached some","start":377.159,"duration":2.901},{"text":"of these things as well.","start":380.06,"duration":1.68},{"text":"A lot of the content we put together in that\nclass came from about thirty or forty interviews","start":381.74,"duration":6.06},{"text":"that we did with practitioners and just trying\nto understand.","start":387.8,"duration":3.63},{"text":"We had a good sense of, what are the hard\nthings?","start":391.43,"duration":3.019},{"text":"And what questions do you need to ask if you're\nputting together an applied machine learning","start":394.449,"duration":5.631},{"text":"team.","start":400.08,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So just getting a range of answers on those\nwas also really helpful.","start":401.08,"duration":3.18},{"text":"You know, you have a unique background, having\nbeen like a McKinsey Consultant for a number","start":404.26,"duration":6.18},{"text":"of years.","start":410.44,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Do you think that informs you at all like\nthat?","start":411.44,"duration":2.249},{"text":"Do you think about how that might affect the\nway you approach this stuff?","start":413.689,"duration":3.421},{"text":"I think one of the things I learned from McKinsey\nwas, how do you approach abstract problems?","start":417.11,"duration":6.72},{"text":"Like what should our company do?","start":423.83,"duration":2.0},{"text":"Or, you know, what does your organization\nstructure look like?","start":425.83,"duration":4.571},{"text":"Show like these problems where it's like okay,\nwhere do I even start thinking about this","start":430.401,"duration":7.418},{"text":"problem?","start":437.819,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I think the question like how to make machine\nlearning work in the real world has this flavor","start":438.819,"duration":3.91},{"text":"and then figuring out how to break that down\ninto parts and structure your thinking around","start":442.729,"duration":4.05},{"text":"it is definitely one of the essential things\nthat you have to do as a management consultant.","start":446.779,"duration":5.47},{"text":"And so I think that definitely informed the\nway that I looked at this problem.","start":452.249,"duration":4.791},{"text":"So is there a piece of your curriculum that\nyou feel particularly proud of?","start":457.04,"duration":7.219},{"text":"I think the thing that I put the most, emotional\nenergy into was the troubleshooting guide.","start":464.259,"duration":9.72},{"text":"That is actually my favorite part too.","start":473.979,"duration":2.46},{"text":"That was the piece that I would say I was\nwriting it for myself a few years ago more","start":476.439,"duration":6.28},{"text":"than anything else, because I was just trying\nto answer.. to...","start":482.719,"duration":6.54},{"text":"My perspective when I was writing that was,\n\"how could I have saved myself months of time","start":489.259,"duration":6.19},{"text":"if I had gone and started over in this field?\"","start":495.449,"duration":2.381},{"text":"I would have to say that I got a chance to\nwork for you briefly for maybe a month or","start":497.83,"duration":7.399},{"text":"two and I think my big takeaway from you that\nI always hear in my head is you are like,","start":505.229,"duration":7.451},{"text":"\"You should always slow down and change one\nthing at a time.\"","start":512.68,"duration":4.02},{"text":"I mean, I feel like that actually applies\nto more than machine learning obviously.","start":516.7,"duration":6.11},{"text":"But boy, does it apply to machine learning\nlike Oh my God!","start":522.81,"duration":3.7},{"text":"Yeah.","start":526.51,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It's so essential in machine learning, because\nfundamentally I think the thing that makes","start":527.51,"duration":4.51},{"text":"machine learning so hard is that, when you're\nwriting software, like when you're writing","start":532.02,"duration":5.94},{"text":"code, we have this pretty mature ecosystem\nwhere if you make a mistake, usually the system","start":537.96,"duration":9.1},{"text":"that you're building or that you're interacting\nwith will tell you.","start":547.06,"duration":1.701},{"text":"First of all, will tell you that you made\na mistake.","start":548.761,"duration":2.739},{"text":"And second of all, might even give you a hint\nas to where that mistake is.","start":551.5,"duration":4.08},{"text":"But the insane thing about actually trying\nto make progress on machine learning projects","start":555.58,"duration":4.13},{"text":"is that most of the time when you have a bug,\nthe only thing that happens is that the performance","start":559.71,"duration":5.43},{"text":"of your model doesn't get better as quickly\nas it should.","start":565.14,"duration":4.79},{"text":"And so there's no way of knowing that you\nactually made a mistake a lot of time.","start":569.93,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Unless you happen to have really strong intuition\nabout what your learning curve should look","start":573.43,"duration":4.39},{"text":"like, right?","start":577.82,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And so I feel like that's why it's so essential\nto move slowly when you're building your machine","start":578.82,"duration":5.07},{"text":"learning models.","start":583.89,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Although it's kind of funny because I wonder\nif programming Web applications is the outlier","start":584.89,"duration":7.56},{"text":"here, because I think about just trying to\nmake an advertising campaign work well or","start":592.45,"duration":5.31},{"text":"trying to get my old motorcycle running again,\nit's always better to change one thing.","start":597.76,"duration":6.84},{"text":"Yeah.","start":604.6,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Because it's so hard to tell what will happen\notherwise.","start":605.6,"duration":1.1},{"text":"But I guess maybe we have this better telemetry\nor API, you know, programming python or if","start":606.7,"duration":7.32},{"text":"I don't know...","start":614.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I feel like that's right.","start":615.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I mean, I wouldn't consider myself a world\nclass web developer, but when I've done it,","start":616.02,"duration":5.09},{"text":"it's also been helpful to still just change\none thing at a time.","start":621.11,"duration":2.89},{"text":"I just feel like it's just good advice for\nall situations.","start":624.0,"duration":2.58},{"text":"Yyeah, it might be.","start":626.58,"duration":1.06},{"text":"Anytime you're building anything, I feel like\nas you get better at something you can increase","start":627.64,"duration":4.64},{"text":"the increment of what you can change at a\ntime.","start":632.28,"duration":3.75},{"text":"For example, if I'm training an image classifier\nor something, I can pretty much just start","start":636.03,"duration":5.31},{"text":"with newer architecture, like a resonant or\nsomething like that, because I've done that","start":641.34,"duration":7.45},{"text":"enough times that I

feel like I can skip a couple of steps\nbut when I'm writing Kubernetes Code, right?","start":656.28,"duration":6.79},{"text":"Something I'm not very much good at, I have\nto still move very, very slowly.","start":663.07,"duration":5.27},{"text":"Would you be down to walk me through your\ntroubleshooting steps and how you think about","start":668.34,"duration":4.57},{"text":"them, I know a few people will be interested.","start":672.91,"duration":2.21},{"text":"Yeah.","start":675.12,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You know, the core concept is what we've been\ntalking about, right?","start":676.12,"duration":1.98},{"text":"Which is to start simple and then layer on\ncomplexity one step at a time.","start":678.1,"duration":4.65},{"text":"So the first question you might have is what\ndoes it mean to start simple, right?","start":682.75,"duration":4.25},{"text":"I think that one of things I've noticed with\npeople that are getting to the field is that","start":687.0,"duration":5.88},{"text":"there's a tendency to get all this excitement\naround neural network architectures and the","start":692.88,"duration":6.76},{"text":"latest and greatest state-of-the-art model\non image net.","start":699.64,"duration":6.67},{"text":"And so I think people tend to overthink the\nquestion of architecture selection and selection","start":706.31,"duration":6.64},{"text":"of all the other pieces around that; like\nwhat Optimizer are you using and things like","start":712.95,"duration":3.04},{"text":"that.","start":715.99,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But in reality, I think when you're starting\non a new project, the goal is to just choose","start":716.99,"duration":3.65},{"text":"a reasonable default and start there, even\nif it's not state-of-the-art.","start":720.64,"duration":5.39},{"text":"And then once you've convinced yourself that\neverything around that is working, it's your","start":726.03,"duration":4.11},{"text":"data loading code and your training code and\nall that stuff, then you can gradually move","start":730.14,"duration":6.05},{"text":"closer to a state-of-the-art architecture.","start":736.19,"duration":1.95},{"text":"How do you convince yourself that this stuff\nis all working?","start":738.14,"duration":3.44},{"text":"Yeah, it's a hard question.","start":741.58,"duration":2.98},{"text":"I think there's some tricks that you can use,\nright?","start":744.56,"duration":3.61},{"text":"So the first thing that I recommend people\ndo when you're training a new neural net for","start":748.17,"duration":7.0},{"text":"the first time is just make sure that you\ncan first.","start":755.17,"duration":3.38},{"text":"I mean, first of all, just get the thing to\nrun.","start":758.55,"duration":2.78},{"text":"Right.","start":761.33,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Like, literally just like output something","start":762.33,"duration":1.56},{"text":"Just output anything.","start":763.89,"duration":1.06},{"text":"Which is not always as easy as it should be.","start":764.95,"duration":3.33},{"text":"Let's say that you've done that.","start":768.28,"duration":2.18},{"text":"Then the next thing that I think you usually\nwant to do is try to overfit a really small","start":770.46,"duration":5.13},{"text":"amount of data; like a single batch of data.","start":775.59,"duration":4.47},{"text":"It seems really simple and a lot of people\nskip over that stuff because of that.","start":780.06,"duration":3.93},{"text":"And, you know, 80% of the time, it's not really\nnecessary, but 20% of the time you can catch","start":783.99,"duration":4.83},{"text":"some pretty nasty bugs early on.","start":788.82,"duration":2.3},{"text":"So, I often recommend this, citing you, and\nI'm sure that this is not obvious to most","start":791.12,"duration":8.37},{"text":"people, why do you want to overfit a small\namount of data?","start":799.49,"duration":5.15},{"text":"So like any reasonable model architecture,\noptimizer, training loop and data type, you","start":804.64,"duration":8.07},{"text":"know, you should be able to get your loss\ndown to zero on a single batch of data, right?","start":812.71,"duration":4.08},{"text":"You have enough parameters of the neural net,\nshould be able to just memorize the data.","start":816.79,"duration":5.27},{"text":"And so, you know, basically if it can't do\nthat, then you know that you must have like","start":822.06,"duration":4.111},{"text":"a pretty bad bug in one of those things.","start":826.171,"duration":2.779},{"text":"What kind of bug, for example?","start":828.95,"duration":2.24},{"text":"Like you flip the sign on your loss function,\nright?","start":831.19,"duration":2.81},{"text":"And your loss actually goes up rather than\ngoing down.","start":834.0,"duration":2.92},{"text":"Or, another one I see all the time is in a\nlot of these neural network libraries, the","start":836.92,"duration":9.54},{"text":"inputs to the loss function is maybe like\nthe low digits right?","start":846.46,"duration":4.08},{"text":"So it's like something un-normalized.","start":850.54,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But, you know, maybe you took the softmax\nof that first and so it's things like that,","start":851.54,"duration":6.5},{"text":"right?","start":858.04,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Where it's just like you wrote the code the\nwrong way and this is a quick sense check","start":859.04,"duration":6.28},{"text":"for figuring out like, \"Is the code that you're\nrunning reasonable?\"","start":865.32,"duration":4.47},{"text":"Okay.","start":869.79,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Sorry I cut you off.","start":870.79,"duration":1.98},{"text":"Then what do you when you can overfit one\ntiny subset of your data.","start":872.77,"duration":5.05},{"text":"Yeah.","start":877.82,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So when you can overfit a tiny subset of your\ndata...","start":878.82,"duration":1.48},{"text":"Then I would say, one way to think about the\nprocess of making your neural net better and","start":880.3,"duration":7.8},{"text":"better over time is there's like an outer\nloop and then there's an inner loop, right?","start":888.1,"duration":5.2},{"text":"The outer loop is basically you generally\ntrying to do one of two things, you're either","start":893.3,"duration":8.39},{"text":"trying to reduce the amount of underfitting\nthat your neural net has or reduce the amount","start":901.69,"duration":6.95},{"text":"of overfitting that your neural net has.","start":908.64,"duration":2.98},{"text":"And there's a lot of strategies for doing\nboth of those things but the best strategy","start":911.62,"duration":8.71},{"text":"for reducing underfitting is to make your\nmodel bigger and for reducing overfitting","start":920.33,"duration":3.95},{"text":"is to add more data.","start":924.28,"duration":1.24},{"text":"And so if you think about what we just did\nwith overfitting a single batch of data or","start":925.52,"duration":5.03},{"text":"with driving loss down to zero on a single\nbatch of data, we're basically saying, let's","start":930.55,"duration":4.25},{"text":"take the smallest possible dataset and let's\noverfit it, right?","start":934.8,"duration":3.72},{"text":"And so now the next question in your decision\ntree should be, \"All right.","start":938.52,"duration":4.21},{"text":"Now we know that we're overfitting because\nwe can drive loss down to zero.","start":942.73,"duration":5.61},{"text":"So the next thing that we should do is reduce\noverfitting.\"","start":948.34,"duration":2.23},{"text":"And the simplest way to do that is to add\ndata; but you want to do this gradually, right?","start":950.57,"duration":4.66},{"text":"So typically, what I would do next is I would\nmove from a single batch of data to a smaller","start":955.23,"duration":5.63},{"text":"or more simplified version of the dataset\nthat I was working with.","start":960.86,"duration":2.97},{"text":"So maybe it's like, I don't know, maybe it's\na million images, you only take a thousand","start":963.83,"duration":4.91},{"text":"or ten thousand of them to start out with.","start":968.74,"duration":3.39},{"text":"Maybe you make a synthetic sort of toy version\nof the problem that you're working with.","start":972.13,"duration":4.03},{"text":"You know, if you're doing reinforcement learning,\nmaybe you work with one of the standard simple","start":976.16,"duration":6.84},{"text":"benchmark problems like cartpole or something\nlike that.","start":983.0,"duration":5.69},{"text":"And so you just make the problem one step\nmore difficult than a single batch of data.","start":988.69,"duration":5.01},{"text":"I see.","start":993.7,"duration":1.6},{"text":"So you add one piece of complexity?","start":995.3,"duration":3.35},{"text":"Yeah, that's the way I think about it.","start":998.65,"duration":3.27},{"text":"Why wouldn't you just add all the data that\nyou have?","start":1001.92,"duration":4.18},{"text":"Because like your conclusions, I imagine that\ncould change at different scales of data,","start":1006.1,"duration":4.21},{"text":"for example.","start":1010.31,"duration":1.05},{"text":"Yeah, definitely.","start":1011.36,"duration":1.05},{"text":"I think there's two core reasons, right?","start":1012.41,"duration":2.91},{"text":"So one is; a lot of time..","start":1015.32,"duration":5.19},{"text":"I guess maybe the simplest one to explain\nis that it just reduces your iteration time,","start":1020.51,"duration":5.919},{"text":"right?","start":1026.429,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So if you're working with a smaller dataset\nor a simpler dataset, then typically your","start":1027.429,"duration":2.49},{"text":"model will change faster.","start":1029.919,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It'll be cheaper.","start":1030.919,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And so you can just try to output things more\nquickly, which is super key but I think the","start":1031.919,"duration":5.331},{"text":"deeper and more interesting reason is that\na lot of times in machine learning, you're","start":1037.25,"duration":6.64},{"text":"working, you have some degree of confidence\nthat this model should actually be able to","start":1043.89,"duration":7.21},{"text":"solve the task that you're working on but\na lot times you don't actually know that for","start":1051.1,"duration":4.179},{"text":"a fact, right?","start":1055.279,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Like, maybe you're doing image classification,\nbut you are not doing it on image net.","start":1056.279,"duration":3.39},{"text":"You're doing it on some other dataset.","start":1059.669,"duration":2.441},{"text":"Maybe you're classifying whether a person\nis wearing a hat in the image or not.","start":1062.11,"duration":7.23},{"text":"And so it's like intuitively you feel like\nit should be possible to solve this with a","start":1069.34,"duration":3.14},{"text":"neural net, but you don't actually know that\nfor sure.","start":1072.48,"duration":3.73},{"text":"And so you want to try to isolate the sources\nof error in your problem, right?","start":1076.21,"duration":5.62},{"text":"And so if one of the possible sources of error\nis that this data set, it's just too hard,","start":1081.83,"duration":5.19},{"text":"then it makes sense to start with a version\nof the dataset that your model should be able","start":1087.02,"duration":3.94},{"text":"to do well on.","start":1090.96,"duration":1.86},{"text":"And so smaller datasets, less complex datasets\nallow you to do that.","start":1092.82,"duration":4.03},{"text":"But wouldn't a smaller dataset make the problem\nharder?","start":1096.85,"duration":3.09},{"text":"In what sense?","start":1099.94,"duration":1.819},{"text":"Say, I'm trying to classify if someone has\na hat on or not, if I have less training data,","start":1101.759,"duration":5.49},{"text":"I would expect my accuracy to be lower, right?","start":1107.249,"duration":4.761},{"text":"Hmmn.","start":1112.01,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1113.01,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That's certainly true.","start":1114.01,"duration":1.38},{"text":"So I guess this comes back to the overall\nprocess that we're trying to follow, right?","start":1115.39,"duration":7.989},{"text":"I think of it as iterating between eliminating\nunder-fitting and eliminating over-fitting.","start":1123.379,"duration":5.17},{"text":"And so if you're in a situation where your\nmodel is doing perfectly well on your training","start":1128.549,"duration":8.211},{"text":"set, then it makes sense to increase the complexity\nof your training set.","start":1136.76,"duration":4.06},{"text":"If you're in a situation where your model\ncan't do well on your training set, then you","start":1140.82,"duration":5.469},{"text":"need to figure out, is it that my training\ndata is too hard?","start":1146.289,"duration":3.561},{"text":"Is it that I need a bigger model?","start":1149.85,"duration":1.72},{"text":"Is it that I need a different architecture?","start":1151.57,"duration":1.709},{"text":"Is it that I need a different optimizer, different\nhyperparameters?","start":1153.279,"duration":3.931},{"text":"And so, working with a dataset where it's\neasier to get to that point of your model","start":1157.21,"duration":5.9},{"text":"overfitting reduces the number of things that\ncould be wrong with your model.","start":1163.11,"duration":6.159},{"text":"Interesting.","start":1169.269,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Are there more steps to this?","start":1170.269,"duration":2.48},{"text":"I mean, that's the high level flow right,\nyou know, solve your problem, make it harder,","start":1172.749,"duration":6.5},{"text":"solve your problem, make it harder.","start":1179.249,"duration":1.9},{"text":"And then there's details about how to make\neach of those things work well, right?","start":1181.149,"duration":5.611},{"text":"Like, what are the steps you should actually\ntry when you're underfitting and you need","start":1186.76,"duration":5.529},{"text":"make your model more expressive?","start":1192.289,"duration":7.37},{"text":"That's the overall picture.","start":1199.659,"duration":1.9},{"text":"We'll have to put a link to this and some\npeople can find it.","start":1201.559,"duration":5.461},{"text":"Do you plan to teach more of these classes?","start":1207.02,"duration":2.02},{"text":"I think so, yeah.","start":1209.04,"duration":2.239},{"text":"We don't have concrete plans to do another\none.","start":1211.279,"duration":4.331},{"text":"I mean, it's not a great time for in-person\nclasses.","start":1215.61,"duration":5.37},{"text":"Maybe a virtual one..","start":1220.98,"duration":13.76},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1234.74,"duration":11.24},{"text":"Maybe a virtual one.","start":1245.98,"duration":17.71},{"text":"That could be fun.","start":1263.69,"duration":59.43},{"text":"Do you have any advice I suppose to folks\nwanting to get into machine learning?","start":1323.12,"duration":5.039},{"text":"I'm sure you probably watch a lot of students\nlearn it or not learn it.","start":1328.159,"duration":4.38},{"text":"Do they have any sense of what's required?","start":1332.539,"duration":3.96},{"text":"Some people look at something like machine\nlearning and they say, \"OK.","start":1336.499,"duration":4.001},{"text":"This is a really deep field and there is a\nlot to learn

really","start":1772.94,"duration":7.579},{"text":"concrete problem that we were trying to solve.","start":1780.519,"duration":2.951},{"text":"We were trying to set up a robot to make a\nstack of

needed to go back and backfill.","start":1801.35,"duration":1.5},{"text":"Like, how do we actually find out?","start":1802.85,"duration":2.1},{"text":"How do we estimate the position of each of\nthese blocks in the real world?","start":1804.95,"duration":3.67},{"text":"It is something that seems like a really easy\nproblem, but actually when you think about","start":1808.62,"duration":4.271},{"text":"\"how do you make this really work?\", it's\nmore complicated than you'd expect.","start":1812.891,"duration":4.199},{"text":"Honestly, it's so

amazing.","start":1822.889,"duration":1.311},{"text":"That's hard.","start":1824.2,"duration":1.309},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1825.509,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And I think it's not like the hardest research\nproblem in the world, but when you actually","start":1826.509,"duration":5.431},{"text":"sit down and try to go and make it work really\nwell, it's very tricky.","start":1831.94,"duration":4.969},{"text":"Sure.","start":1836.909,"duration":1.051},{"text":"And so we're playing around with these different\ntag, you know, ArUco tags and methods like","start":1837.96,"duration":7.91},{"text":"that where you understand the intrinsics of\na camera and then it reads this tag off of","start":1845.87,"duration":6.769},{"text":"an object and then it can infer the position\nof the objects, given the position of the","start":1852.639,"duration":5.831},{"text":"camera.","start":1858.47,"duration":1.14},{"text":"And we just found those things to be really\nfragile and honestly, not really accurate","start":1859.61,"duration":6.549},{"text":"without investing in expensive setups and\nexpensive camera equipment and stuff

obvious question is, why don't\nyou just train a neural net to do this?","start":1875.269,"duration":5.071},{"text":"You know, train a neural net to take an image\nof a table and then say, \"OK, here's the position","start":1880.34,"duration":4.219},{"text":"of all of the cubes on the table.\"","start":1884.559,"duration":3.24},{"text":"But the problem is that, where do you get\nthe labels

cubes are\nin order to actually get the label dataset","start":1895.279,"duration":5.78},{"text":"that used to train neural net, right?","start":1901.059,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So it's a bit of a chicken and egg problem.","start":1902.059,"duration":2.641},{"text":"And so this is kind of the starting point\nfor me working on this Sim to real problem","start":1904.7,"duration":4.62},{"text":"is like, \"this feels like the simplest possible\nexample of a problem where maybe synthetic","start":1909.32,"duration":6.02},{"text":"data, data from a physics simulator would\nactually help\"","start":1915.34,"duration":3.73},{"text":"So then describe what you did.","start":1919.07,"duration":2.27},{"text":"So the core idea is that if you just take\ndata from a simulator naively and train a","start":1921.34,"duration":5.49},{"text":"model on it, the problem is that there are\nquirks of your simulator, right?","start":1926.83,"duration":4.39},{"text":"Your simulator doesn't perfectly match the\nreal world and so the neural level overfits","start":1931.22,"duration":4.72},{"text":"to any difference between the data in the\nsimulator and the data in the real world.","start":1935.94,"duration":4.189},{"text":"So if you didn't perfectly model the lighting,\nyou didn't perfectly model the color of the","start":1940.129,"duration":5.49},{"text":"cube, the neural net won't transfer.","start":1945.619,"duration":3.381},{"text":"So the idea that we had was what if instead\nof just taking a single best physics simulator,","start":1949.0,"duration":8.619},{"text":"you massively randomize every aspect of the\nsimulator that's not critically important","start":1957.619,"duration":5.581},{"text":"to solving the task?","start":1963.2,"duration":1.14},{"text":"So you randomize the colors of all the objects,\nyou randomize their positions, you randomize","start":1964.34,"duration":6.169},{"text":"the position of the camera, you randomize\nthe background and it produces images that","start":1970.509,"duration":8.16},{"text":"are crazy and unrealistic looking, right?","start":1978.669,"duration":2.82},{"text":"So they look like scenes from an animated\ndisco or something.","start":1981.489,"duration":7.611},{"text":"But what happens is that actually the neural\nnet in learning how to estimate the position","start":1989.1,"duration":7.279},{"text":"of the cube in all of these massively different\nworlds is forced to not rely on the parts","start":1996.379,"duration":8.191},{"text":"of the simulator that are not essential for\nsolving the task.","start":2004.57,"duration":3.43},{"text":"So if the color of the cube changes in every\nsingle data point, then the neural net can't","start":2008.0,"duration":5.58},{"text":"create a feature that depends on the color\nof the cube to solve the task, because that's","start":2013.58,"duration":4.079},{"text":"just an unreliable piece of information.","start":2017.659,"duration":1.9},{"text":"And so when we do this, it turns out that\nyou can train neural nets on entirely simulated","start":2019.559,"duration":5.261},{"text":"data.","start":2024.82,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So no real world data at all, they actually\nwork when they're deployed in the real world.","start":2025.82,"duration":4.549},{"text":"Because you just cycle through lots of colors\nand shadows and other...","start":2030.369,"duration":7.38},{"text":"Yeah, exactly.","start":2037.749,"duration":1.721},{"text":"Exactly.","start":2039.47,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You basically show the neural net every color\nand every shadow that it could possibly see.","start":2040.47,"duration":9.81},{"text":"And so then in order to solve the task, it\nneeds to learn that colors and shadows, are","start":2050.28,"duration":6.04},{"text":"not important; what's important is the position\nof this cube-looking thing on the table.","start":2056.32,"duration":6.099},{"text":"And so it's not overfitting to like all the\ndetails that are unimportant and so if the","start":2062.419,"duration":8.581},{"text":"details that it is looking at are the ones\nthat hopefully will transfer over when it's","start":2071.0,"duration":3.659},{"text":"deployed in the real world.","start":2074.659,"duration":1.101},{"text":"So how far can this generalize, has this been\napplied to more than second blocks now?","start":2075.76,"duration":7.139},{"text":"Yeah, it's been applied to a pretty wide range\nof computer vision and robotics tasks at this","start":2082.899,"duration":7.27},{"text":"point.","start":2090.169,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I think it's been applied to..","start":2091.169,"duration":3.581},{"text":"My favorite random application was there was\na paper about using domain randomization to","start":2094.75,"duration":4.96},{"text":"train a robot to

is actually a really hard task because\nfish are very shiny and slippery.","start":2109.309,"duration":3.901},{"text":"And in general, most object detection methods,\ncomputer vision stuff has trouble with objects","start":2113.21,"duration":6.909},{"text":"that have a lot of reflections and things\nlike that.","start":2120.119,"duration":3.381},{"text":"So that's my favorite random

of\ncomputer vision problems.","start":2129.98,"duration":5.069},{"text":"And I think the furthest this idea has been\npushed was at Open AI when they used

of a stunt or is this like a\nreal deep task?","start":2157.76,"duration":3.95},{"text":"Where do you land on that?","start":2161.71,"duration":3.32},{"text":"So maybe the different sides of this

a whole history of\nairplane crash investigations and regulations","start":819.02,"duration":4.93},{"text":"and so forth.","start":823.95,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So it's not that driverless cars or

there","start":883.15,"duration":4.68},{"text":"is some sort of informal cooperation going\non among those developers.","start":887.83,"duration":4.85},{"text":"Though, it's kind of tricky due to

that.","start":950.31,"duration":4.06},{"text":"But I'd say that if you look across AI, there\nare areas that are more and less return on","start":954.37,"duration":6.719},{"text":"the rigor that people are applying.","start":961.089,"duration":4.751},{"text":"I guess it seems to me like more of the AI's\nindustry does come out of more of a

like there's a fair amount\nof cooperation at least on the technology","start":988.72,"duration":5.36},{"text":"side, like maybe more than you'd

how\nlong that will last and what are the underlying","start":1000.36,"duration":4.84},{"text":"drivers of that openness?","start":1005.2,"duration":2.15},{"text":"One argument for why it might be more open\nthan you might otherwise expect is just that","start":1007.35,"duration":4.9},{"text":"individual AI researchers want to publish\nstuff and therefore that puts pressure on","start":1012.25,"duration":5.52},{"text":"the companies that hire those people to allow\nthem to publish stuff.","start":1017.77,"duration":4.72},{"text":"And I think that's a very strong incentive.","start":1022.49,"duration":1.949},{"text":"And the fact that AI researchers are sort\nof a scarce resource in the talent market,","start":1024.439,"duration":6.611},{"text":"that gives them some influence over what the\npolicies are at these companies.","start":1031.05,"duration":4.759},{"text":"And there's also something, another argument\nfor why it might be so open, is that it can","start":1035.809,"duration":4.191},{"text":"benefit the companies to be open by getting\npeople to use their frameworks and they can","start":1040.0,"duration":3.923},{"text":"make it easier to hire people in the future.","start":1043.923,"duration":2.817},{"text":"But I wouldn't want us to rest on our laurels\nhere.","start":1046.74,"duration":5.31},{"text":"And that's why, for example, in a report that\nmy colleagues and I put out recently, we talked","start":1052.05,"duration":5.56},{"text":"about the need for more generously supporting\nacademics with computing resource, because","start":1057.61,"duration":5.1},{"text":"we don't necessarily want to just assume that\nthose in industry will continue to release","start":1062.71,"duration":7.77},{"text":"products and that forever there will be that\npressure from below to get these releases","start":1070.48,"duration":5.75},{"text":"because there could also be cases where suddenly\nthere's a huge commercial potential that's","start":1076.23,"duration":4.6},{"text":"identified and a company is sort of closed\nup.","start":1080.83,"duration":3.89},{"text":"Or at an international level, there's pressure\ndue to

changed in the last five years,\nI think we need to start thinking about what","start":1102.15,"duration":3.06},{"text":"are the policy that can you get away?","start":1105.21,"duration":3.14},{"text":"You were actually talking about, I think,\na paper you just recently published that talks","start":1108.35,"duration":5.82},{"text":"about AI

authors.","start":1129.28,"duration":2.91},{"text":"So it was super collaborative.","start":1132.19,"duration":1.9},{"text":"Got it.","start":1134.09,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Cool.","start":1135.09,"duration":1.0},{"text":"One thing I thought was that it was a provocative\ntitle - Mechanisms for Supporting

maybe","start":1145.77,"duration":4.11},{"text":"you could share the thinking behind that.","start":1149.88,"duration":1.38},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1151.26,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So the basic idea in that report is that AI\ndevelopers are making all sorts of systems","start":1152.26,"duration":6.5},{"text":"and they want to sell them or they want people\nto use them.","start":1158.76,"duration":3.99},{"text":"And they make various claims about these systems\nlike we did bias analysis or they're robust","start":1162.75,"duration":4.88},{"text":"in X, Y and Z ways.","start":1167.63,"duration":2.549},{"text":"And there are some claims like that that are\nrelatively easy to verify.","start":1170.179,"duration":3.991},{"text":"Like, if you're in the case where it's an\nopen source system, you might be able, if","start":1174.17,"duration":4.79},{"text":"you have some technical expertise, to replicate\nthe results, reproduce a certain error rate","start":1178.96,"duration":6.17},{"text":"and verify that these AI developers are telling\nthe truth.","start":1185.13,"duration":3.94},{"text":"But there are other cases where it's not as\nobvious how to do that.","start":1189.07,"duration":3.09},{"text":"For example, if it's a very computing-intensive\nsystem, it might be harder for academics to","start":1192.16,"duration":4.59},{"text":"scrutinize it.","start":1196.75,"duration":1.74},{"text":"Or if there are claims being made about privacy\npreservation, but there's this new fancy

developers.","start":1216.43,"duration":4.58},{"text":"So what we did in this report is try and take\na very broad 30,000 foot view of like, \"OK,","start":1221.01,"duration":5.47},{"text":"what is the problem here?\"","start":1226.48,"duration":1.54},{"text":"And we broke it down into institution, software\nand hardware as the three elements of an

think that's one","start":2406.99,"duration":4.41},{"text":"of the more naive uses that you can do.","start":2411.4,"duration":4.419},{"text":"But that depends on a very high level of performance\nand the right kind of space where you don't","start":2415.819,"duration":4.811},{"text":"need online monitoring.","start":2420.63,"duration":1.489},{"text":"But I think there's also other cases

if you're able to get humans in the loop\nto provide feedback on these systems and choose","start":2431.999,"duration":4.921},{"text":"among a few initial outputs, both for beneficial\nand malicious

this is the question that I've always had\nabout OpenAI.","start":2472.349,"duration":5.101},{"text":"If you don't mind, I'm kind of curious.","start":2477.45,"duration":3.819},{"text":"OpenAI's

me.","start":2486.319,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah.","start":2487.319,"duration":1.0},{"text":"The shorthand version is build artificial\ngeneral intelligence and use it to help everyone.","start":2488.319,"duration":6.641},{"text":"It seems like a funny mix of policy and building.","start":2494.96,"duration":7.19},{"text":"Do you think it's important that those two\nthings are together?","start":2502.15,"duration":3.449},{"text":"How would you argue against this?","start":2505.599,"duration":3.171},{"text":"Because I think that they should go together\nbut I'm trying to think from the other point","start":2508.77,"duration":10.989},{"text":"of view.","start":2519.759,"duration":2.53},{"text":"Does policy and building really necessarily\nneed to be combined?","start":2522.289,"duration":3.861},{"text":"Is it even combined in most cases?","start":2526.15,"duration":2.0},{"text":"Because it feels like the policymakers in\ngeneral, aren't always

default, a lot of people who are\nbuilding powerful technologies are 'de facto'","start":2539.049,"duration":6.881},{"text":"policymakers and that they're setting the\ndefault and how people think of things and","start":2545.93,"duration":5.029},{"text":"they're influencing what the early applications\nare and so forth.","start":2550.959,"duration":3.14},{"text":"So I think you can't totally separate them.","start":2554.099,"duration":1.821},{"text":"I think anyone who's involved in technology\nshould be thinking to some extent about other","start":2555.92,"duration":4.52},{"text":"social impact.","start":2560.44,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And, you know, there's also value to division\nof labor and that's why not every single person","start":2561.44,"duration":5.369},{"text":"in the organization is on the policy team.","start":2566.809,"duration":4.681},{"text":"We have various different teams.","start":2571.49,"duration":2.48},{"text":"So it makes sense to have some specialization.","start":2573.97,"duration":2.2},{"text":"But I think the reason we think it's such\na high priority is that we don't see the impact","start":2576.17,"duration":6.27},{"text":"of AI as reducible exclusively to the design\nof the technology.","start":2582.44,"duration":3.339},{"text":"It's also about what sorts of policies are\nthere to constrain the use of

of people.","start":2599.22,"duration":1.69},{"text":"So we think that it's not just a matter of\nbuilding the technology but also making sure","start":2600.91,"duration":4.139},{"text":"that it happens at the right time in the right\nenvironment with the right infrastructure.","start":2605.049,"duration":3.491},{"text":"So that's why we invest a lot in advocating\nfor policy changes that we

in","start":2627.479,"duration":5.86},{"text":"AI don't seem very controversial to me.","start":2633.339,"duration":2.541},{"text":"It seems like people want fairness and they\nwant openness and transparency.","start":2635.88,"duration":5.8},{"text":"And these things all seem like sensible, wonderful\nthings to me.","start":2641.68,"duration":6.569},{"text":"But I guess where there are

definitely are.","start":2657.329,"duration":1.551},{"text":"So I'm not sure I'd say factions, because\nI try to build bridges and stuff like that,","start":2658.88,"duration":5.969},{"text":"but they're definitely differences in emphasis\nbetween people who are focused on immediate","start":2664.849,"duration":5.811},{"text":"ethical concerns around things like bias and\nsurveillance which are on one end of the spectrum,","start":2670.66,"duration":5.329},{"text":"or multiple spectra, but that's one end of\none spectrum.","start":2675.989,"duration":3.84},{"text":"And on the other end is people who think existential\nrisk from AI systems that are too powerful","start":2679.829,"duration":6.15},{"text":"to control unless you've thought really hard\nabout it in advance, then you by

and thinking about [prison] systems\nand AGI.","start":2705.299,"duration":4.961},{"text":"And I think in terms of fact, it's ultimately\nlike both sides are just trying to figure","start":2710.26,"duration":8.23},{"text":"out how to make sure this technology helps\npeople and doesn't hurt people.","start":2718.49,"duration":4.529},{"text":"And in fact, often, the conclusions in terms\nof the actual policy you recommend aren't","start":2723.019,"duration":4.75},{"text":"that different, depending on whether you're\nfocused on the immediate term or the long","start":2727.769,"duration":3.59},{"text":"term.","start":2731.359,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I see it more as a spectrum, but there are\ndefinitely people with different emphasis.","start":2732.359,"duration":6.26},{"text":"I feel like if the ethics is interesting,\nit must have, there must be controversy.","start":2738.619,"duration":5.571},{"text":"There've been decisions internal to OpenAI\neven to philosophical discussions where people","start":2744.19,"duration":6.48},{"text":"really take strong and different stances.","start":2750.67,"duration":1.649},{"text":"Because I think when you put it in this general\nsense, it's like who would argue that we shouldn't","start":2752.319,"duration":7.861},{"text":"make AI safe and who would argue that we shouldn't\nmake AI biased?","start":2760.18,"duration":3.6},{"text":"But I have a feeling when you zoom in on what\nthat really means, there must be points where","start":2763.78,"duration":6.459},{"text":"they come into conflict.","start":2770.239,"duration":1.75},{"text":"Yeah.","start":2771.989,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Oh yeah.","start":2772.989,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And to be clear, you had asked me about factions,\nso I tried to give you a map of factions but","start":2773.989,"duration":4.78},{"text":"I think there's also, within the factions,\nall sorts of debates and I know that they're","start":2778.769,"duration":6.821},{"text":"not consensus actions.","start":2785.59,"duration":2.239},{"text":"So, yeah, like I said, let us take the short\nterm issues.","start":2787.829,"duration":3.69},{"text":"So I think among the people who are focused\non short-term issues, there is another spectrum","start":2791.519,"duration":6.77},{"text":"of people who on the one end are thinking,\n\"We have to figure out how to do this right","start":2798.289,"duration":6.52},{"text":"and in each case figure out what the right\nnorms are,\" and they see it being both intrinsically","start":2804.809,"duration":6.581},{"text":"important and symbolically important to get\nissues like bias and so forth, sorted out","start":2811.39,"duration":4.119},{"text":"as soon as possible.","start":2815.509,"duration":2.05},{"text":"They're like hardcore, like, \"let's make sure\nthat we're not causing harm\".","start":2817.559,"duration":5.641},{"text":"Like maybe the Hippocratic Oath end of the\nspectrum; first do no harm and take stuff","start":2823.2,"duration":4.5},{"text":"like bias super seriously.","start":2827.7,"duration":1.74},{"text":"And there are also lots of people who are\nbuilding systems that are focused on getting","start":2829.44,"duration":7.149},{"text":"products to market and they're focused on\nreleasing systems that can inform research.","start":2836.589,"duration":4.171},{"text":"And in the case of GPT-2, there was potentially\na tension between avoiding causing harm on","start":2840.76,"duration":9.55},{"text":"the one hand and enabling people to understand\nour research and verify our claims and build","start":2850.31,"duration":5.41},{"text":"a new system.","start":2855.72,"duration":1.08},{"text":"And so you could maybe say, like Hippocratic\nOath end of the spectrum, and then Move Fast","start":2856.8,"duration":5.969},{"text":"and Break Things end of the spectrum.","start":2862.769,"duration":1.281},{"text":"I think there's an element of truth in both\nof them; the harming people on the one hand","start":2864.05,"duration":6.069},{"text":"and also that this technology needs to be\niterated and there needs to be publication","start":2870.119,"duration":6.14},{"text":"and models getting out there in the world\nin order for there to be learning by doing","start":2876.259,"duration":5.76},{"text":"and ultimately figuring out how to solve those\nproblems.","start":2882.019,"duration":3.651},{"text":"So, yeah, definitely.","start":2885.67,"duration":3.649},{"text":"You could see conflicts there.","start":2889.319,"duration":1.42},{"text":"And in the case of GPT-2 there were definitely\na bunch of different perspectives internally","start":2890.739,"duration":4.13},{"text":"at OpenAI and ultimately, we tried to wrangle\nthat into a consensus view.","start":2894.869,"duration":4.621},{"text":"But you can see the ambiguity and the fact\nthat we were hedging a lot of our claims like,","start":2899.49,"duration":4.879},{"text":"\"We're not sure how dangerous this is,\" \"We're\ngoing one step at at time\" because there were","start":2904.369,"duration":6.811},{"text":"actual different competing values at stake.","start":2911.18,"duration":6.219},{"text":"I wouldn't say totally Zero-Sum, but there\nwas some Zero-Sumness between avoiding harm","start":2917.399,"duration":6.791},{"text":"if it turned out that GPT-2 was very dangerous\nand allowing people to verify that type of","start":2924.19,"duration":5.46},{"text":"claim.","start":2929.65,"duration":1.1},{"text":"Yeah, that totally makes sense.","start":2930.75,"duration":1.599},{"text":"I think you mentioned that you don't really\nhave a good sense for what all the policies","start":2932.349,"duration":5.841},{"text":"would need to be to..","start":2938.19,"duration":1.44},{"text":"Unlike climate change where it's pretty maybe\nmore clear what the sensible policies are.","start":2939.63,"duration":4.489},{"text":"Are there some policies that you would enact\nif you had control or if you could recommend","start":2944.119,"duration":8.181},{"text":"a few things to say, the U.S. government?","start":2952.3,"duration":3.309},{"text":"What would those things be?","start":2955.609,"duration":1.351},{"text":"Yeah, so some of the stuff that we flagged\nin the Toward Trustworthy AI Development Report,","start":2956.96,"duration":6.74},{"text":"I would definitely consider here.","start":2963.7,"duration":1.46},{"text":"So stuff like compute for academia.","start":2965.16,"duration":2.549},{"text":"I think generally a super, high, level one\npolicy change that I'd like to see is more","start":2967.709,"duration":5.88},{"text":"robust support of academic research including\nnot just compute, but also things like data","start":2973.589,"duration":7.27},{"text":"and just funding for academics so that they're\nnot constantly writing grant applications.","start":2980.859,"duration":7.381},{"text":"I think there are lots of inefficiencies in\nthe way that the American academic system","start":2988.24,"duration":4.039},{"text":"works currently.","start":2992.279,"duration":1.05},{"text":"So, like more long term funding of work in\nareas like security, surveillance privacy","start":2993.329,"duration":7.15},{"text":"would be good, more support for working on\nthings like bias, because I think we're currently","start":3000.479,"duration":7.08},{"text":"in a regime where there's a little bit of\nfunding here from the Department of Defense,","start":3007.559,"duration":4.23},{"text":"there's a little bit of funding here from\nthe National Science Foundation, and then","start":3011.789,"duration":3.481},{"text":"there's everything that industry is doing.","start":3015.27,"duration":3.18},{"text":"What I'd like to see is a world in which an\nacademic or postdoc or something like that","start":3018.45,"duration":6.289},{"text":"doesn't see a big tradeoff between work in\nthe industry versus academia in terms of the","start":3024.739,"duration":5.75},{"text":"resources that they'll have and the amount\nof freedom that they'll have, because I think","start":3030.489,"duration":4.22},{"text":"we'll see both faster progress in AI and more\ncreativity, if people are able to think long","start":3034.709,"duration":4.49},{"text":"term in different sectors and not be constantly\nfighting over money.","start":3039.199,"duration":5.451},{"text":"But also there are areas that by necessity\nneed to be worked on over the long term.","start":3044.65,"duration":6.189},{"text":"So things like, for example, you would want\nthat to be always an option for ambitious","start":3050.839,"duration":5.5},{"text":"grad students to work on that but it's actually\nnot really the case today.","start":3056.339,"duration":2.42},{"text":"A lot of the time today, one could go to grad\nschool and not find an easy way to work on","start":3058.759,"duration":5.411},{"text":"AI safety because a lot of the grants available\nare permanent defense on X, Y and Z or something","start":3064.17,"duration":5.809},{"text":"like that.","start":3069.979,"duration":1.0},{"text":"They do fund some safety stuff but I would\nlike to see more balancing between the civilian","start":3070.979,"duration":5.14},{"text":"defense side and also more robust long term\nfunding for academia.","start":3076.119,"duration":10.43},{"text":"That makes sense.","start":3086.549,"duration":1.721},{"text":"What about regulation?","start":3088.27,"duration":1.75},{"text":"Besides more funding, would you want our government\nto enact some laws now, putting guardrails","start":3090.02,"duration":10.079},{"text":"around AI research or deployments?","start":3100.099,"duration":3.75},{"text":"Or would you want them to wait and see until\nthere's more information?","start":3103.849,"duration":4.171},{"text":"Yeah.","start":3108.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It's a good question, I think my answer is\nyes, they should do some stuff now and in","start":3109.02,"duration":5.42},{"text":"other areas, they should wait and see.","start":3114.44,"duration":1.559},{"text":"So I think in areas like driverless cars,\nfor example, there's already a clear reason","start":3115.999,"duration":5.77},{"text":"to act quickly and develop sectors like regulations.","start":3121.769,"duration":3.85},{"text":"I think another area where I'd like to see\nmore progress in developing clear guidance","start":3125.619,"duration":4.92},{"text":"for entrepreneurs and others is health applications\nin AI.","start":3130.539,"duration":5.17},{"text":"So where there is some effort to figure out\nhow AI systems should flow through the FDA,","start":3135.709,"duration":6.691},{"text":"for example, and what should that review process\nlook like?","start":3142.4,"duration":3.07},{"text":"I think that's an area where it would be beneficial\nto see more investment in capacity and expertise","start":3145.47,"duration":7.369},{"text":"in the government so that they have a better\nability to process these applications.","start":3152.839,"duration":5.53},{"text":"And also, clearer structures for getting AI\nsystems through strict regulatory process","start":3158.369,"duration":5.86},{"text":"- that I think could be very valuable.","start":3164.229,"duration":2.59},{"text":"I don't know exactly what the details of that\nshould look like but, you know, generally","start":3166.819,"duration":4.28},{"text":"that's something where we do not want people\nputting out health applications that are causing","start":3171.099,"duration":6.101},{"text":"harm.","start":3177.2,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But we also don't want zero health applications\nfrom AI.","start":3178.2,"duration":3.299},{"text":"So I think that's an area where some guardrails\nare to give people long term clarity so it's","start":3181.499,"duration":5.5},{"text":"not just a black box of, \"Oh, will, my system\nbe able to be deployed in like a year or two?\",","start":3186.999,"duration":4.76},{"text":"but then have long term signals I think would\nbe very valuable.","start":3191.759,"duration":4.641},{"text":"Yeah, that makes sense.","start":3196.4,"duration":2.24},{"text":"Cool.","start":3198.64,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Well, we always end with two questions.","start":3199.64,"duration":1.29},{"text":"I'm curious as to what you'll say about these.","start":3200.93,"duration":2.589},{"text":"The first one is kind of broad, but off the\ntop of your head when you think about all","start":3203.519,"duration":6.861},{"text":"these topics in machine learning, what's the\none that you think people don't talk about","start":3210.38,"duration":5.089},{"text":"enough?","start":3215.469,"duration":1.0},{"text":"What's the underrated topic that you'd like\nto push people to go maybe learn a little","start":3216.469,"duration":4.471},{"text":"more about?","start":3220.94,"duration":1.099},{"text":"I think one super interesting thing is detection\nof language model outputs.","start":3222.039,"duration":7.151},{"text":"And I mean, this is personally me being biased\nfrom working on GPT-2 a lot but there's actually","start":3229.19,"duration":5.629},{"text":"a ton of super interesting research.","start":3234.819,"duration":2.26},{"text":"Some things like how the sampling strategy\nrelates to scale-ability and how model size","start":3237.079,"duration":5.402},{"text":"relates to detectability and one area that's\nhow fine tuning relates to all that.","start":3242.481,"duration":6.009},{"text":"So you can imagine a world in which GPT-2\nor other systems are used to generate homework.","start":3248.49,"duration":4.9},{"text":"And this was...","start":3253.39,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Someone was just giving me an example of this\non twitter earlier today that I find funny.","start":3254.39,"duration":5.119},{"text":"So it's like people are using it to cheat\nor to generate phishing emails or something","start":3259.509,"duration":3.86},{"text":"like that.","start":3263.369,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I think it's a really interesting question,\nlike what the limiting case of lie detection","start":3264.369,"duration":4.98},{"text":"of language models is.","start":3269.349,"duration":1.26},{"text":"Like will it just always be...?","start":3270.609,"duration":1.43},{"text":"So

companies in the retail\nspace are not allowed to use AWS because they","start":426.66,"duration":5.71},{"text":"see them as a competitor and partially because\nthey are stepping up their game in the

going to have to start\nlooking into it.","start":453.12,"duration":3.85},{"text":"Interesting.","start":456.97,"duration":1.55},{"text":"Is there any tool that you think is underrated\nthat people probably should be using or you","start":458.52,"duration":4.83},{"text":"recommend, that people aren't using yet?","start":463.35,"duration":4.25},{"text":"I want to say, Bash.","start":467.6,"duration":7.95},{"text":"That's a really glib answer.","start":475.55,"duration":1.79},{"text":"But it's really true because a lot of the\ntimes when you come into these big, huge projects,","start":477.34,"duration":6.1},{"text":"you have five or six different AWS services\nspun off.","start":483.44,"duration":4.05},{"text":"You have GPUs, you have monitoring, you have\nall this stuff.","start":487.49,"duration":2.73},{"text":"And then you start thinking, \"Okay, well,\nI have all this stuff, How am I going to use","start":490.22,"duration":3.41},{"text":"it for us?","start":493.63,"duration":1.11},{"text":"While, oh, I can't test this locally, I can't\ndo this locally, I can't sample the data,","start":494.74,"duration":6.08},{"text":"what am I going to do with it?\"","start":500.82,"duration":1.43},{"text":"So I really do think, and I find myself falling\ninto this pattern too, where you use all this","start":502.25,"duration":5.55},{"text":"big data stuff, but then you don't use the\nstuff that you have available to you.","start":507.8,"duration":4.31},{"text":"And it's even easier these days when a lot\nof us are working with pretty high-powered","start":512.11,"duration":4.799},{"text":"machines that you can do a lot locally as\nwell.","start":516.909,"duration":4.32},{"text":"Interesting.","start":521.229,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So you run a lot of stuff locally?","start":522.229,"duration":1.981},{"text":"Some, yeah.","start":524.21,"duration":2.09},{"text":"Especially to test stuff to prototype and\nin cloud environments, it's really hard to","start":526.3,"duration":4.94},{"text":"spin up those local environments.","start":531.24,"duration":2.54},{"text":"So just even to look at the data, to examine\nwhat you're dealing with, all of that stuff,","start":533.78,"duration":5.87},{"text":"so you can do locally and you can bash.","start":539.65,"duration":2.91},{"text":"Bash goes a long way towards that.","start":542.56,"duration":1.3},{"text":"So I know that you can't talk about your individual\ncustomers, but can you talk broadly about","start":543.86,"duration":6.17},{"text":"the questions that are driving more interest\nin data science right now?","start":550.03,"duration":6.59},{"text":"Like, what's top of mind?","start":556.62,"duration":1.46},{"text":"What do you expect going into another Fortune\n500 company that the executives want out of","start":558.08,"duration":6.27},{"text":"their data science platform they're not getting\nright now?","start":564.35,"duration":4.42},{"text":"The number one question is always to understand\ncustomers, understand what they're doing,","start":568.77,"duration":6.43},{"text":"and understand how what the customers are\ndoing ties directly to the bottom line.","start":575.2,"duration":4.66},{"text":"And that manifests itself in a number of different\nways.","start":579.86,"duration":3.1},{"text":"The one that I usually talk about, which I've\nalso written a blog post about, is churn.","start":582.96,"duration":4.8},{"text":"Everybody always wants to know churn.","start":587.76,"duration":2.32},{"text":"So how many people are leaving, why are they\nleaving your platform and how much money is","start":590.08,"duration":5.69},{"text":"it going to cost you on a month-to-month basis?","start":595.77,"duration":2.7},{"text":"Everybody always wants to know that, and I\ncan guarantee in any given project they'll","start":598.47,"duration":3.76},{"text":"see it.","start":602.23,"duration":1.7},{"text":"And then the second one is better understanding\noperational metrics.","start":603.93,"duration":5.94},{"text":"There's sometimes not a lot of insight into\nthat.","start":609.87,"duration":3.42},{"text":"And the third one would probably be classifying\ncustomers into different types of customers.","start":613.29,"duration":6.59},{"text":"Interesting, what's a deliverable you would\ngive a company around trends that they'd be","start":619.88,"duration":6.19},{"text":"excited about?","start":626.07,"duration":1.4},{"text":"Can you literally say I can predict churn\nX percent better or is it if you see the signal","start":627.47,"duration":5.02},{"text":"then that means turn?","start":632.49,"duration":1.17},{"text":"How do you actually present analysis?","start":633.66,"duration":2.22},{"text":"Yes, a lever.","start":635.88,"duration":2.25},{"text":"It would be literally a platform that has\ninformation to be able to predict what churn","start":638.13,"duration":9.22},{"text":"is going to be, for example, for next month.","start":647.35,"duration":3.73},{"text":"Usually what ends up happening is a lot of\nthe things that I'll deliver are the data","start":651.08,"duration":4.88},{"text":"engineering piece around getting all the data\nall together in one place so we can have a","start":655.96,"duration":4.47},{"text":"data lake so we can actually deliver that\nChurn piece.","start":660.43,"duration":5.13},{"text":"And how sophisticated would a Churn prediction\nmodel be today?","start":665.56,"duration":97.37},{"text":"Are people using deep learning for this or\nwhat's how complicated these models get?","start":762.93,"duration":12.23},{"text":"I don't think they're.","start":775.16,"duration":1.82},{"text":"I think a lot of times, companies, and even\nbefore I was doing consulting in all my previous","start":776.98,"duration":5.84},{"text":"jobs, people are just impressed if you can\nget a model out the door.","start":782.82,"duration":4.98},{"text":"Also lot of the times in the industry overall.","start":787.8,"duration":4.62},{"text":"So, if you have something that you can benchmark\nagainst, it's seen as good, especially because","start":792.42,"duration":5.72},{"text":"there's so many steps in doing it.","start":798.14,"duration":2.49},{"text":"So first you have to collect the data, then\nyou have to clean the data.","start":800.63,"duration":3.46},{"text":"Then you have to go to the customer support\nteam and say, 'does someone calling in mean","start":804.09,"duration":6.07},{"text":"that the person might churn or not?'","start":810.16,"duration":2.38},{"text":"And then you have to collect all the manual\ndata that they keep and keep track of that.","start":812.54,"duration":4.26},{"text":"Then you have to build the model, then you\nhave to do a prediction, then you have to","start":816.8,"duration":3.95},{"text":"meet with the people who are in charge of\nthis and explain your data to them.","start":820.75,"duration":4.57},{"text":"And then there's going to be a back and forth\nthere.","start":825.32,"duration":1.99},{"text":"And then you have to productionalize all of\nthat.","start":827.31,"duration":3.24},{"text":"So if you can get a model end-to-end going,\nand I've come into companies where there was","start":830.55,"duration":4.41},{"text":"zero data science before...","start":834.96,"duration":1.39},{"text":"And that's why I'm saying that you have to\nbuild it from the ground up.","start":836.35,"duration":3.56},{"text":"Having that is fantastic.","start":839.91,"duration":2.3},{"text":"And just having metrics where there were no\nmetrics before is a huge step up.","start":842.21,"duration":4.04},{"text":"And then the next step up is, of course, 'Okay,\nwell, why is this metric different this month?","start":846.25,"duration":4.39},{"text":"Why is this metric different that month?'","start":850.64,"duration":1.44},{"text":"So, a lot of the churn models I've built have\nbeen with pretty basic stuff like logistic","start":852.08,"duration":6.32},{"text":"regression and decision trees.","start":858.4,"duration":2.96},{"text":"I haven't seen any deep learning used for\nchurn yet, but I'm sure that use is just around","start":861.36,"duration":4.55},{"text":"the corner.","start":865.91,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Okay, here's a specific question.","start":866.91,"duration":1.98},{"text":"I mean, decision trees versus logistic regression\nthey do different things.","start":868.89,"duration":3.86},{"text":"Do you have a particular one you start with\nor do you try both or some kind of hybrid?","start":872.75,"duration":7.029},{"text":"So again, it depends on the data available.","start":879.779,"duration":3.291},{"text":"Usually, it also depends on who's going to\nbe looking at it.","start":883.07,"duration":5.35},{"text":"Usually if it's people at a higher level,\nlike executives that need to briefly glance","start":888.42,"duration":5.0},{"text":"and understand something immediately, the\ndecision tree is very intuitive and very easy","start":893.42,"duration":4.859},{"text":"to explain and it can offer a number of different\npathways for discussion.","start":898.279,"duration":6.821},{"text":"If you just need some sort of model that spits\nout, 'Is this person going to Churn yes or","start":905.1,"duration":5.41},{"text":"no?', Logistic regression is a little bit\nbetter for that.","start":910.51,"duration":4.079},{"text":"But again, it depends on the stack that they\nhave.","start":914.589,"duration":4.341},{"text":"There's different software packages that are\nbetter or worse for logistic regression.","start":918.93,"duration":4.13},{"text":"So, for example, surprisingly, Python, as\nfar as I know, does not have a very good decision","start":923.06,"duration":6.11},{"text":"tree support.","start":929.17,"duration":1.19},{"text":"You could do XGBoost, which is not quite the\nsame, but aren't exact","start":930.36,"duration":5.54},{"text":"It's like multiples decision trees, right?","start":935.9,"duration":1.81},{"text":"Nested decision trees.","start":937.71,"duration":1.57},{"text":"Just got boosted trees, but it doesn't offer\nthe nice visual interpretation, I guess, as","start":939.28,"duration":7.98},{"text":"much as the R package.","start":947.26,"duration":1.66},{"text":"So, yeah, it really depends on what you have\navailable, what you can do, all that kind","start":948.92,"duration":6.96},{"text":"of stuff.","start":955.88,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But I would say all or any three of those\nare my go-to tools for that.","start":956.88,"duration":3.31},{"text":"Interesting.","start":960.19,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So you'll build a stable pipeline that includes\nR in it?","start":961.19,"duration":4.55},{"text":"I've done it for stuff where I've had to prototype\nand throw it out.","start":965.74,"duration":5.8},{"text":"I actually have not built on our pipeline\nin production, although I know it's very possible","start":971.54,"duration":5.01},{"text":"and increasingly becoming more and more possible.","start":976.55,"duration":5.35},{"text":"Interesting.","start":981.9,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So do feel like, R, is here to stay or do\nyou feel like it's getting replaced by python,","start":982.9,"duration":4.93},{"text":"what do you think?.","start":987.83,"duration":1.63},{"text":"I think they're two different tools for two\ndifferent things.","start":989.46,"duration":3.87},{"text":"So I think R is fantastic for statistics,\nfor stuff that you're working on in probably","start":993.33,"duration":6.68},{"text":"smaller teams and Python is more of a general\ntool, like if you need to glue stuff together","start":1000.01,"duration":7.41},{"text":"and if you need to do deep learning and if\nyou need to have stuff, you'll use Python.","start":1007.42,"duration":5.75},{"text":"But its basic statistical capabilities are\nnot as good as a lot of the R packages are.","start":1013.17,"duration":6.81},{"text":"How do you think about leaving your work in\na state where another person can update it?","start":1019.98,"duration":8.39},{"text":"How does it happen?","start":1028.37,"duration":2.37},{"text":"Do you ever check back in with a client and\nsee if anyone's touched your model and still","start":1030.74,"duration":4.5},{"text":"useful for them?","start":1035.24,"duration":1.16},{"text":"That seems like it must be really hard.","start":1036.4,"duration":3.529},{"text":"What we usually do is we work side by side\nwith the client.","start":1039.929,"duration":4.231},{"text":"So we'll have a person on the client side\nwho is a data scientist so we can hand it","start":1044.16,"duration":4.39},{"text":"off or we'll have teams, and so we do education\nthroughout the process so we can hand it off,","start":1048.55,"duration":5.58},{"text":"and I just be like this person knows how to\npick it up and knows how it was being built.","start":1054.13,"duration":5.78},{"text":"I see.","start":1059.91,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That makes sense and you probably pick the\ntechnologies they're familiar with or...","start":1060.91,"duration":5.58},{"text":"For sure.","start":1066.49,"duration":1.31},{"text":"So we try to pick technologies that are not\nforeign to the client.","start":1067.8,"duration":4.02},{"text":"So it's not like they're completely floundering\nand gone when we hand over PyTorch or something.","start":1071.82,"duration":5.28},{"text":"So what's the biggest frustration in this\nwhole process?","start":1077.1,"duration":7.01},{"text":"Where do you see the biggest room for potential\nimprovement?","start":1084.11,"duration":3.199},{"text":"I mean, we've both sold into big companies\nand it's challenging.","start":1087.309,"duration":3.721},{"text":"Like you do want to say bad things about your\nclients, but also do you have any patterns","start":1091.03,"duration":11.99},{"text":"there?","start":1103.02,"duration":4.68},{"text":"I think the biggest issue is trying to explain\nthe benefit of machine learning in a way where","start":1107.7,"duration":7.15},{"text":"it's not always exactly clear.","start":1114.85,"duration":2.78},{"text":"So for example, you'll come to someone and\nthey say, 'OK, well, I want to figure out","start":1117.63,"duration":4.45},{"text":"customer churn.'","start":1122.08,"duration":1.09},{"text":"And you're like, 'OK, we'll build this model\nbut I can't guarantee that it's going to be","start":1123.17,"duration":3.81},{"text":"good.","start":1126.98,"duration":1.34},{"text":"I can't guarantee it's going to be accurate\nin the first pass.'","start":1128.32,"duration":2.96},{"text":"But in the meantime, you have to figure out\nhow long you're gonna be at the client, how","start":1131.28,"duration":4.79},{"text":"much value you're going to add.","start":1136.07,"duration":1.77},{"text":"So it's very, very hazy.","start":1137.84,"duration":1.9},{"text":"And I think that's more of a frustration for\nme.","start":1139.74,"duration":3.55},{"text":"But it's also an educational issue where you're\nnot going to always get to a right answer,","start":1143.29,"duration":7.48},{"text":"like the first sprint or the second sprint.","start":1150.77,"duration":2.88},{"text":"It's going to be an iterative process and\nsometimes, if you add stuff, the model get","start":1153.65,"duration":4.14},{"text":"worse.","start":1157.79,"duration":1.0},{"text":"If you take stuff away, the models get better.","start":1158.79,"duration":1.75},{"text":"So it's kind of hard because data science\nis always sold or rather I see it being sold","start":1160.54,"duration":6.0},{"text":"as this exact thing, but it's very much like\nan art process.","start":1166.54,"duration":4.97},{"text":"And so I think that's where some of the frustration\nis.","start":1171.51,"duration":2.72},{"text":"It's not an exact thing and people expect\nit to be.","start":1174.23,"duration":2.78},{"text":"And I can imagine it's probably really hard\ngoing in, like apparently not knowing the","start":1177.01,"duration":4.45},{"text":"amount of lift.","start":1181.46,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Somebody is like, I for sure want this to\nget better.","start":1182.46,"duration":1.99},{"text":"So it's like, well without the data, how would\nyou know?","start":1184.45,"duration":4.19},{"text":"How do you articulate that?","start":1188.64,"duration":1.62},{"text":"If someone's like, \"Hey, tell me how much\nyou know you're going to improve my churn","start":1190.26,"duration":6.14},{"text":"prediction\", what would you say to that?","start":1196.4,"duration":4.92},{"text":"First I don't know, I've actually never had\nit happen that someone was like you have to","start":1201.32,"duration":9.19},{"text":"improve my model by this much.","start":1210.51,"duration":2.14},{"text":"It's usually like let's create a model to\ndo X, Y or Z.","start":1212.65,"duration":5.87},{"text":"But what we usually do is benchmark against\nprevious metrics that they have.","start":1218.52,"duration":5.49},{"text":"And so the goal there is to say, 'look, we're\nnot sure how much we can improve your model,","start":1224.01,"duration":4.65},{"text":"but we can improve the process around the\nmodels so that it can be a little clearer.'","start":1228.66,"duration":4.44},{"text":"When you look at the successful engagements\nwhere you feel like you really made a difference","start":1233.1,"duration":7.22},{"text":"versus the ones that are more frustrating,\nare there patterns your more successful clients","start":1240.32,"duration":9.15},{"text":"are exhibiting around data science that sets\nthem up for success?","start":1249.47,"duration":4.57},{"text":"Usually working in a tight loop with me.","start":1254.04,"duration":3.019},{"text":"So a lot of the times the companies I work\nat will be bigger.","start":1257.059,"duration":3.911},{"text":"And so the data science team will be on one\nside.","start":1260.97,"duration":2.93},{"text":"The data engineering team will be on one side.","start":1263.9,"duration":2.19},{"text":"The project management team will be somewhere\nover there.","start":1266.09,"duration":2.969},{"text":"And so I'll talk to all of them.","start":1269.059,"duration":2.561},{"text":"But they don't talk to each other necessarily.","start":1271.62,"duration":4.52},{"text":"And so what I've seen work best is when I'm\nembedded with a developer, a data scientist,","start":1276.14,"duration":5.53},{"text":"a project manager, that are all kind of working\ntogether towards the same thing because there's","start":1281.67,"duration":5.73},{"text":"a big tendency to get silo-ed.","start":1287.4,"duration":2.399},{"text":"So I think companies debate internally about\n\"Should we have a single data science function","start":1289.799,"duration":7.301},{"text":"or should we embed the data scientists and\nhave the different kind of functional teams,","start":1297.1,"duration":4.579},{"text":"hire data scientists for the individual products\nthat they're working on?\"","start":1301.679,"duration":4.201},{"text":"Do you have an opinion? it sounds like you\nmight prefer data science being embedded in","start":1305.88,"duration":4.16},{"text":"specific products that are specific outcomes,\nor do you think that it's better to keep it","start":1310.04,"duration":5.09},{"text":"all as a single function so you can hire better\npeople or create a better culture?","start":1315.13,"duration":5.22},{"text":"I'm not really sure I have an opinion on that.","start":1320.35,"duration":2.72},{"text":"I've seen it work well, different ways in\ndifferent companies.","start":1323.07,"duration":4.6},{"text":"I think probably for smaller companies, I\nwould say less than a thousand people or so,","start":1327.67,"duration":5.389},{"text":"you probably want to have a centralized team\nand for much, much larger companies, you probably","start":1333.059,"duration":6.671},{"text":"want to have embedded data science teams.","start":1339.73,"duration":2.329},{"text":"But then the danger is, if you don't manage\nthem centrally, then you have five or six","start":1342.059,"duration":4.351},{"text":"data science teams working on the same questions.","start":1346.41,"duration":2.81},{"text":"And I've definitely seen this at companies\nwhere it's just replicated work and they're","start":1349.22,"duration":4.17},{"text":"just approaching it in different ways.","start":1353.39,"duration":3.56},{"text":"So you really have seen success in both.","start":1356.95,"duration":3.96},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1360.91,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah, for sure.","start":1361.91,"duration":3.41},{"text":"I see.","start":1365.32,"duration":5.12},{"text":"Do you see specific stages where you're prototyping\nsomething and then deploy it into production?","start":1370.44,"duration":5.8},{"text":"It sounds like you're really focused on getting\nthings stable and in production, but do you","start":1376.24,"duration":6.25},{"text":"prototype the steps first and then solidify\nthem?","start":1382.49,"duration":1.91},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1384.4,"duration":1.0},{"text":"You simply say to a client, \"we're gonna prototype\nand then we're gonna deploy it\"?","start":1385.4,"duration":5.64},{"text":"Yeah, that's usually what we do.","start":1391.04,"duration":2.32},{"text":"So usually I come into an environment and\nyou're not really clear on what's going on","start":1393.36,"duration":5.07},{"text":"in the environment at all.","start":1398.43,"duration":2.07},{"text":"You're just kind of thrown in and told, okay,\ngo.","start":1400.5,"duration":3.48},{"text":"So the first step is to gather and assess\nwhat's going on.","start":1403.98,"duration":4.64},{"text":"What tools are they using?","start":1408.62,"duration":1.12},{"text":"Who are the key people involved in this?","start":1409.74,"duration":3.61},{"text":"Gather all of that and start to create a model\nfrom whatever data

more\nbecause software is, you have a piece of code,","start":1890.94,"duration":5.75},{"text":"you put it in Docker, you put it somewhere\nand it goes.","start":1896.69,"duration":2.81},{"text":"This is, you have to keep track of data that's\nflowing in from COFCO or Kinesis or streaming.","start":1899.5,"duration":6.12},{"text":"You have to make sure that all of that

day.","start":1921.45,"duration":1.41},{"text":"So you have to plan for that.","start":1922.86,"duration":1.78},{"text":"And like I said, I think we're still in the\nearly stages of planning for that.","start":1924.64,"duration":4.43},{"text":"Then you have to expose your model to some\nservice or some end point that's going to","start":1929.07,"duration":4.87},{"text":"consume it.","start":1933.94,"duration":1.65},{"text":"The model piece itself, you have to put somewhere\nlike Docker or whatever.","start":1935.59,"duration":4.969},{"text":"You have to make sure to orchestrate all of\nthat.","start":1940.559,"duration":3.801},{"text":"So this is very similar to software, except,\nI think we like in modern software

means in theory, it's supposed to\nmake it easier for you.","start":1954.76,"duration":4.289},{"text":"But what it means is that the software developer\nalso now has to be a system admin and understand","start":1959.049,"duration":5.631},{"text":"some of those pieces in the cloud brought\nin the fact that you also now have to be a","start":1964.68,"duration":3.619},{"text":"network

that.","start":1977.14,"duration":1.05},{"text":"And you have to know the data and you have\nto know how the model that you're creating","start":1978.19,"duration":4.739},{"text":"works.","start":1982.929,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So putting that altogether in production is\nreally hard.","start":1983.929,"duration":3.931},{"text":"And so I would say that's the biggest thing.","start":1987.86,"duration":2.67},{"text":"Well said.","start":1990.53,"duration":1.08},{"text":"I have

the","start":324.4,"duration":4.689},{"text":"specific examples versus.","start":329.089,"duration":1.771},{"text":"He actually was a physicist, and he's like,\nI hate having other physicists because they","start":330.86,"duration":3.66},{"text":"always try to look in generalities instead\nof being specific.","start":334.52,"duration":3.179},{"text":"And he felt like what the team really

talking about that.","start":350.599,"duration":2.65},{"text":"Yeah.","start":353.249,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And it's huge in our domain because we have\nthese robots deployed literally in every

of machine learning.","start":408.649,"duration":1.11},{"text":"I mean, I think it's always obviously relevant\nbut it wasn't machine learning first

start building an ML skill set\nat iRobot?","start":428.779,"duration":5.66},{"text":"I think it's an interesting thing about iRobot\nhistory when they first started over 30 years","start":434.439,"duration":4.47},{"text":"ago now.","start":438.909,"duration":3.28},{"text":"Almost every single part of the solution had\nto be made by iRobot thinking about,

improve our products using those\nskill sets and expertise\".","start":472.319,"duration":4.171},{"text":"So I think machine learning has been at iRobot\nfor quite a while now, mainly started in

improving our hardware","start":502.909,"duration":6.19},{"text":"solutions for things like navigation and cleaning\nexperiences.","start":509.099,"duration":3.13},{"text":"So it's been interesting to see the journey.","start":512.229,"duration":2.74},{"text":"And I think machine learning is starting to\nbe a bigger piece of the iRobot solutions","start":514.969,"duration":4.181},{"text":"moving forward.","start":519.15,"duration":1.72},{"text":"When do you think it first became a production\nthing?","start":520.87,"duration":5.92},{"text":"And what was the impetus like?","start":526.79,"duration":1.79},{"text":"What what was the application that drove it?","start":528.58,"duration":2.87},{"text":"Initially, I think the first application that\nwe could really call ML, if not ML adjacent,","start":531.45,"duration":8.35},{"text":"really ML, is Slam.","start":539.8,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Which is the localization and the mapping\nof how the robot

lot of the tooling had to be\ninvented and by iRobot too.","start":556.17,"duration":4.77},{"text":"And so I think the legacy of ML applications\nin production at iRobot, if you include the","start":560.94,"duration":5.67},{"text":"same component, is actually a quite longstanding\none but in terms of the more typically defined","start":566.61,"duration":9.28},{"text":"ML, I think it

connected.","start":584.28,"duration":3.54},{"text":"So for a very long time, these robots were\ncompletely self-sufficient, closed systems.","start":587.82,"duration":5.65},{"text":"They came out of the manufacturing line, onto\nan inventory somewhere, into a customer's","start":593.47,"duration":4.91},{"text":"home, and then it just worked and there was\nno way to either collect any information off","start":598.38,"duration":5.58},{"text":"it or to send information to it to modify\nits behavior.","start":603.96,"duration":4.97},{"text":"In late 2015, when we started having the IOT\nconnection component to the stack, that really","start":608.93,"duration":5.66},{"text":"opened the door to improved data collection,\nwhich is really the thing without which you","start":614.59,"duration":5.17},{"text":"can't have meaningful ML that actually does\nsomething that feels auto magical to the customer","start":619.76,"duration":9.52},{"text":"experience.","start":629.28,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I think that's, from a historic perspective,\nwhere iRobot started using ML in the production","start":630.28,"duration":6.82},{"text":"environment and I also think that one thing\nthat shapes the iRobot story quite deeply","start":637.1,"duration":5.83},{"text":"is exactly what Danielle was saying; is that\nbecause a lot of the initial tooling was built","start":642.93,"duration":4.85},{"text":"in-house, we have had a really interesting\nblend of standard tool choices versus the","start":647.78,"duration":10.15},{"text":"deep customization that's really part of the\nDNA of the company.","start":657.93,"duration":5.24},{"text":"So that's one of the things that has been\nreally interesting over the last two years,","start":663.17,"duration":5.98},{"text":"especially once this really proved itself\ninternally.","start":669.15,"duration":3.77},{"text":"And we've been able to demonstrate just how\nvaluable this is, both for our internal use","start":672.92,"duration":5.65},{"text":"just to improve our own software development\ncapability, but also to help

the business.","start":692.51,"duration":2.75},{"text":"That's so interesting.","start":695.26,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So it was really Internet connectivity that\nmade ML applications possible.","start":696.26,"duration":4.89},{"text":"I'm not sure if it's \"possible\", but it's\nwhat finally made the case that even if it","start":701.15,"duration":7.0},{"text":"had been possible before, it might have been\nprohibitive to collect enough training and","start":708.15,"duration":4.52},{"text":"validation data for these things to be robust\nin a way that will work on an apartment in","start":712.67,"duration":6.82},{"text":"Singapore, the same way that it will work\non a ranch in Texas, right?","start":719.49,"duration":3.96},{"text":"So the ability to really collect a complete\npicture of what it is that these machine learning","start":723.45,"duration":8.98},{"text":"algorithms are going to be interacting with,\nit really didn't make sense because we wouldn't","start":732.43,"duration":4.06},{"text":"have been able to meet the magical delightful\nexpectation that our global customers might","start":736.49,"duration":5.91},{"text":"have had.","start":742.4,"duration":1.94},{"text":"Cool.","start":744.34,"duration":1.36},{"text":"So tell me about your team, what are the different\npeople doing?","start":745.7,"duration":3.81},{"text":"What are the relative sizes of investment\nand different modeling, deployment.?","start":749.51,"duration":6.48},{"text":"Are you mostly researchers?","start":755.99,"duration":2.25},{"text":"Are you mostly engineers?.","start":758.24,"duration":1.44},{"text":"How do you think about that?","start":759.68,"duration":1.0},{"text":"What are the different functions and how do\nthey all work together?","start":760.68,"duration":5.45},{"text":"The team has changed a lot over the years\nas we've shifted from more of the research","start":766.13,"duration":4.12},{"text":"side of proven concepts of machine learning\napplication that we can do, to thinking about","start":770.25,"duration":4.09},{"text":"production applications.","start":774.34,"duration":1.62},{"text":"So we have a team that's dedicated to thinking\nabout machine learning algorithms and models,","start":775.96,"duration":4.57},{"text":"thinking about how we develop those models?","start":780.53,"duration":3.27},{"text":"What is the appropriate type of data to feed\ninto those models and how do we improve them","start":783.8,"duration":3.46},{"text":"over time?","start":787.26,"duration":1.25},{"text":"So that team would essentially be machine\nlearning practitioners.","start":788.51,"duration":7.36},{"text":"I mean, how would it?","start":795.87,"duration":1.53},{"text":"Apparently they're using ML mostly?","start":797.4,"duration":1.75},{"text":"This is the only part of the team that will\nbe stereotypical ML.","start":799.15,"duration":4.13},{"text":"So I'll talk a little bit more now of the\nother parts of the team.","start":803.28,"duration":3.94},{"text":"When you talk about a machine learning team,\neverybody thinks, OK, that's people doing","start":807.22,"duration":3.13},{"text":"algorithms, right?","start":810.35,"duration":2.14},{"text":"We do have some of those people.","start":812.49,"duration":1.18},{"text":"But its like..","start":813.67,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Can you say a little bit about the relative\nsize of these teams.","start":814.67,"duration":2.63},{"text":"I think it's just really interesting that\nyou're in production and doing the stuff.","start":817.3,"duration":3.77},{"text":"Yeah.","start":821.07,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So the modeling team out of the machine learning\nteam all up is actually of a small size, I","start":822.07,"duration":5.79},{"text":"think that they're about a quarter of the\nsize of the full team.","start":827.86,"duration":4.37},{"text":"So the modeling team, they're doing the algorithm\ndevelopment and then there's complementary","start":832.23,"duration":4.94},{"text":"teams that work beside them.","start":837.17,"duration":1.98},{"text":"Another team that's working is on more of\nthe integration side.","start":839.15,"duration":3.64},{"text":"So how do they take the algorithms and actually\ndeploy them to the robots?","start":842.79,"duration":3.45},{"text":"They are thinking through what is the supporting\ninfrastructure with the bottle conversion","start":846.24,"duration":4.12},{"text":"process to run on this limited hardware.","start":850.36,"duration":2.7},{"text":"Obviously, we need to not use the same types\nof models that you can do with big GPU machines","start":853.06,"duration":5.3},{"text":"so thinking about the integration of these\nalgorithms onto the robot,","start":858.36,"duration":3.49},{"text":"What do you call that team?","start":861.85,"duration":2.54},{"text":"Is that like ML ops?","start":864.39,"duration":2.09},{"text":"We actually call it an integration team.","start":866.48,"duration":3.43},{"text":"Integrating into the robot software and the\nsurrounding infrastructure around it.","start":869.91,"duration":3.5},{"text":"Are these people kind of hardware-ish people?","start":873.41,"duration":4.95},{"text":"They're still mostly software but have an\nunderstanding of the hardware too and they","start":878.36,"duration":4.31},{"text":"can work with folks in hardware on specific\napplications.","start":882.67,"duration":5.25},{"text":"And one interesting part about doing machine\nlearning applications on robots is it's not","start":887.92,"duration":4.67},{"text":"just the ML algorithm, but it's how it interacts\nin the system as a whole.","start":892.59,"duration":4.67},{"text":"So these are the folks that really need to\nthink through the end-to-end solution of how","start":897.26,"duration":4.23},{"text":"and what the metrics of the system are?","start":901.49,"duration":2.3},{"text":"How does it affect performance of the robot\nat the end of the day, things like we want","start":903.79,"duration":4.43},{"text":"cleaning coverage, we want robots to clean\nall parts of their house, we want to maximize","start":908.22,"duration":5.809},{"text":"these metrics from the customer's point of\nview, not the algorithm point of view.","start":914.029,"duration":3.151},{"text":"So are some of these people more business\nfocused?","start":917.18,"duration":3.36},{"text":"They're not but they're thinking about how\nto capture the metrics to report to the business","start":920.54,"duration":3.4},{"text":"folks and thinking about what those metrics\nare.","start":923.94,"duration":3.27},{"text":"So thinking about the system level metrics\nrather than just the individual algorithm","start":927.21,"duration":3.96},{"text":"metrics.","start":931.17,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And just to complement that, it's really iterative.","start":932.17,"duration":3.62},{"text":"So we have an R&D organization and then a\nproduct organization and they're sister organizations.","start":935.79,"duration":7.39},{"text":"So Danielle and I are on the R&D side of the\nequation and there are the teams that she's","start":943.18,"duration":6.95},{"text":"going to continue to talk about.","start":950.13,"duration":1.709},{"text":"There's the four teams within the machine\nlearning proper, and then each one of those","start":951.839,"duration":4.061},{"text":"has a counterpart within R&D that's attached\nto a program.","start":955.9,"duration":4.72},{"text":"So if it's a specific robot or a specific\nfeature or a specific customer deliverable,","start":960.62,"duration":5.68},{"text":"there's somebody that's integrating that machine\nlearning component with all of the other R&D","start":966.3,"duration":3.77},{"text":"components that are necessary to deliver the\ncomplete final box solution, either as an","start":970.07,"duration":7.33},{"text":"over the air update, an OTA or to the manufacturing\nframe work.","start":977.4,"duration":4.53},{"text":"On the third leg to that stool is the product\nteam.","start":981.93,"duration":4.68},{"text":"So we have business counterparts who own that\nproduct feature deliverable from the business","start":986.61,"duration":7.61},{"text":"standpoint.","start":994.22,"duration":1.559},{"text":"They may not know what's technically feasible\nor they're actually incredibly robust at iRobot","start":995.779,"duration":6.5},{"text":"because we do have a bias for technologists\nso that tends to not truly be the case but","start":1002.279,"duration":4.941},{"text":"they have these R&D partners who can help\nthem iterate on how do we define these metrics.","start":1007.22,"duration":6.65},{"text":"Do we care only about end states and lack\nof interstitial errors or do we care about","start":1013.87,"duration":4.69},{"text":"that within the context of cleaning coverage\nand cleaning efficiency and all of the other","start":1018.56,"duration":4.92},{"text":"low abandonment rates, all of the holistic\nexperience of what this thing is supposed","start":1023.48,"duration":5.04},{"text":"to deliver?","start":1028.52,"duration":1.01},{"text":"And so that spans the gamut but for instance,\non the first team that Danielle was talking","start":1029.53,"duration":6.299},{"text":"about, the modeling team, the way that they\ntalk to their business counterpart is almost","start":1035.829,"duration":6.141},{"text":"similar to the way that they talk to the integration\nteam.","start":1041.97,"duration":2.689},{"text":"So they can write models and write papers\nand then tell the integration team that \"this","start":1044.659,"duration":4.12},{"text":"is the aha, this is the thing, the solution\"\nbut they are not as constrained with, \"What's","start":1048.779,"duration":7.39},{"text":"the compute accounting?","start":1056.169,"duration":1.1},{"text":"How much budget do we have to be able to run\nthis as the robot is doing all of these other","start":1057.269,"duration":4.26},{"text":"things that it actually has to do as well?\"","start":1061.529,"duration":2.811},{"text":"And so it truly is a really well integrated\nand iterative process.","start":1064.34,"duration":5.6},{"text":"It's not that they go into their nerd cave,\nthey come up with a solution and they come","start":1069.94,"duration":3.599},{"text":"out and toss it over the fence.","start":1073.539,"duration":2.64},{"text":"Yeah, definitely.","start":1076.179,"duration":3.391},{"text":"So after the integration team, there's a team\nthat's focused on actually what you mentioned","start":1079.57,"duration":4.62},{"text":"before.","start":1084.19,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Look at the platform and operations teams\nthat's separate from the integration team","start":1085.19,"duration":3.589},{"text":"and this is the team that is helping with\nthe infrastructure that supports both modeling","start":1088.779,"duration":4.38},{"text":"and integration work.","start":1093.159,"duration":1.52},{"text":"So things like, how do we scale out our compute?","start":1094.679,"duration":3.401},{"text":"How do we train our models and store models\nand things like that?","start":1098.08,"duration":3.169},{"text":"So how do you think about the different skillset\nbetween that team and the integrations team?","start":1101.249,"duration":8.591},{"text":"So the integration team is a lot in our case\nbecause we're deploying on a robot, therefore","start":1109.84,"duration":5.909},{"text":"they also have often C++ knowledge to be able\nto integrate the models into that environment.","start":1115.749,"duration":5.54},{"text":"They have built system experience around the\nrobot software.","start":1121.289,"duration":4.441},{"text":"So the integration team is more focused on\nhow do we make this stuff real on the robot","start":1125.73,"duration":4.919},{"text":"versus the platform team is how do we build\nsupporting infrastructure to support both","start":1130.649,"duration":5.331},{"text":"of those other teams?","start":1135.98,"duration":1.829},{"text":"And the platform team is, generally speaking,\nmore cloud focused.","start":1137.809,"duration":4.7},{"text":"We use AWS at iRobot for a majority of our\napplications and so how do we build serverless","start":1142.509,"duration":5.53},{"text":"applications on the cloud to support those\ndifferent applications.","start":1148.039,"duration":6.701},{"text":"We found that having an integration team separate\nfrom the model and separate from the architecture","start":1154.74,"duration":5.679},{"text":"and separate from advanced solutions is really\nimportant.","start":1160.419,"duration":5.1},{"text":"Because of this, the last mile of deploying\nmachine learning to production is really long.","start":1165.519,"duration":7.16},{"text":"And we have all of the added complexity that\nour last mile is incredibly restricted, automated","start":1172.679,"duration":7.531},{"text":"robotic sensor, autonomous platform that's\ndeployed in environments we can't control","start":1180.21,"duration":6.069},{"text":"and we can't really modify.","start":1186.279,"duration":2.5},{"text":"So having a team dedicated to focusing on\njust how hard that last mile is has really","start":1188.779,"duration":7.28},{"text":"paid off in terms of, yes, if it's added complexity,\nhaving a whole another team added specialization","start":1196.059,"duration":6.151},{"text":"like we, that's not free, but it's definitely\nbeen a net positive.","start":1202.21,"duration":7.23},{"text":"And what's the last team?","start":1209.44,"duration":1.69},{"text":"So the last team is a reinforcement learning\nteam, they specialize in reinforcement learning","start":1211.13,"duration":5.119},{"text":"applications.","start":1216.249,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And they work closely with the integration\nteam and the platform team for the same applications","start":1217.249,"duration":4.31},{"text":"as the modeling team, just the modelling team\nis focused on other applications.","start":1221.559,"duration":6.18},{"text":"Like a

though.","start":1290.96,"duration":1.849},{"text":"Two things actually.","start":1292.809,"duration":1.11},{"text":"One, we are hiring.","start":1293.919,"duration":2.51},{"text":"So if you have experience in embedded systems\nand machine learning, toolchain, automation,","start":1296.429,"duration":6.511},{"text":"let me know, we're very much hiring.","start":1302.94,"duration":4.39},{"text":"But also, one thing that's amazing about iRobot\nis that it's actually not that hard to hire.","start":1307.33,"duration":6.709},{"text":"I mean, yes, it is, because this is a very\nspecialized skill set that we're looking for,","start":1314.039,"duration":6.27},{"text":"given that we've reached a level of scale\nwhere that specialization pays off for us.","start":1320.309,"duration":4.041},{"text":"But iRobot is really a cool place that's really\nwell connected.","start":1324.35,"duration":4.19},{"text":"We have a lot of really smart people working\nalongside us who have very broad networks.","start":1328.54,"duration":6.0},{"text":"So we actually get a lot of really smart,\nreally competent folks reaching out to us","start":1334.54,"duration":5.72},{"text":"a lot, which I'm very grateful for, because\nas you've noted, these tend to be really hard","start":1340.26,"duration":5.909},{"text":"skill sets to

curious.","start":1451.08,"duration":3.12},{"text":"Do you notice that there's any challenges\nwith cultural differences or miscommunications","start":1454.2,"duration":7.189},{"text":"between these teams?","start":1461.389,"duration":1.11},{"text":"I think you actually do hire fairly different\npeople, has there been any kind of lessons","start":1462.499,"duration":4.961},{"text":"learned from trying to get everyone to work\ntogether to build something?","start":1467.46,"duration":4.079},{"text":"I think one really important thing in thinking\nabout building machine learning teams, especially","start":1471.539,"duration":5.2},{"text":"when you get to the point where you have different\nspecializations and different goals of these","start":1476.739,"duration":3.88},{"text":"sub teams, is thinking about where the boundaries\nare between teams and how handover happens.","start":1480.619,"duration":5.93},{"text":"So one way that we've tried to address this\nat iRobot is we've built virtual teams that","start":1486.549,"duration":7.631},{"text":"work across team boundaries.","start":1494.18,"duration":1.379},{"text":"So for a particular application, there's somebody\nfrom the modeling team working on it, there's","start":1495.559,"duration":4.381},{"text":"somebody from the integration team working\nthere, somebody from the platform team working","start":1499.94,"duration":3.04},{"text":"on it and so they're there like a virtual\nteam that works across boundaries.","start":1502.98,"duration":5.129},{"text":"Because if otherwise, there could be some\ngaps in handover between teams.","start":1508.109,"duration":4.7},{"text":"So trying to build these integration points\nbetween the teams is really helpful in getting","start":1512.809,"duration":4.98},{"text":"an end application out the door.","start":1517.789,"duration":1.84},{"text":"Also it's really helpful to have these teams\nnot feel like there are these arbitrary walls","start":1519.629,"duration":6.841},{"text":"in between them so the virtual teaming that\nDanielle described is one way that we do that.","start":1526.47,"duration":4.5},{"text":"But making sure that the folks get a lot of\ntime together, discussing scientific papers,","start":1530.97,"duration":9.939},{"text":"getting together and talking about recent\ndevelopments, attending conferences together","start":1540.909,"duration":3.921},{"text":"so that there's really this strong culture\nthat allows for a lot of that connective tissue","start":1544.83,"duration":6.029},{"text":"to happen so that the gaps don't exist.","start":1550.859,"duration":2.94},{"text":"Things do fall through the cracks, there's\nno way to avoid that.","start":1553.799,"duration":3.401},{"text":"But the fact that we know it will happen,\nwe create a culture where folks are attentive","start":1557.2,"duration":5.699},{"text":"to it and intentional in seeking those things\nout to catch them rather than going, \"Well,","start":1562.899,"duration":5.931},{"text":"it's not my problem\".","start":1568.83,"duration":1.459},{"text":"So I think the fact that Danielle is really\nintentional about building that kind of cohesiveness,","start":1570.289,"duration":6.02},{"text":"that I'm really intentional about paying attention\nto that kind of cohesiveness is one of the","start":1576.309,"duration":4.43},{"text":"things that has been paying off in spades\nfor us in terms of the speed with which we","start":1580.739,"duration":5.091},{"text":"can get these things to happen and not have\nto constantly take two steps forward, one","start":1585.83,"duration":5.01},{"text":"step back of \"what didn't make it this last\ntime?\"","start":1590.84,"duration":3.949},{"text":"Is it a challenge for you to weigh the priorities\nof what the company needs in the models?","start":1594.789,"duration":8.671},{"text":"The company needs versus paper writing and\nacademic conferences, has that been an issue","start":1603.46,"duration":7.79},{"text":"for you?","start":1611.25,"duration":2.36},{"text":"Imagine..But that has been the case for 30\nyears; you hired the best and the brightest.","start":1613.61,"duration":6.049},{"text":"You hire people with a bias towards nerdery.","start":1619.659,"duration":2.86},{"text":"And obviously, all of us want to be big bad\nnerds, and big bad nerdery doesn't necessarily","start":1622.519,"duration":7.301},{"text":"always pay the bills.","start":1629.82,"duration":1.089},{"text":"So that's why having that iterative component\nand having a sister organization in the products","start":1630.909,"duration":5.49},{"text":"team, that is well plugged into what the end\ngoal is, because I think once we reframe how","start":1636.399,"duration":10.63},{"text":"the team talks about it and we stop the dichotomy\nof \"are we doing cool research or are we doing","start":1647.029,"duration":6.12},{"text":"boring product work?\", when we reframe it\nto 'are we solving a real problem?'","start":1653.149,"duration":7.051},{"text":"Not an abstraction.","start":1660.2,"duration":1.039},{"text":"Not a theoretical articulation of a problem.","start":1661.239,"duration":2.66},{"text":"But are we actually seeing in the data that\nwe're collecting back, the telemetry that's","start":1663.899,"duration":4.171},{"text":"aggregated for that we can look at?","start":1668.07,"duration":1.78},{"text":"Are we seeing qualitative impact into how\nhumans behave and how they behave with respect","start":1669.85,"duration":7.61},{"text":"to the behavior of their robot?","start":1677.46,"duration":2.069},{"text":"I think getting that and celebrating that\nand highlighting that, packaging that and","start":1679.529,"duration":3.931},{"text":"communicating that back to the team so that\nthey get jazzed about the fact that what they're","start":1683.46,"duration":3.76},{"text":"doing, that last long mile once you cross\nit, you can actually see a meaningful feedback.","start":1687.22,"duration":7.0},{"text":"I think that gets the team really excited\nto be able to play that game of research and","start":1694.22,"duration":11.73},{"text":"bottom line work in a much lighter way than\nI had been exposed to previously.","start":1705.95,"duration":6.789},{"text":"That's cool.","start":1712.739,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So like measuring and communicating.","start":1713.739,"duration":2.44},{"text":"And having, dashboards across the office where\nyou can see how things are moving, see how","start":1716.179,"duration":9.051},{"text":"the models converging both in test, but also\nwhenever it's deployed

just really becomes an interesting\nvirtuous cycle.","start":1742.1,"duration":4.559},{"text":"When you interview ML practitioners and those\nadjacent, do you interview for something a","start":1746.659,"duration":7.5},{"text":"little bit different than other companies,\nlike Microsoft or Google?","start":1754.159,"duration":6.541},{"text":"Is it the same stuff or is there

many\nfundamental differences with the way the transition","start":1789.6,"duration":8.299},{"text":"happened, is that right?","start":1797.899,"duration":3.13},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1801.029,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1802.029,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I can't think of any major differences.","start":1803.029,"duration":3.88},{"text":"I think a bias towards a love of hardware\nhelps,","start":1806.909,"duration":3.811},{"text":"Yeah.","start":1810.72,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I think if you don't love the fact that these\nthings are going to live outside of your own","start":1811.72,"duration":7.6},{"text":"realm, it's just not going to be as exciting.","start":1819.32,"duration":5.67},{"text":"And, you know, everybody wants to work with\nsomebody who's excited about what they're","start":1824.99,"duration":2.77},{"text":"doing.","start":1827.76,"duration":3.239},{"text":"I think that it does seem your kind of quality\ncontrol and testing must be pretty rigorous","start":1830.999,"duration":6.571},{"text":"because it's probably hard to go back and\nfix things.","start":1837.57,"duration":2.14},{"text":"Can you say a little bit about how you approach\nthat?","start":1839.71,"duration":4.75},{"text":"Model quality control and testing is a huge\npart of what we do and as much as we can.","start":1844.46,"duration":5.03},{"text":"A lot of these different layers we've automated\nso that when we're developing software, we","start":1849.49,"duration":4.779},{"text":"have automated tests that run even automated\ntests that run on the robots.","start":1854.269,"duration":4.081},{"text":"We think about it at almost every single layer\nof the system.","start":1858.35,"duration":3.209},{"text":"So from model algorithm development, thinking\nabout how do we validate our models off-line","start":1861.559,"duration":7.521},{"text":"and even that very first step is tricky, right?","start":1869.08,"duration":3.099},{"text":"Because we're building robots that run in\nthe real world across, millions of homes,","start":1872.179,"duration":5.82},{"text":"all the different variety of homes in the\nworld.","start":1877.999,"duration":2.351},{"text":"So even that first part of how do we test\nour models off-line to make sure that they","start":1880.35,"duration":4.66},{"text":"actually will work in the real world?","start":1885.01,"duration":1.45},{"text":"Even that is tricky.","start":1886.46,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But after we get over that hurdle, we then\nthink about the next step of deploying on","start":1887.46,"duration":4.459},{"text":"the robot and making sure all those pieces\nthat we need are together.","start":1891.919,"duration":3.291},{"text":"So from the model conversion process to what\npre-processing happens, to making sure that","start":1895.21,"duration":4.889},{"text":"the hardware that goes into the machine learning\nalgorithms is the same as the applications","start":1900.099,"duration":5.841},{"text":"that are developed when we develop the machine\nlearning model.","start":1905.94,"duration":2.689},{"text":"So thinking about the variety and hardware\nthat goes into the data collection aspects","start":1908.629,"duration":5.331},{"text":"and then where the machine learning model\nis running, that the software is running correctly..","start":1913.96,"duration":5.5},{"text":"So metrics for off-line, metrics for on the\nrobot, and then also once we deploy the model","start":1919.46,"duration":5.889},{"text":"in production, making sure that we monitor,\ncontinue to monitor that model and continue","start":1925.349,"duration":5.091},{"text":"to understand feedback and improvements so\nthat we can also send updates to the model","start":1930.44,"duration":4.549},{"text":"when necessary.","start":1934.989,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So there's a lot of different layers to that.","start":1935.989,"duration":1.851},{"text":"And it gets really complicated because we\nare thinking about how we can generalize to","start":1937.84,"duration":3.929},{"text":"the real world and the real homes; and there's\na lot of variety in that.","start":1941.769,"duration":4.51},{"text":"There's a component to testing that goes beyond\njust model quality and model applicability,","start":1946.279,"duration":4.681},{"text":"because these are robots that are in consumers'\nhomes.","start":1950.96,"duration":3.709},{"text":"So we also have a regulatory and a compliance\ncomponent to the testing.","start":1954.669,"duration":4.72},{"text":"So the Roomba, the Braava, they have a set\nof testing.","start":1959.389,"duration":5.17},{"text":"But also, when you start thinking about things\nlike the Tarot, which is the lawnmower, that","start":1964.559,"duration":6.07},{"text":"has a completely different kind of fail stop\nmechanism because it's got literal blades","start":1970.629,"duration":6.78},{"text":"that are cutting grass and you definitely\ndon't want it going over fido.","start":1977.409,"duration":4.07},{"text":"So we have this testing culture and mentality\nthat goes all the way from how the hardware","start":1981.479,"duration":9.101},{"text":"works, to how the software works, navigation,\nand then through all of this, the machine","start":1990.58,"duration":5.03},{"text":"learning features that are deployed through\nthese products, be they, you know, recommender","start":1995.61,"duration":5.78},{"text":"systems or computer vision types of applications.","start":2001.39,"duration":4.659},{"text":"Have there been any interesting surprises?","start":2006.049,"duration":3.44},{"text":"Like as you've gone from these specific unit\ntests to more bigger picture tests of production,","start":2009.489,"duration":6.291},{"text":"have there been any things where you are like\n'we didn't see that coming'?","start":2015.78,"duration":3.859},{"text":"I mean, I'd say there is....","start":2019.639,"duration":4.21},{"text":"It is amazing that you continue to find little\naspects and you continue to realize throughout","start":2023.849,"duration":6.45},{"text":"the journey how important testing is and not\njust for finding things, but actually helping","start":2030.299,"duration":5.1},{"text":"you move more efficiently.","start":2035.399,"duration":1.311},{"text":"So having checks at the different layers also\nhelps you debug faster.","start":2036.71,"duration":4.77},{"text":"It's not only knowing that something is going\nwrong and being proactive, but knowing something's","start":2041.48,"duration":5.62},{"text":"wrong and knowing where something is wrong\nin the system because we have tests at each","start":2047.1,"duration":4.329},{"text":"layer so that we can really hone into where\nthe problem is.","start":2051.429,"duration":4.261},{"text":"So I think that's something that I've really\nenjoyed seeing over time - how building in","start":2055.69,"duration":5.37},{"text":"these different layers helps us move more,\nmove faster in the long run.","start":2061.06,"duration":4.54},{"text":"So they've all worked perfectly to prediction.","start":2065.6,"duration":2.98},{"text":"Definitely not.","start":2068.58,"duration":1.29},{"text":"We've built up tests over time.","start":2069.87,"duration":3.71},{"text":"But it's really interesting because we've\nalso learned through this process the navel","start":2073.58,"duration":4.92},{"text":"gazing process of how do we test, how do we\nensure and how we root cause.","start":2078.5,"duration":4.3},{"text":"We also noticed that across iRobot, our team\nis getting called to help other teams root","start":2082.8,"duration":4.92},{"text":"cause what they're going through because of\nthe way that we interact with data.","start":2087.72,"duration":5.52},{"text":"We have brilliant technologists, roboticists\nand algorithmcists, but they are not all trained","start":2093.24,"duration":6.1},{"text":"in the gospel of data and dealing with really\nlarge data sets that require imputation that","start":2099.34,"duration":6.02},{"text":"are gappy, that aren't necessarily fully representative,\ncomprehensive of what it is that a software","start":2105.36,"duration":6.82},{"text":"developer has access to when they're looking\nat how their IDE is responding to them.","start":2112.18,"duration":4.55},{"text":"So we are able to bring that and help different\nteams that sometimes have nothing to do with","start":2116.73,"duration":5.55},{"text":"machine learning; to help them look through\nthe information that our robots are sending","start":2122.28,"duration":5.57},{"text":"back at telemetry, whatever it may be, and\nthen help them build tooling that looks at","start":2127.85,"duration":5.95},{"text":"fleet data to help them towards their specific\nscenarios, even completely unrelated to machine","start":2133.8,"duration":7.52},{"text":"learning altogether.","start":2141.32,"duration":1.59},{"text":"How do you think about testing models that\nare inherently non-deterministic or at least,","start":2142.91,"duration":7.71},{"text":"you can't be sure that they're going to be\naccurate every single time?","start":2150.62,"duration":3.57},{"text":"Do you have some threshold or do you look\nfor distribution drift?","start":2154.19,"duration":5.73},{"text":"This is something that we actually think about\na lot because of our systems.","start":2159.92,"duration":3.68},{"text":"We also have data deletion requests that come\nin and obviously we comply and think about","start":2163.6,"duration":4.06},{"text":"how we build in user trust and user privacy\ninto our system.","start":2167.66,"duration":3.28},{"text":"So we think about this a lot because our source\ndata actually changes as a result of data","start":2170.94,"duration":4.8},{"text":"deletion requests.","start":2175.74,"duration":1.0},{"text":"And so thinking about how to build reproducible\npipelines that we know, what are the components","start":2176.74,"duration":5.47},{"text":"that went into that pipeline so that we can\nrecreate training datasets based on both the","start":2182.21,"duration":4.61},{"text":"distribution and based on what data went into\nthat model originally, minus the data that","start":2186.82,"duration":5.1},{"text":"was deleted or things that came into the system\nand new data that feeds in as well, because","start":2191.92,"duration":4.87},{"text":"we also want to supplement our data sources\nwith any new data so we can improve over time","start":2196.79,"duration":4.43},{"text":"and and get better features in the end.","start":2201.22,"duration":2.991},{"text":"So we think a lot about how to create reproducible\npipelines, how do we track work?","start":2204.211,"duration":4.389},{"text":"This is really fascinating.","start":2208.6,"duration":1.48},{"text":"So when you say reproducible pipeline, but\nthe data is changing, what exactly does that","start":2210.08,"duration":4.89},{"text":"mean?","start":2214.97,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It means understanding exactly what distribution\nwe're pulling from and what sources

the model.","start":2226.74,"duration":1.27},{"text":"So I see, the process is reproducible.","start":2228.01,"duration":3.66},{"text":"Yes, exactly.","start":2231.67,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But also, whenever we do reach some convergent\nmodel that the interpretability and the explainability","start":2232.67,"duration":7.31},{"text":"of that model while all of the training data\nis still there as intended and designed is","start":2239.98,"duration":8.48},{"text":"really important because of the ephemerality\nof that data.","start":2248.46,"duration":2.84},{"text":"So if the underlying

have these reproducible pipeline and reproducible\nmetrics at each layer of the system that we","start":2306.43,"duration":6.59},{"text":"know","start":2313.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"That's interesting.","start":2314.02,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So these metrics, when you say these metrics\nwe talked about, you're referring to the end-to-end","start":2315.02,"duration":6.91},{"text":"product or business metrics or do you mean\nsomething specific to that model?","start":2321.93,"duration":3.77},{"text":"Both.","start":2325.7,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So with model metrics that come out as well\nas how that model performs in the bigger system,","start":2326.7,"duration":8.05},{"text":"which there could be a whole other system\nthat it's interacting with on the robot, you","start":2334.75,"duration":4.83},{"text":"need to think through both the model metrics\nand we might need to actually tune the model","start":2339.58,"duration":4.17},{"text":"differently in order to optimize the system\nmetrics.","start":2343.75,"duration":3.2},{"text":"So thinking about those different layers to\nbe able to reproduce, capturing metrics and","start":2346.95,"duration":4.84},{"text":"then creating those reproducible pipelines\nand how we think about approaching that problem.","start":2351.79,"duration":5.9},{"text":"Interesting.","start":2357.69,"duration":2.19},{"text":"And have you seen modern techniques?","start":2359.88,"duration":3.2},{"text":"How much has modeling improvements improved\nthese metrics?","start":2363.08,"duration":4.9},{"text":"Has that been important to you?","start":2367.98,"duration":1.2},{"text":"I mean, some people say, \"oh, it's just about\nthe data\".","start":2369.18,"duration":1.75},{"text":"Some people say \"we'll know deeper, more

things?","start":2381.0,"duration":2.52},{"text":"So I'd say data first.","start":2383.52,"duration":4.36},{"text":"For our use cases, because we're trying to\nhit all of the users, all of the houses, we","start":2387.88,"duration":7.56},{"text":"are able to generalize to the world and all\nthe variety of the world and making sure that","start":2395.44,"duration":6.57},{"text":"our data is

world.","start":2409.2,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Yeah.","start":2410.2,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So threshold or threshold between one room\nand the

environment within which it","start":2438.7,"duration":4.8},{"text":"operates is static.","start":2443.5,"duration":2.43},{"text":"And so that's the constraint, which is why\nwe value the data

essentially.","start":2451.1,"duration":4.27},{"text":"Absolutely.","start":2455.37,"duration":1.39},{"text":"And the other aspect is the algorithms that\nrun on low

big difference.","start":2466.891,"duration":2.129},{"text":"So thinking about that area, I think there\nis a lot of room to go in terms of how much","start":2469.02,"duration":7.05},{"text":"algorithm improvements can make a difference.","start":2476.07,"duration":3.1},{"text":"Did they matter to you over the last couple\nof years, like the

curious.","start":2501.37,"duration":3.01},{"text":"When you think about hyper parameter searches,\nthat's an auto ML, is that something you do","start":2504.38,"duration":4.78},{"text":"a lot of?","start":2509.16,"duration":1.04},{"text":"Does that help you much?","start":2510.2,"duration":2.26},{"text":"Yeah, we definitely leverage hyper parameter\nsearch and auto ML type capabilities to

tough one.","start":2544.75,"duration":4.43},{"text":"Both.","start":2549.18,"duration":1.11},{"text":"Obvious.","start":2550.29,"duration":1.11},{"text":"Fair","start":2551.4,"duration":1.1},{"text":"I mean, if we had infinite researches, I would\nagree.","start":2552.5,"duration":4.22},{"text":"But I think looking back at what we've actually\nhad to overcome over the last year and a half,","start":2556.72,"duration":11.61},{"text":"I'd say that data augmentation has been more\nof a throttling or a bottleneck to us.","start":2568.33,"duration":9.22},{"text":"I'm not sure that that is always going to\nbe the case.","start":2577.55,"duration":3.16},{"text":"But specifically.","start":2580.71,"duration":1.0},{"text":"It's been a problem for you or it's been helpful\nto you?","start":2581.71,"duration":3.03},{"text":"It's been helpful.","start":2584.74,"duration":1.59},{"text":"So it solved the thing that was a real problem\nfor us, a bigger problem.","start":2586.33,"duration":4.77},{"text":"So the ability to understand every environment\nfrom day zero, right?","start":2591.1,"duration":9.79},{"text":"Once a robot starts going around a

us.","start":2629.39,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But I'm not sure that that is always going\nto be the case which is why I think both if","start":2630.39,"duration":7.37},{"text":"we had infinite resources.","start":2637.76,"duration":1.86},{"text":"Its early 2020, things change for sure.","start":2639.62,"duration":4.49},{"text":"Have you focusd on one deep learning framework?","start":2644.11,"duration":5.29},{"text":"Is that Tensor flow or PyTorch or do you love\nScikit?","start":2649.4,"duration":4.46},{"text":"Or is it all of the above?","start":2653.86,"duration":2.74},{"text":"It depends on the team.","start":2656.6,"duration":1.85},{"text":"When we're talking more about the reinforcement\nlearning team or the modeling team, I think","start":2658.45,"duration":4.83},{"text":"they get more leeway in experimenting because\nthat's the role.","start":2663.28,"duration":5.7},{"text":"Like, it is the stuff that we've settled on\n- continuing to work for what we want and","start":2668.98,"duration":5.64},{"text":"will age pave the way for what we are going\nto want.","start":2674.62,"duration":3.61},{"text":"So those folks test a little bit more, go\na little bit more wild into the research and","start":2678.23,"duration":7.921},{"text":"what's available and what are the state of\nthe art improvements and how can we make those","start":2686.151,"duration":5.859},{"text":"applicable within the environments that we\noperate in?","start":2692.01,"duration":3.16},{"text":"I think when we're talking about the integration\nand the infrastructure teams, they're focused","start":2695.17,"duration":6.36},{"text":"on different things.","start":2701.53,"duration":2.1},{"text":"So they are much more focused on that last\nmile and so re-architecting all of our tooling,","start":2703.63,"duration":9.64},{"text":"unless there is a really important benefit\nthat we get from that, because at that point","start":2713.27,"duration":6.07},{"text":"you're impacting all of the platforms that\nmay make use of this one deliverable and a","start":2719.34,"duration":4.64},{"text":"lot of those platforms are already in homes.","start":2723.98,"duration":2.63},{"text":"So if we have to re-architect how all of that\ndelivery happens, there are a lot of teams","start":2726.61,"duration":9.96},{"text":"and there's a lot of integration that needs\nto take place.","start":2736.57,"duration":2.02},{"text":"And so is it worthwhile to spend those resources?","start":2738.59,"duration":3.81},{"text":"The farther into the process we get, the harder\nit is to stay, to modify and to tinker with","start":2742.4,"duration":9.87},{"text":"that stuff.","start":2752.27,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But I think the modeling team.","start":2753.27,"duration":1.61},{"text":"Yes.","start":2754.88,"duration":1.1},{"text":"And I think they've done Tensor flow, and\nSciKit line is always a favorite of all.","start":2755.98,"duration":7.21},{"text":"I think we've dabbled in PyTorch and figured\nout it isn't working for us.","start":2763.19,"duration":4.47},{"text":"But once it gets down farther into the pipeline,\nit is much more into what's already working","start":2767.66,"duration":6.74},{"text":"and 'is it worthwhile to throw a bomb in there'?","start":2774.4,"duration":4.55},{"text":"Can you say what's already working?","start":2778.95,"duration":3.44},{"text":"Not yet.","start":2782.39,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But we look forward to coming back and sharing\na more details on all of that.","start":2783.39,"duration":5.15},{"text":"Cool.","start":2788.54,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Can't wait.","start":2789.54,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I want to be respectful of your time.","start":2790.54,"duration":1.6},{"text":"I think we've gone a little over.","start":2792.14,"duration":1.57},{"text":"I'm hoping to end with a couple of questions,\nif you don't mind.","start":2793.71,"duration":4.12},{"text":"We've been asking everyone.","start":2797.83,"duration":1.93},{"text":"So here's my first one; what is the one underrated\naspect of machine learning that you think","start":2799.76,"duration":5.39},{"text":"people should pay more attention to?","start":2805.15,"duration":2.54},{"text":"Oh, the data.","start":2807.69,"duration":8.28},{"text":"The data is so important for making sure that\nit's generalizable, making sure that actually","start":2815.97,"duration":7.36},{"text":"figuring out your metrics are all going to\nbe based on the data that you're using.","start":2823.33,"duration":6.43},{"text":"And so how do you know the metrics of the\nmodel or the metrics of the system are actually","start":2829.76,"duration":4.3},{"text":"metrics that you believe are useful to represent\nthings?","start":2834.06,"duration":3.98},{"text":"Because at the end of the day, it's all about\nthe data that goes into the system.","start":2838.04,"duration":4.02},{"text":"And it's not just the volume.","start":2842.06,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I mean, one hundred percent.","start":2843.06,"duration":1.05},{"text":"It's the data.","start":2844.11,"duration":1.0},{"text":"But it's not just the volume, the variety\nor the velocity of it, like the fancy 3D.","start":2845.11,"duration":6.18},{"text":"But it's the quality of it.","start":2851.29,"duration":2.14},{"text":"So are we only looking at data that's streaming\nback from us?","start":2853.43,"duration":4.22},{"text":"From customers who are already happy?","start":2857.65,"duration":2.6},{"text":"Which means we're not solving the problem\nfor the folks who aren't already happy to","start":2860.25,"duration":3.32},{"text":"begin with.","start":2863.57,"duration":1.0},{"text":"We're not solving the problems for the folks\nwho aren't using the product that they've","start":2864.57,"duration":3.32},{"text":"already paid for and we're not delighting\nthem.","start":2867.89,"duration":2.48},{"text":"So it's not just that we have data, but is\nthat data reflective of the whole?","start":2870.37,"duration":4.68},{"text":"And how do we ensure that the next thing that\nwe do isn't just improving marginally the","start":2875.05,"duration":7.35},{"text":"experience of a fraction of our customers,\nbut yes data.","start":2882.4,"duration":4.68},{"text":"100% data.","start":2887.08,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Underlined.","start":2888.08,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Why do you think it's so hard for the industry\nto realize how it could still be underrated?","start":2889.08,"duration":5.51},{"text":"Seems blindingly obvious from where I sit.","start":2894.59,"duration":2.55},{"text":"I don't think that it's underrated.","start":2897.14,"duration":2.27},{"text":"I think when you ask this question, you probably\nget the same answer.","start":2899.41,"duration":3.6},{"text":"It's not like it's underrated.","start":2903.01,"duration":3.05},{"text":"It's just hard.","start":2906.06,"duration":1.83},{"text":"It's known to be valuable.","start":2907.89,"duration":1.36},{"text":"It's also known to be really hard.","start":2909.25,"duration":1.96},{"text":"They know a few companies that will collect\nhigh quality data.","start":2911.21,"duration":6.98},{"text":"No doubt.","start":2918.19,"duration":2.34},{"text":"So, next question.","start":2920.53,"duration":3.5},{"text":"What is the biggest challenge in making machine\nlearning actually work in the real world from","start":2924.03,"duration":3.92},{"text":"where you sit?","start":2927.95,"duration":1.0},{"text":"When you start a research team coming up with\nsomething and some crazy framework to actually","start":2928.95,"duration":1.0},{"text":"getting it deployed, what is the hardest part\nof that?","start":2929.95,"duration":1.0},{"text":"What makes you the most nervous?","start":2930.95,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So a really tough learning for me was not\nat iRobot.","start":2931.95,"duration":2.92},{"text":"It was at the company that I was at before.","start":2934.87,"duration":6.55},{"text":"We had this amazing solution; a machine learning\nalgorithm that was for energy efficiency and","start":2941.42,"duration":7.49},{"text":"it predicted when there might be a spike on\nthe utilization of the energy grid or something","start":2948.91,"duration":6.08},{"text":"of that nature.","start":2954.99,"duration":1.46},{"text":"And it worked really well.","start":2956.45,"duration":1.08},{"text":"It was really fantastic.","start":2957.53,"duration":1.0},{"text":"We were all proud of it and it didn't sell.","start":2958.53,"duration":2.65},{"text":"And so the really important thing is communicating\nto the right people.","start":2961.18,"duration":4.31},{"text":"What is it that they're getting and what is\nthe value?","start":2965.49,"duration":4.09},{"text":"Because I think and I was blinded by this,\ntoo.","start":2969.58,"duration":2.7},{"text":"I'm not saying that I was smart and I knew\nit and nobody did.","start":2972.28,"duration":2.26},{"text":"Nobody else did.","start":2974.54,"duration":1.0},{"text":"I wasn't above it.","start":2975.54,"duration":4.04},{"text":"I fell for the mirage of how delightful and\nwonderful and sexy and how performant and","start":2979.58,"duration":8.44},{"text":"correct it all was.","start":2988.02,"duration":1.68},{"text":"And that doesn't matter.","start":2989.7,"duration":1.43},{"text":"Like if it doesn't actually solve a real problem\nthat a real human is willing to part money","start":2991.13,"duration":3.62},{"text":"with in order to have that problem solved\nfor them, it doesn't matter how sophisticated","start":2994.75,"duration":5.2},{"text":"it is or how much data you have on solving\nthe right problem.","start":2999.95,"duration":5.34},{"text":"Danielle, I don't know if you have a different\nanecdote or a different experience.","start":3005.29,"duration":14.48},{"text":"So one of the biggest challenges that I see\nwith machine learning systems in the real","start":3019.77,"duration":6.28},{"text":"world and getting them out there is, there's\na lot of different pieces that need to go","start":3026.05,"duration":4.05},{"text":"in to make this right.","start":3030.1,"duration":1.26},{"text":"With the data collection piece, the training\npart, the processing, the model serving, the","start":3031.36,"duration":6.74},{"text":"software pieces, the hardware pieces, the\nhardware.","start":3038.1,"duration":3.59},{"text":"In our case, the hardware changes over time\nand we also need to make sure the data reflects","start":3041.69,"duration":3.76},{"text":"that hardware changes over time.","start":3045.45,"duration":1.86},{"text":"There's the different homes, the different\ncustomers, making sure that it's actually","start":3047.31,"duration":3.82},{"text":"generalizable.","start":3051.13,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I think there's so many pieces making sure\nthat you have quality checks in place on those","start":3052.13,"duration":5.55},{"text":"different pieces so that when things don't\nwork as well in general or for a specific","start":3057.68,"duration":5.31},{"text":"customer, we have ways to make it better so\nthat the quality at the end of the day is","start":3062.99,"duration":4.21},{"text":"what the customer is expecting.","start":3067.2,"duration":1.0},{"text":"So I think that's the biggest challenge, is\njust connecting all those pieces together","start":3068.2,"duration":3.93},{"text":"and making it real.","start":3072.13,"duration":2.06},{"text":"Cool.","start":3074.19,"duration":1.0},{"text":"Final question, you know if people enjoyed\nthis, I bet a lot of people are really
